S. 539</a></p><p> home to make a routine felony arrest.  The question before us in the present case is whether the rule announced in <em>Payton</em> applies to an arrest that took place before <em>Payton</em> was decided.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Special Agents Hemenway and Pickering of the United States Secret Service suspected respondent Raymond Eugene Johnson and his codefendant, Oscar Joseph Dodd, of attempting to negotiate a misdelivered United States Treasury check. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Proceeding without an arrest warrant, on May 5, 1977, the two agents went to respondent\'s Los Angeles home and waited outside.  Shortly thereafter, respondent and his wife arrived and entered the house.</p>\n<p>The agents drew their weapons, approached the doorway, and knocked, identifying themselves by fictitious names.  When respondent opened the door, he saw the two agents with their guns drawn and their badges raised.  Respondent permitted the agents to enter the house.  While one agent stood with respondent in the living room, the other searched the premises.  The agents then advised respondent of his constitutional rights and interrogated him.  When respondent revealed his involvement in the taking of the misdelivered check, the agents formally arrested him.  Respondent later signed a written statement admitting his involvement with the check.</p>\n<p>Before trial, respondent sought to suppress his oral and written statements as fruits of an unlawful arrest not supported </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 457 U. S. 540</a></p><p> by probable cause.  The United States District Court for the Central District of California found respondent\'s arrest to be proper, and admitted the evidence.  App. 7.  A jury then convicted respondent of aiding and abetting obstruction of correspondence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2 and 1702. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The imposition of respondent\'s sentence was suspended in favor of five years\' probation.</p>\n<p>By an unreported opinion filed December 19, 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction.  Acknowledging that "[i]t certainly would have been preferable had the agents obtained a warrant" for respondent\'s arrest before entering his residence, the court nonetheless ruled that</p>\n<p>"if probable cause exists for the arrest, [respondent\'s] constitutional rights were not violated by the warrantless arrest, even though there may have been time [for the agents] to have obtained a warrant for his arrest."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-27a.</p>\n<p>On April 15, 1980, while respondent\'s petition for rehearing was still pending before the Ninth Circuit, this Court decided <em>Payton v. New York, supra.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  On September 2, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 457 U. S. 541</a></p><p> 1980, the Ninth Circuit granted respondent\' petition for rehearing, withdrew its prior opinion, and on the strength of <em>Payton,</em> now reversed the judgment of conviction.  626 F.2d 753.</p>\n<p>"In light of the strong language by the Court in <em>Payton</em> emphasizing the special protection the Constitution affords to individuals within their homes,"</p>\n<p>the Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<p>"the warrantless arrest of Johnson, while he stood within his home, after having opened the door in response to false identification by the agents, constituted a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 757.  The Government petitioned for rehearing, arguing that the principles of <em>Payton</em> should not apply retroactively to an arrest that had occurred before <em>Payton</em> was decided.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, denied the petition for rehearing, and amended its opinion to clarify that <em>Payton</em> did apply retroactively.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government sought review in this Court.

S. 629</a></span>.  Since <em>Linkletter,</em> the Court\'s announcement of a constitutional rule in the realm of criminal procedure has frequently been followed by a separate decision explaining whether, and to what extent, that rule applies to past, pending, and future cases.  <em>See generally</em> Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity:  A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va.L.Rev. 1557 (1975).</p>\n<p><em>Linkletter</em> itself addressed the question whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961), should apply to state convictions that had become final before <em>Mapp</em> was decided. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  At the outset, the <em>Linkletter</em> Court noted that cases still pending on direct review when <em>Mapp</em> was handed down had already received the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 457 U. S. 543</a></p><p> benefit of <em>Mapp\'s</em> rule.  <em>See</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#622">381 U.

California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/483/case.html">376 U. S. 483</a></span> (1964).  This limited retrospective application of <em>Mapp</em> was consistent with the common law rule, recognized in both civil and criminal litigation, "that a change in law will be given effect while a case is on direct review."  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#627">381 U.

Schooner Peggy,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 103 (1801).</p>\n<p>To determine whether a particular ruling should also extend to cases that were already final, <em>Linkletter</em> directed courts to</p>\n<p>"weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation."</p>\n<p>381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#629">381 U. S. 629</a></span>.  Employing that test, the Court concluded that the <em>Mapp</em> rule should not apply to convictions that had become final before <em>Mapp</em> was decided.</p>\n<p>The following Term, in <em>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html">382 U. S. 406</a></span> (1966), the Court applied <em>Linkletter\'s</em> analysis to hold the Fifth Amendment rule of <em>Griffin v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html">380 U. S. 609</a></span> (1965) (barring comment on a state defendant\'s failure to testify), nonretroactive to judgments of conviction made final before <em>Griffin</em> was decided.  The Court again found no "question of the applicability of the <em>Griffin</em> rule to cases still pending on direct review at the time it was announced."  382 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html#409">382 U.

Thus, after <em>Linkletter</em> and <em>Shott,</em> it appeared that all newly declared constitutional rules of criminal procedure would apply retrospectively at least to judgments of conviction not yet final when the rule was established.</p>\n<p>In <em>Johnson v.

Those cases held that, in the interest of justice, the Court may balance three factors to determine whether a "new" constitutional rule should be retrospectively </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 457 U. S. 544</a></p><p> or prospectively applied:</p>\n<p>"(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html#297">388 U.

Because the outcome of that balancing process might call for different degrees of retroactivity in different cases, the Court concluded that "no distinction is justified between convictions now final . . . and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review."  <em>Stovall v.

We therefore examine the circumstances of this case to determine whether it presents a retroactivity question clearly controlled by past precedents, and if not, whether application of the Harlan approach would resolve the retroactivity issue presented in a principled and equitable manner.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>At the outset, we must first ask whether respondent\'s case presents a retrospectivity problem clearly controlled by existing precedent.  Reexamination of the post-<em>Linkletter</em> decisions convinces us that, in three narrow categories of cases, the answer to the retroactivity question has been effectively determined not by application of the <em>Stovall</em> factors, but rather through application of a threshold test. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 457 U. S. 549</a></p><p></p>\n<p>First, when a decision of this Court merely has applied settled precedents to new and different factual situations, no real question has arisen as to whether the later decision should apply retrospectively.  In such cases, it has been a foregone conclusion that the rule of the later case applies in earlier cases, because the later decision has not, in fact, altered that rule in any material way.  <em>See, e.g., Dunaway v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html">442 U.

S. 248</a></span>, it almost invariably has gone on to find such a newly minted principle nonretroactive.  <em>See United States v. Peltier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html">422 U.

In this second type of case, the traits of the particular constitutional rule have been less critical than the Court\'s express threshold determination that the "<em>new\' constitutional interpretatio[n] . . . so change[s] the law that prospectivity is arguably the proper course," <em>Williams v. United States,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html#659">401 U. S. 659</a></span> (plurality opinion).  Once the Court has found that the new rule was unanticipated, the second and third <em>Stovall</em> factors -- reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards and effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule -- have virtually </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 457 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Third, the Court has recognized full retroactivity as a necessary adjunct to a ruling that a trial court lacked authority to convict or punish a criminal defendant in the first place.  The Court has invalidated inconsistent prior judgments where its reading of a particular constitutional guarantee immunizes a defendant\'s conduct from punishment, <em>see, e.g., United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/715/case.html">401 U.

Nor did <em>Payton</em> disapprove an established practice that the Court had previously sanctioned.  To the extent that the Court earlier had spoken to the conduct engaged in by the police officers in <em>Payton,</em> it had deemed it of doubtful constitutionality. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Court\'s own analysis in <em>Payton</em> makes it clear that its ruling rested on both long-recognized principles of Fourth Amendment law and the weight of historical authority as it had appeared to the Framers of the Fourth Amendment.

S. 248</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is equally plain that <em>Payton</em> does not fall into the third category of cases that do not pose difficult retroactivity questions. <em>Payton</em> did not hold that the trial court lacked authority to convict or sentence Theodore Payton, nor did <em>Payton\'s</em> reading of the Fourth Amendment immunize Payton\'s conduct from punishment.  The holding in <em>Payton</em> did not prevent the defendant\'s trial from taking place; rather, it reversed the New York Court of Appeals\' judgment and remanded for a new trial to be conducted without unconstitutionally obtained evidence.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Having determined that the retroactivity question here is not clearly controlled by our prior precedents, we next must ask whether that question would be fairly resolved by applying the rule in <em>Payton</em> to all cases still pending on direct appeal at the time when <em>Payton</em> was decided.  Answering that question affirmatively would satisfy each of the three concerns stated in Justice Harlan\'s opinions in <em>Desist</em> and <em>Mackey.</em></p>\n<p>First, retroactive application of <em>Payton</em> to all previously nonfinal convictions would provide a principle of decisionmaking consonant with our original understanding of retroactivity in <em>Linkletter</em> and <em>Shott.</em>  Moreover, such a principle would be one capable of general applicability, satisfying Justice Harlan\'s central concern:</p>\n<p>"Refusal to apply new constitutional rules to all cases arising on direct review . . . tends to cut this Court loose from the force of precedent, allowing us </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 457 U. S. 555</a></p><p> to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law, and thereby mitigate the practical force of <em>stare decisis,</em> . . . a force which ought properly to bear on the judicial resolution of any legal problem."</p>\n<p><em>Mackey v. United States,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#680">401 U. S. 680</a></span>-681 (separate opinion).</p>\n<p>Second, application of <em>Payton</em> to cases pending on direct review would comport with our judicial responsibilities "to do justice to each litigant on the merits of his own case," <em>Desist v. United States,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#259">394 U. S. 259</a></span> (Harlan, J., dissenting), and to "resolve all cases before us on direct review in light of our best understanding of governing constitutional principles."  <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#679">401 U. S. 679</a></span> (separate opinion of Harlan, J.).  The Court of Appeals held that the circumstances of respondent\'s arrest violated <em>Payton,</em> and the Government does not dispute that contention.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra.</em>  It would be ironic indeed were we now to reverse a judgment applying <em>Payton\'s</em> rule when, in <em>Payton</em> itself, we reversed a directly contrary judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.  As Justice Harlan noted in <em>Desist:</em></p>\n<p>"If a \'new\' constitutional doctrine is truly right, we should not reverse lower courts which have accepted it; nor should we affirm those which have rejected the very arguments we have embraced."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#259">394 U. S. 259</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Third, application of the Harlan approach to respondent\'s case would further the goal of treating similarly situated defendants similarly.  The Government contends that respondent may not invoke <em>Payton,</em> because he was arrested before <em>Payton</em> was decided.  Yet it goes without saying that Theodore Payton also was arrested before <em>Payton</em> was decided, and he received the benefit of the rule in his case.  Furthermore, at least one other defendant whose conviction was not final when <em>Payton</em> issued benefited from <em>Payton\'s</em> rule, although he, too, was arrested before <em>Payton</em> was decided. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 457 U. S. 556</a></p><p> An approach that resolved all nonfinal convictions under the same rule of law would lessen the possibility that this Court might mete out different constitutional protection to defendants simultaneously subjected to identical police conduct.

S. 557</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Against adoption of this approach, the Government raises four arguments based on <em>United States v. Peltier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html">422 U. S. 531</a></span> (1975).  None is persuasive.</p>\n<p>The Government first cites <em>Peltier\'s</em> holding:  that the Fourth Amendment rule announced in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html">413 U. S. 266</a></span> (1973), should not apply retroactively to a case pending on appeal when <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> was announced.  By so holding, the Government suggests, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 457 U. S. 558</a></p><p> <em>Peltier</em> declared a principle that controls the issue of retroactivity for all Fourth Amendment rulings. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Upon examination, however, the retroactivity question posed here differs from that presented in <em>Peltier.</em>  As the Government concedes, <em>Payton</em> overturned neither a statute nor any consistent judicial history approving nonconsensual, warrantless home entries.  <em>See</em> Brief for United States 30, n. 18.  Thus, its nonretroactivity is not preordained under the "clear break" principles stated above.  In <em>Peltier,</em> in contrast, the Court noted that <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> had invalidated a form of search previously sanctioned by "a validly enacted statute, supported by longstanding administrative regulations and continuous judicial approval."  422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#541">422 U. S. 541</a></span>.  <em>See also Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html#278">413 U. S. 278</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring) ("While the question is one of first impression in this Court," the practice disapproved had "been consistently approved by the judiciary"); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html#298">413 U. S. 298</a></span>-299, n. 10 (WHITE, J., dissenting) (35 of 36 judges in 20 Court of Appeals cases had approved the invalidated practice).</p>\n<p>Because <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> had overturned a longstanding practice to which this Court had not spoken, but which a near-unanimous body of lower court authority had approved, it represented a "clear break" with the past.  For that reason alone, under controlling retroactivity precedents, the nonretroactive application of <em>Almeida-Sanchez</em> would have been appropriate even if the case had involved no Fourth Amendment question.  In that respect, <em>Peltier</em> resembles several earlier decisions that held "new" Fourth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 457 U. S. 559</a></p><p> doctrine nonretroactive, not on the ground that all Fourth Amendment rulings apply only prospectively, but because the particular decisions being applied "so change[d] the law that prospectivity [was] arguably the proper course."  <em>Williams v.

S. 438</a></span> (1928)).</p>\n<p>The Government bases its second argument on <em>Peltier\'s</em> broad language:</p>\n<p>"If the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct, then evidence obtained from a search should be suppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had <em>knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge,</em> that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment"</p>\n<p>(emphasis added).  422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#542">422 U. S. 542</a></span>.  The Government reads this language to require that new Fourth Amendment rules must be denied retroactive effect in all cases except those in which law enforcement officers failed to act in good faith compliance with then-prevailing constitutional norms.</p>\n<p>The Government does not seriously suggest that the retroactivity of a given Fourth Amendment ruling should turn solely on the subjective state of a particular arresting officer\'s mind.  Instead, it offers an "objective" test:  that law enforcement officers "may properly be charged with knowledge" of all "settled" Fourth Amendment law.  Under the Government\'s theory, because the state of Fourth Amendment law regarding warrantless home arrests was "unsettled" before <em>Payton,</em> that ruling should not apply retroactively even to cases pending on direct appeal when <em>Payton</em> was decided.  <em>See</em> Brief for United States 14-19, 34-38. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 457 U. S. 560</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Yet the Government\'s reading of <em>Peltier</em> would reduce its own "retroactivity test" to an absurdity.  Under this view, the only Fourth Amendment rulings worthy of retroactive application are those in which the arresting officers violated preexisting guidelines clearly established by prior cases.  But as we have seen above, cases involving simple application of clear, preexisting Fourth Amendment guidelines raise no real questions of retroactivity at all.  Literally read, the Government\'s theory would automatically eliminate <em>all</em> Fourth Amendment rulings from consideration for retroactive application.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s third claim is that <em>Peltier\'s</em> logic suggests that retroactive application of Fourth Amendment decisions like <em>Payton</em> -- even to cases pending on direct review -- would not serve the policies underlying the exclusionary rule.  <em>Cf.</em> 422 U.S. at 536-542.  Yet viewed in the light of <em>Peltier\'s</em> holding, this assertion also fails.  <em>Peltier</em> suggested only that retroactive application of a Fourth Amendment ruling that worked a "sharp break" in the law, like <em>Almeida-Sanchez,</em> would have little deterrent effect, because law enforcement officers would rarely be deterred from engaging in a practice they never expected to be invalidated.  <em>See</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#541">422 U. S. 541</a></span>-542.</p>\n<p>This logic does not apply to a ruling like <em>Payton,</em> that resolved a previously unsettled point of Fourth Amendment law.  Because this Court cannot rule on every unsettled Fourth Amendment question, years may pass before the Court finally invalidates a police practice of dubious constitutionality.  <em>See, e.g., Desist v. United States,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#275">394 U. S. 275</a></span> (Fortas, J., dissenting) (arguing that the "physical trespass" wiretap rule of <em>Olmstead v.

Long before <em>Payton,</em> for example, this Court had questioned the constitutionality of warrantless home arrests.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F13" name="T13">n</a> 13, <em>supra.</em>  Furthermore, the Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 457 U. S. 561</a></p><p> opinions consistently had emphasized that, in light of the constitutional protection traditionally accorded to the privacy of the home, police officers should resolve any doubts regarding the validity of a home arrest in favor of obtaining a warrant.  <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/10/case.html">333 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Official awareness of the dubious constitutionality of a practice would be counterbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the Fourth Amendment law in the area remained unsettled, evidence obtained through the questionable practice would be excluded only in the one case definitively resolving the unsettled question.  Failure to accord <em>any</em> retroactive effect to Fourth Amendment rulings would "encourage police or other courts to disregard the plain purport of our decisions and to adopt a <em>let\'s wait until it\'s decided\' approach."  <em>Desist v.

Justice Harlan gave the answer to this assertion.</p>\n<p>"We do not release a criminal from jail because we like to do so, or because we think it wise to do so, but only because the government has offended constitutional principle in the conduct of his case.  And when another similarly situated defendant comes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 457 U.

Three other Circuits had assumed, without expressly deciding, that such searches were unlawful.  <em>Ibid.</em>  After one of those decisions, in 1978, the Department of Justice instructed federal law enforcement agencies to follow the practice of procuring arrest warrants before entering a suspect\'s home to arrest him without exigent circumstances.  Brief for United States 33, n. 20.</p>\n<p>In the Ninth Circuit, where respondent was arrested, it has been said that "law enforcement officials knew that th[e] circuit\'s law was unsettled, but that there was some drift toward a warrant requirement."  <em>United States v. Blake,</em> 632 F.2d at 736.  <em>United States v. Phillips,</em> 497 F.2d 1131, 1135 (CA9 1974), had suggested in dictum that warrants are required before officers may enter a private dwelling to effect an arrest.  In <em>United States v.

United States,</em> 429 U.S. 1064 (1977), it was observed that the Government had agreed that, absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect\'s home would be illegal.  <em>United States v. Prescott,</em> 581 F.2d at 1360, then squarely held such arrests unconstitutional.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals affirmed Payton\'s conviction along with that of Obie Riddick.  <em>See Payton v.

New York,</em> 446 U.S. 902 (1980); <em>Brown v. Florida,</em> 446 U.S. 902 (1980); <em>Busch v. Florida,</em> 446 U.S. 902 (1980); <em>Vidal v.

We took four of them and held the rest, and then disposed of each of the four, applying the new procedural rule retroactively.

Any other single case in the group or any other four would have been sufficient for our purposes."</p>\n<p><em>Desist v.

The problem is not merely the appearance of inequity, but the actual inequity that results when the Court chooses which of many similarly situated defendants should be the chance beneficiary of a retroactively applied rule.  As the persistently voiced dissatisfaction with the Court\'s "ambulatory retroactivity doctrine" has revealed, <em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra,</em> until now, this Court has not "resolved" this problem so much as it has chosen to tolerate it.  The time for toleration has come to an end.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>We are aware, of course, that many considerations affect a defendant\'s progress through the judicial system, and that the speed of appellate review will differ from State to State, Circuit to Circuit, and case to case.  Even under our approach, it may be unavoidable that some similarly situated defendants will be treated differently.  <em>Cf. Williams v.

The Government concedes that the <em>Payton</em> rule should apply to any pre-<em>Payton</em> case arising in a Circuit where the United States Court of Appeals already had held authoritatively that <em>Payton</em>-type searches were unlawful.  Brief for United States 22-26.  When respondent was arrested, two Courts of Appeals had invalidated warrantless home arrests conducted in the absence of exigent circumstances.  <em>See Dorman v. United States,</em> 140 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 435 F.2d 385 (1970); <em>United States v. Shye,</em> 492 F.2d 886 (CA6 1974).  Thus, under the Government\'s theory, the statements of a suspect arrested in the District of Columbia, on the same day as respondent was arrested in Los Angeles and under identical circumstances, should be excluded while respondent\'s statements should not.  Moreover, under the Government\'s reasoning, this Court would be obliged to reverse a ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit excluding those statements, but not an identical ruling from the District of Columbia Circuit in a parallel case.</p>\n<p>The dissent takes a different tack.  Arguing that "inherent arbitrariness" arises whenever lines are drawn in this area, the dissent suggests that the "best way to deal with this problem" is to continue to make retroactivity decisions by picking and choosing from among similarly situated defendants.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#568">457 U. S. 568</a></span>.  By clinging to this view, the dissent, and not the Court, "is fooling itself."  <em>Ibid.</em>  This Court has no power to speed up or slow down the appellate process in the many tribunals throughout the country to ensure similar treatment of similarly situated defendants.  The Court does, however, have the power to eliminate the obvious unfairness that results when it gives only the most conveniently situated defendant the retrospective benefit of a newly declared rule.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent shares this mistaken impression.  In support of its claim, the dissent cites <em>Peltier\'s</em> suggestion that every decision by this Court involving the exclusionary rule has been "accorded only prospective application."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#564">457 U.

As <em>Peltier</em> recognized with discomfort, however, <em>Linkletter</em> itself -- the first of the modern retroactivity cases -- acknowledged the application of the <em>Mapp</em> exclusionary rule to cases that were pending on direct review at the time that <em>Mapp</em> was decided.  <em>See</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#535">422 U.

North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html">432 U. S. 233</a></span> (1977); <em>Ivan V. v.

Depending on the constitutional provision involved, additional factors may warrant giving a particular ruling retroactive effect beyond those cases pending on direct review.  <em>See Hankerson v. North Carolina,</em> 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html#248">432 U.

S. 568</a></span>.  The dissent then recasts those precedents in its own simplistic way, arguing that rules related to truthfinding automatically receive full retroactive effect, while implying that all other rules -- including Fourth Amendment rules -- should receive none.</p>\n<p>There are, however, two problems with this.  First, the Court\'s decisions regularly giving complete retroactive effect to truthfinding rules have in no way required that newly declared Fourth Amendment rulings be denied all retroactive effect.  For the reasons already stated, retroactive application of Fourth Amendment rules at least to cases pending on direct review furthers the policies underlying the exclusionary rule.  Second, and more important, the Fourth Amendment "rule" urged by the dissent is far from a "perfectly good" one.  <em>Ibid.</em>  As we already have shown, that "rule" condones obviously inequitable treatment of similarly situated litigants and judicial injustice to individual litigants.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The question on which we granted certiorari encompassed one other issue:  whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that its own decision in <em>United States v. Prescott,</em> 581 F.2d 1343 (1978), applies retroactively to respondent\'s arrest.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  Because we hold that the principles of our decision in <em>Payton</em> apply retroactively to respondent\'s case, we need not disturb the Court of Appeals\' ruling regarding the retroactive application of its own prior decision.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion on my understanding that the decision leaves undisturbed our retroactivity precedents as applied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 457 U. S. 564</a></p><p> to convictions final at the time of decision.  <em>See Stovall v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html">388 U. S. 293</a></span> (1967).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O\'CONNOR join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In my view, this case is controlled by <em>United States v. Peltier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html">422 U. S. 531</a></span> (1975).  <em>Peltier</em> established two propositions.  First, retroactive application of a new constitutional doctrine is appropriate when that doctrine\'s major purpose is</p>\n<p>"\'to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truthfinding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#535">422 U. S. 535</a></span>, quoting <em>Williams v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html">401 U.

Second, new extensions of the exclusionary rule do not serve this purpose and, therefore, will not generally be applied retroactively.  There was surely nothing extraordinary about our ruling in <em>Payton v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/573/case.html">445 U. S. 573</a></span> (1980), that would justify an exception to this general rule.</p>\n<p><em>Peltier</em> was only the latest of a number of cases involving the question of whether rulings extending the reach of the exclusionary rule should be given retroactive effect.  We noted there that,</p>\n<p>"in every case in which the Court has addressed the retroactivity problem in the context of the exclusionary rule . . . , the Court has concluded that any such new constitutional principle would be accorded only prospective application."</p>\n<p>422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#535">422 U. S. 535</a></span>.  We suggested that there were two reasons for this consistent pattern of decisions, and that these two reasons were directly related to the justifications for the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p>That rule has traditionally been understood to serve two purposes:  first, it preserves "judicial integrity"; second, it acts as a deterrent to unconstitutional police conduct.  Neither of these purposes, however, is furthered by retroactive application of new extensions of the rule.  First,</p>\n<p>"if the law enforcement officers reasonably believed in good faith that evidence they had seized was admissible at trial, the \'imperative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 457 U. S. 565</a></p><p> of judicial integrity\' is not offended by the introduction into evidence of that material."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#537">422 U. S. 537</a></span>.  Second, a deterrence purpose can only be served when the evidence to be suppressed is derived from a search which the law enforcement officers knew or should have known was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#542">422 U. S. 542</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In focusing on the purpose of the exclusionary rule in order to decide the question of retroactivity, the Court was following settled principles.  In <em>Linkletter v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html">381 U. S. 618</a></span> (1965), which the majority agrees is the first of the modern retroactivity cases, the Court set forth a three-pronged model for analysis of the retroactivity question presented there:</p>\n<p>"[W]e must look to the purpose of the <em>Mapp</em> rule; the reliance placed upon the <em>Wolf</em> doctrine; and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Mapp.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/case.html#636">381 U. S. 636</a></span>.  This three-prong analysis was consistently applied in the cases which followed, <em>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html">382 U. S. 406</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html#419">382 U. S. 419</a></span> (1966); <em>Johnson v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html">384 U. S. 719</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html#727">384 U. S. 727</a></span> (1966); <em>Stovall v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html">388 U. S. 293</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html#297">388 U. S. 297</a></span> (1967).  Indeed, in <em>Stovall,</em> the Court specifically announced that these three considerations -- purpose of the new rule, reliance on the old rule, and effect on the administration of justice -- were generally to guide resolution of all retroactivity problems relating to constitutional rules of criminal procedure.  In each of these cases, the purpose of the new rule was the first consideration.  That this was not accidental was made absolutely clear in <em>Desist v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html">394 U. S. 244</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#249">394 U. S. 249</a></span> (1969):  "Foremost among these factors is the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule." <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html">*</a></span>  And as we went on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 457 U. S. 566</a></p><p> to say there, "[t]his criterion strongly supports prospectivity for a decision amplifying the evidentiary exclusionary rule."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Moreover, up until today\'s decision, it was clear that these same principles governed the question of whether a new decision should retroactively apply to cases pending on appeal at the time of its announcement.  <em>Peltier</em> itself was just this sort of a case:  Peltier\'s case was on appeal at the time of the announcement of the decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html">413 U. S. 266</a></span> (1973).  Indeed, we reversed the Court of Appeals\' holding in that case that the</p>\n<p>"rule announced . . . in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States</em> . . . should be applied to similar cases pending on appeal on the date the Supreme Court\'s decision was announced."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Peltier,</em> 500 F.2d 985, 986 (CA9 1974) (footnote omitted).  I had thought that we long ago resolved the problem of the appearance of inequity that arises whenever we limit the retroactive reach of a new principle of law.  As JUSTICE BRENNAN stated for the Court in <em>Stovall, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/case.html#301">388 U. S. 301</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"Inequity arguably results from according the benefit of a new rule to the parties in the case in which it is announced, but not to other litigants similarly situated in the trial or appellate process who have raised the same issue.  But we regard the fact that the parties involved are chance beneficiaries as an insignificant cost for adherence to sound principles of decisionmaking."</p>\n<p>All of these principles are well settled, and require reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The majority, in an intricate and confusing opinion disagrees.  Two reasons for its disagreement seem to be presented.</p>\n<p>First, the majority discerns no consistent reading of our precedents that would control this case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#554">457 U. S. 554</a></span> ("Having determined that the retroactivity question here is not clearly controlled by our prior precedents . . .").  Given the clarity with which we have previously set out the applicable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 457 U. S. 567</a></p><p> principles and the consistent application of those principles in cases involving extensions of the exclusionary rule, this is surely a strange conclusion.  Eschewing the straightforward reading of the cases set forth above, which looks primarily to the substantive purpose of the relevant rule of law, the majority replaces it with an exceedingly formal set of three categories.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#549">457 U. S. 549</a></span>-551.  Because these categories turn out to be dicta only, they merit little comment.  Suffice it to say that their inadequacy is obvious from even a moment\'s reflection:  that category to which the majority agrees "the Court has regularly given complete retroactive effect" is nowhere included in this formal scheme -- cases announcing new constitutional rules whose major purpose</p>\n<p>"\'is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truthfinding function, and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#544">457 U. S. 544</a></span>, quoting <em>Williams v. United States,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/case.html#653">401 U. S. 653</a></span> (plurality opinion).  It is little wonder that the majority finds this case difficult, when it has failed to learn the most obvious lessons of the previous cases.</p>\n<p>Second, the majority seems to think that the problems of principle that Justice Harlan struggled with in his dissent in <em>Desist v. United States, supra,</em> are unanswerable under any rule that fails to give the benefits of a new constitutional ruling to all criminal defendants whose cases are pending on appeal at the time of the announcement.  These problems are not new. and were, I believe, adequately answered by JUSTICE BRENNAN in <em>Stovall.</em>  The majority\'s approach, however, does not resolve these theoretical problems; it simply draws what is necessarily an arbitrary line in a somewhat different place than the Court had previously settled upon.  Anything less than full retroactivity will necessarily appear unjust in some instances; it will provide different treatment to similarly situated individuals.  The majority recognizes that the vagaries of the appellate process will cause this same problem to reappear under its proposed rule:  "Even under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 457 U. S. 568</a></p><p> our approach, it may be unavoidable that some similarly situated defendants will be treated differently."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#556">457 U. S. 556</a></span>-557, n. 17.  We had previously held that the best way to deal with this problem of inherent arbitrariness was to abide by the substantive principles outlined in <em>Stovall.</em>  The majority makes no better suggestion today, and is fooling itself if it believes that its proposal is a reasoned response to this problem of arbitrariness, rather than an exercise in line-drawing.</p>\n<p>The insubstantiality of the majority\'s analysis and proposal is well illustrated by its conclusion.  Despite the appearance of having resolved the difficult problem of the apparent injustice of any rule of partial retroactivity, the Court announces at the end that its decision today applies only to decisions "construing the Fourth Amendment," and asserts that it is not disturbing any of our retroactivity precedents.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#562">457 U. S. 562</a></span>.  That is, it returns from its abstract procedural approach to the substantive rule of law at issue.  There are two problems with this, however.  First, there is no connection between the analysis and the conclusion.  Second, and more important, we already had a perfectly good rule for resolving retroactivity problems involving the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p>* <em>See also</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html#251">394 U.
