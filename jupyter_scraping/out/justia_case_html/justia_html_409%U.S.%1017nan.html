After leaving petitioner, Lynette went to live with her sister and brother-in-law, Lana and Larry Sanders, in Collinsville. At approximately 8 p. m. on February 2, 1971, petitioner went to the Sanders\' residence, displayed a gun, and informed Gary Hany, another occupant, that he intended to take Lynette with him. After a wait of approximately 45 minutes, Lynette, Lana, and Larry arrived at the residence. Petitioner told Lynette that if she refused to go with him he would kill them all. Lynette became \'kind of shook up\' and agreed to go. Petitioner then </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1018">Page 409 U.S. 1017 , 1018</a></p><p> took Larry Sanders\' money (three dollars) and car keys, and left with Lynette in the Sanders\' car. After an extensive chase, petitioner was apprehended by the Oklahoma police and was charged with kidnaping, two counts of armed robbery, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.* </p><p> Although all of these charges arose out of the \'same transaction or occurrence,\' they were prosecuted by the State in two separate proceedings. At the first trial, petitioner was convicted of the armed robbery of Larry Sanders. At the second trial, he was convicted of kidnaping Lynette Murphy, and was acquitted of a charge of armed robbery of Lana Sanders. Petitioner\'s contention that this second prosecution was barred by the provisions against double jeopardy in both the state and federal constitutions was rejected by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, one judge dissenting. Grubb v. State, Okl.Cr., 497 P.2d 1305 (1972). </p><p> I would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.
