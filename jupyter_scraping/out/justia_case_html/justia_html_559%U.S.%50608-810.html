Respondents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were later rehired.  To account for the past distributions when calculating respondents\xe2\x80\x99 current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d method.  Respondents challenged that method in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded.  It held that the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was unreasonable and that respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom account method would be used to calculate their benefits.  On remand, the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had previously received.  The District Court declined to apply a deferential standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of money.  Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on remand, and that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the merits was not an abuse of discretion.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of review to the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Plan on remand.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions of ERISA plan administrators in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a>.  <em>Firestone</em> looked to \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of trust law\xe2\x80\x9d for guidance.  <em>Id.</em>, at 111.  Under trust law, the appropriate standard depends on the language of the instrument creating the trust.  When a trust instrument gives the trustee \xe2\x80\x9cpower to construe disputed or doubtful terms, \xe2\x80\xa6 the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under <em>Firestone</em> and the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, the Plan Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when interpreting the Plan.  The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an exception to <em>Firestone</em> deference, holding that a court need not apply a deferential standard when a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s previous construction of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cone-strike-and-you\xe2\x80\x99re-out\xe2\x80\x9d approach has no basis in <em>Firestone</em>, which set out a broad standard of deference with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions.  This Court held in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Glenn</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___, that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of interest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review.  In light of that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should require a different result.  Nor is the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision supported by the considerations on which <em>Firestone </em>and <em>Glenn</em> were based\xe2\x80\x94the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive authority without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to construe the Plan.  An exception to <em>Firestone </em>deference is also not required by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA but do not \xe2\x80\x9ctell the entire story.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 497.  Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts may strip a plan administrator of <em>Firestone</em> deference after one good-faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ERISA represents a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98careful balancing\xe2\x80\x99 between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Health Inc.</em> v. <em>Davila</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/200/index.html">542 U. S. 200</a>, 215.  <em>Firestone</em> deference preserves this \xe2\x80\x9ccareful balancing\xe2\x80\x9d and protects the statute\xe2\x80\x99s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity.  Respondents claim that deference is less important once a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not suddenly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illustrated by this case.  When the District Court declined to apply a deferential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more complicated than necessary.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 approach threatens to interject additional issues into ERISA litigation that \xe2\x80\x9cwould create further complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may already be too costly for many [seeking] redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Glenn, supra</em>, at ___.  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniformity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of <em>Firestone</em> deference.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not account for the time value of money, but respondents\xe2\x80\x99 own actuarial expert testified that fairness required recognizing that principle.  Respondents do not dispute that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach would place them in a better position than employees who never left the company.  If other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations in different States.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unreasonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit disputes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from challenging administrators\xe2\x80\x99 decisions.  These concerns are overblown because there is no reason to think that deference would be required in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee.  Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of costly litigation that respondents fear.  Applying a deferential standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator will always prevail on the merits.  It means only that the plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firestone</em>, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA plans.  That should come as no surprise, given that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is \xe2\x80\x9can enormously complex and detailed statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html">508 U. S. 248</a>, 262 (1993), and the plans that administrators must construe can be lengthy and complicated.  (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with 139 sections.)  We held in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a> (1989), that an ERISA plan administrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is entitled to deference in exercising that discretion.  The question here is whether a single honest mistake in plan interpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that deference for subsequent related interpretations of the plan.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are exceedingly complicated.  Fortunately, most of the factual details are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we cover them only in broad strokes.  This case concerns Xerox Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s pension plan, which is covered by ERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 <em>et seq.</em>  Petitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s current and former administrators (hereinafter Plan Administrator).  See \xc2\xa71002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a.  Respondents are Xerox employees who left the company in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement benefits they had earned up to that point, and were later rehired.  See 328 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief for Respondents 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  The dispute giving rise to this case concerns how to account for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 past distributions when calculating their current benefits\xe2\x80\x94that is, how to avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d method.  328 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 424.  Essentially, that method calculated the hypothetical growth that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 past distributions would have experienced if the money had remained in Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s investment funds, and reduced respondents\xe2\x80\x99 present benefits accordingly.  See <em>id.</em>, at 426\xe2\x80\x93428; App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a.  After the Plan Administrator denied respondents\xe2\x80\x99 administrative challenges to that method, respondents filed suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  See 328 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 428\xe2\x80\x93429.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan, applying a deferential standard of review to the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 430\xe2\x80\x93431, 439.  The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was unreasonable and that respondents had not been adequately notified that the phantom account method would be used to calculate their benefits.  See 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 254, 257, 265\xe2\x80\x93269 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phantom account method having been exorcised from the Plan, the District Court on remand considered other approaches for adjusting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 present benefits in light of their past distributions.  See 472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 452, 456\xe2\x80\x93458 (WDNY 2007).  The Plan Administrator submitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like the phantom account method, accounted for the time value of the money that respondents had previously received.  But unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s new approach did not calculate the present value of a past distribution based on events that occurred after the distribution was made.  Instead, the new approach used an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the distribution, thereby calculating the current value of the distribution based on information that was known at the time of the distribution.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a\xe2\x80\x93153a.  Petitioners argued that the District Court should apply a deferential standard of review to this approach, and accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.  See Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies in No. 00\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x936311 (WDNY), pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938; Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Pre-Hearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x936311 (WDNY), p.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court did not apply a deferential standard of review.  Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Instead, after finding the Plan to be ambiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of money.  Under that approach, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 present benefits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past distributions\xe2\x80\x94thereby treating a dollar distributed to respondents in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s as equal in value to a dollar distributed today.  See 472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 457\xe2\x80\x93458.  The Second Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on remand, and that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the merits was not an abuse of discretion.  See 535 F.\xc2\xa03d 111, 119 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two questions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Plan on remand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly granted deference to the District Court on the merits.  Pet. for Cert. i.  We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions of ERISA plan administrators in <em>Firestone,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a>.  Because ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s text does not directly resolve the matter, we looked to \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of trust law\xe2\x80\x9d for guidance.  <em>Id.</em>, at 109, 111.  We recognized that, under trust law, the proper standard of review of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s decision depends on the language of the instrument creating the trust.  See <em>id.</em>, at 111\xe2\x80\x93112.  If the trust documents give the trustee \xe2\x80\x9cpower to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . . the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 111.  Based on these considerations, we held that \xe2\x80\x9ca denial of benefits challenged under \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <em>de novo</em> standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 115.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We expanded <em>Firestone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Glenn</em>, 554 U. S. ___ (2008).  In determining the proper standard of review when a plan administrator operates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to trust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles of ERISA\xe2\x80\x94plus, of course, our precedent in <em>Firestone</em>.  See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6\xe2\x80\x937, 9\xe2\x80\x9310).  We held that, when the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to the plan administrator, a deferential standard of review remains appropriate even in the face of a conflict.  See <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that, under <em>Firestone</em> and the terms of the Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when interpreting the Plan.  See 328 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 430\xe2\x80\x93431 (observing that the Plan grants the Plan Administrator \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion in making decisions relative to the Plan\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an exception to <em>Firestone</em> deference.  Specifically, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a deferential standard \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the administrator ha[s] previously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such a construction to have violated ERISA.\xe2\x80\x9d  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 119.  Under that view, the District Court here was entitled to reject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by the Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Appeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.  Cf. <em>ibid. </em>(accepting the District\nCourt\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method as one of \xe2\x80\x9cseveral reasonable\nalternatives\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject this \xe2\x80\x9cone-strike-and-you\xe2\x80\x99re-out\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  Brief for Petitioners 51.  As an initial matter, it has no basis in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Firestone</em>, which set out a broad standard of deference without any suggestion that the standard was susceptible to ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions like the one adopted by the Court of Appeals.  See 489 U. S., at 111, 115.  Indeed, we refused to create such an exception to <em>Firestone</em> deference in <em>Glenn</em>, recognizing that ERISA law was already complicated enough without adding \xe2\x80\x9cspecial procedural or evidentiary rules\xe2\x80\x9d to the mix.  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  If, as we held in <em>Glenn</em>, a systemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan administrator of deference, see <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake would require a different result.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision supported by the considerations on which our holdings in <em>Firestone </em>and <em>Glenn</em> were based\xe2\x80\x94namely, the terms of the plan, principles of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator general authority to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onstrue the Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a\xe2\x80\x93142a.  Nothing in that provision suggests that the grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe the Plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 exception to <em>Firestone </em>deference is not required by principles of trust law.  Trust law is unclear on the narrow question before us.  A leading treatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his discretion when there is reason to believe that he will not exercise that discretion fairly\xe2\x80\x94for example, upon a showing that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exercise [the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion honestly and fairly, the court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself.  On the other hand, if the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide reasonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties or powers, and there is no reason to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the discretion once the court has determined the extent of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties and powers, the court ordinarily will not fix the amount but will instead direct the trustee to make reasonable provision for the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts \xc2\xa718.2.1, pp. 1348\xe2\x80\x931349 (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote omitted) (citing cases).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis is not surprising\xe2\x80\x94if the settlor who creates a trust grants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the settlor would want the trustee divested entirely of that discretion simply because of one good-faith mistake.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the lower courts made no finding that the Plan Administrator had acted in bad faith or would not fairly exercise his discretion to interpret the terms of the Plan.  Thus, if the District Court had followed the trust law principles set out in Scott and Ascher, it should not have \xe2\x80\x9cact[ed] as a substitute trustee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Eaton</em> v. <em>Eaton</em>, 82 N.\xc2\xa0H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926), and stripped the Plan Administrator of the deference he would otherwise enjoy under <em>Firestone</em> and the terms of the Plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other trust law sources, however, point the other way.  For example, the Restatement (Second) of Trusts states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court will control the trustee in the exercise of a power where he acts beyond the bounds of a reasonable judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>i</em>, p. 406 (1957).  Another treatise states that, after a trustee has abused his discretion, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ometimes the court decides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating the exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some limits on the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s action and giving him leeway within those limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  G. Bogert &amp; G.

On the other hand, there is authority for remanding the case to the trial court to hear evidence and in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction to fix the amount of such payments.  There is still other authority for remanding the case to the trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee within maximum and minimum limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Rubion</em>, 158 Tex. 43, 54\xe2\x80\x9355, 308 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 4, 11 (1957) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While we are \xe2\x80\x9cguided by principles of trust law\xe2\x80\x9d in ERISA cases, <em>Firestone</em>, 489 U. S., at 111, we have recognized before that \xe2\x80\x9ctrust law does not tell the entire story,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 497 (1996); see <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cIn some instances, trust law will offer only a starting point, after which courts must go on to ask whether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its structure, or its purposes require departing from common-law trust requirements\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Respondents 50 (pressing same view as the dissent but concluding that the dispute over trust law \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be resolved\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here trust law does not resolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding principles we have identified underlying ERISA do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees would receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress did not require employers to establish benefit plans in the first place.  <em>Lockheed Corp.</em> v. <em>Spink</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/882/index.html">517 U. S. 882</a>, 887 (1996).  We have therefore recognized that ERISA represents a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98careful balancing\xe2\x80\x99 between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Health Inc.</em> v. <em>Davila</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/200/index.html">542 U. S. 200</a>, 215 (2004) (quoting <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Dedeaux</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/index.html">481 U. S. 41</a>, 54 (1987)).  Congress sought \xe2\x80\x9cto create a system that is [not] so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Varity Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 497.  ERISA \xe2\x80\x9cinduc[es] employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and awards when a violation has occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moran</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/index.html">536 U. S. 355</a>, 379 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Firestone</em> deference protects these interests and, by permitting an employer to grant primary interpretive authority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator, preserves the \xe2\x80\x9ccareful balancing\xe2\x80\x9d on which ERISA is based.  Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging resolution of benefits disputes through internal administrative proceedings rather than costly litigation.  It also promotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the expertise of the plan administrator rather than worry about unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that might result from <em>de novo</em> judicial review.  Moreover, <em>Firestone</em> deference serves the interest of uniformity, helping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of a plan, like the one here, that covers employees in different jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94a result that \xe2\x80\x9cwould introduce considerable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which might lead those employers with existing plans to reduce benefits, and those without such plans to refrain from adopting them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Coyne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/index.html">482 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (1987).  Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries tells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an ERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by federal law, see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is interpreted to mean different things in different places.  See Brief for Chief Actuaries as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents and the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> do not question that deference to plan administrators serves these important purposes.  Rather, they argue that deference is less important once a plan administrator has issued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.  But the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity\xe2\x80\x94and the manner in which they are promoted by deference to reasonable plan construction by administrators\xe2\x80\x94do not suddenly disappear simply because a plan administrator has made a single honest mistake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case illustrates the point.  Consider first the interest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by granting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the Plan.  On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the District Court had applied a deferential standard of review under <em>Firestone</em>, the question before it would have been whether the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Plan was reasonable.  After answering that question, the case might well have been over.  Instead, the District Court declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the more complicated question of how best to interpret the Plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 approach does not end there.  Under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, the question whether a deferential standard of review was required in this case turns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting the \xe2\x80\x9csame terms\xe2\x80\x9d or deciding the \xe2\x80\x9csame issue\xe2\x80\x9d on remand.  See Brief for Respondents 43, 46\xe2\x80\x9348, 53, and n. 13; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9315, 23.  Whether that condition is satisfied will not always be clear.  Indeed, petitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the Plan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on remand\xe2\x80\x94how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific provisions requiring use of the phantom account method could not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.  See Brief for Petitioners 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  Respondents would force the parties to litigate this potentially complicated \xe2\x80\x9csame issue\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csame terms\xe2\x80\x9d question before a district court could even decide whether deference is owed to a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s view.  As we recognized in <em>Glenn</em>, there is little place in the ERISA context for these sorts of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial procedural rules [that] would create further complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may already be too costly for many of those who seek redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The position of respondents and the Government could interject other additional issues into ERISA litigation.  For example, even under their view, the District Court here <em>could</em> have granted deference to the Plan Administrator; the court merely was not <em>required </em>to do so.  See Brief for Respondents 43, 49\xe2\x80\x9350, 52\xe2\x80\x9353; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  That raises the question of how a court is to decide between the two options; respondents\xe2\x80\x99 answer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors, which would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in predictability that would result from stripping a plan administrator of <em>Firestone</em> deference.  After declining to apply a deferential standard here, the District Court adopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not account for the time value of money.  472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 458; 535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 119.  In the actuarial world, this is heresy, and highly unforeseeable.  Indeed, the actuaries tell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan resembling this one that did not include some adjustment for the time value of money.  Brief for Chief Actuaries as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 own actuarial expert testified before the District Court that fairness would require recognizing the time value of money in some fashion.  See App. 127a, 130a.  And respondents and the Government do not dispute that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which does not account for the fact that respondents were able to use their past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years, would place respondents in a better position than employees who never left the company.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 42\xe2\x80\x9343; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  Deference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all beneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see <em>Varity Corp.</em>, 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for particular employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems that arise from creating ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions to <em>Firestone </em>deference.  If other courts were to adopt an interpretation of the Plan that does account for the time value of money, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation.  Similar Xerox employees could be entitled to different benefits depending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring a legal action.  Cf. 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(e)(2) (permitting suit \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the plan is administered, where the breach took place, or where a defendant resides or may be found\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, that may already be the case.  In similar litigation over the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of the phantom account method, but held that the Plan Administrator should utilize actuarial principles in accounting for rehired employees\xe2\x80\x99 past distributions\xe2\x80\x94which would presumably include taking some cognizance of the time value of money.  See <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Xerox Corp. Retirement Income Guarantee Plan</em>, 464 F.\xc2\xa03d 871, 875\xe2\x80\x93876 (2006); Brief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Benefits Council as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Thus, failing to defer to the Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to be subject to different interpretations in California and New York.  \xe2\x80\x9cUniformity is impossible, however, if plans are subject to different legal obligations in different States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Egelhoff</em> v. <em>Egelhoff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/141/index.html">532 U. S. 141</a>, 148 (2001).  <em>Firestone</em> deference serves to avoid that result and to preserve the \xe2\x80\x9ccareful balancing\xe2\x80\x9d of interests that ERISA represents.  <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co.</em>, 481 U. S., at 54.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In spite of all this, respondents and the Government argue that requiring the District Court to apply <em>Firestone</em> deference in this case would actually disserve the purposes of ERISA.  They argue that continued deference would encourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable interpretations of plans in the first instance, as administrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their plans if their first interpretations were rejected.  And they argue that plan administrators would be able to proceed seriatim through several interpretations of their plans, each time receiving deference, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from challenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All this is overblown.  There is no reason to think that deference would be required in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee.  Under trust law, a trustee may be stripped of deference when he does not exercise his discretion \xe2\x80\x9chonestly and fairly.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Scott and Ascher 1348.  Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in good faith, might well support a finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of costly litigation that respondents fear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean that the plan administrator will prevail on the merits.  It means only that the plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the plan \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Firestone</em>, 489 U. S., at 111; see also <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Where discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise is not subject to control by the court except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187)).  Thus, far from \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible requirement\xe2\x80\x9d that courts must defer to plan administrators, <em>post</em>, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should have applied the standard established in <em>Firestone</em> and <em>Glenn</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District Court could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the Court of Appeals had found a previous related interpretation by the Administrator to be invalid.  Because we reverse on that ground, we do not reach the question whether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a deferential standard of review to the decision of the District Court on the merits.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent is wrong to suggest a lack of case support for this interpretation of trust law.  <em>Post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Breyer, J.).

To explain my view, I shall describe the three significant mistakes involved in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s pension plan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan Administrator), petitioners here.  The Plan, as I understand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon retirement.  App. 29a\xe2\x80\x9331a.  These benefits are calculated as follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of the Plan):</p>\n<p align="left">(1) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pension\xe2\x80\x9d:  Take your average salary for your five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 percent; and multiply again by the number of years you worked at Xerox (up to 30).  <em>Id.,</em> at 7a\xe2\x80\x9311a, 29a\xe2\x80\x9330a.  Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30 years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per year ($50,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.4 percent\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa030).</p>\n<p>\n\n(2) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cash Account\xe2\x80\x9d:  Every year, Xerox credits 5 percent of your salary to a cash account.  <em>Id.</em>, at 40a.  This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1 percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 41a.  To determine your benefits under this approach, take the balance of your cash account and convert the final amount to an annuity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 31a.  Thus, if you have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approximately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (approximately $200,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07 percent).</p>\n<p>\n\n(3) \xe2\x80\x9cThe Investment Account\xe2\x80\x9d:  Before 1990, Xerox contributed to an employee profit sharing plan.  <em>Id.,</em> at 33a\xe2\x80\x9334a.  Thus, all employees who were hired by the end of 1989 have an investment account that consists of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the investment returns on those contributions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 33a\xe2\x80\x9336a.  To determine your benefits under this approach, take the balance of your investment account and convert the final amount to an annuity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 31a.  Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000 per year upon your retirement (approximately $400,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07 percent).</p>\n<p align="left">\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee\xe2\x80\x99s pension would come from the investment account, and the employee would receive $28,000 per year.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns one aspect of Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s retirement plan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees who leave Xerox and later return, working for additional years before their ultimate retirement.  The Plan has long treated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows (again, I simplify and use my own words):</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a lump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has accrued up to that point (<em>i.e.</em>, the highest of her pension, her cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of 1989, her investment account).  See <em>ante, </em>at 2<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to accrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a\xe2\x80\x9341a, starting from scratch.  (She accrues nothing in her investment account, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing contributions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 34a.)  Thus, by the time of her retirement the employee may not have accrued much money in this account.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a rehired employee\xe2\x80\x99s pension is calculated in the way I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox (both before her departure and after her return) taken into account.  See Brief for Petitioners 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s benefits calculation is adjusted to take account of the fact that the employee has already received a lump-sum distribution from the Plan.  See App. 32a; Brief for Petitioners 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is about the adjustment that takes place during step four.  It concerns the way in which the Plan Administrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the fact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has already received a distribution when she initially left Xerox.  Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the adjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the amount that would have existed in the investment account had no distribution been made.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Thus, if an employee had not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her investment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would likely have increased dramatically\xe2\x80\x94perhaps doubling, tripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how well the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s investments performed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is this <em>hypothetical </em>sum\xe2\x80\x94termed the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 2\xe2\x80\x94that is at issue in this case.  Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this hypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retirement from the company, and in effect subtracted the amount from the employee\xe2\x80\x99s benefits upon her departure.  Brief for Petitioners 10\xe2\x80\x9311; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 2.  Depending on how the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s investments did over time, the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s use of this \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d could have a substantial impact on a rehired employee\xe2\x80\x99s benefits.  (See Appendix, <em>infra</em>, for an example of how this \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d works.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) Plan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an \xe2\x80\x9cinadverten[t]\xe2\x80\x9d omission.  Brief for Petitioners 11, n.\xc2\xa03.  In a section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100 leaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here, the Plan said that it would \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d the retiring employees\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9caccrued benefit\xe2\x80\x9d (as ordinarily calculated) \xe2\x80\x9cby the accrued benefit attributable\xe2\x80\x9d to the prior lump-sum \xe2\x80\x9cdistribution\xe2\x80\x9d those employees received when they initially left Xerox.  App. 32a.  <em>But the Plan said nothing about how it would calculate this \xe2\x80\x9coffset.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>In other words, the Plan said nothing about the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s use of the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This led to the first mistake in this case.  Despite the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s failure to include language explaining how the Administrator would take into account an employee\xe2\x80\x99s prior distribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d methodology.  In essence, the Administrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language that had been omitted\xe2\x80\x94an interpretation that, as described below, see Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>, the Court of Appeals found to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of ERISA.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court committed the second mistake in this case.  In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who left and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.  <em>Ante, </em>at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii\xe2\x80\x93iii, 12.  They pointed out that the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their retirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already received a lump-sum benefits distribution when they initially left Xerox.  But, they added, neither the 1989 Plan, nor the 1989 Plan\xe2\x80\x99s Summary Plan Description, said anything about whether (or how) the Administrator would adjust their previous benefits distribution to take into account that they had received the distribution well before their retirement.  They thus claimed that the Plan Administrator could not use the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d methodology to adjust their previous distributions.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, however, rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  328 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 420 (WDNY 2004).  The court accepted the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the 1989 Plan implicitly incorporated the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d approach that had previously been part of Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s retirement plan.  <em>Id.,</em> at 433\xe2\x80\x93434.  And the court thus held in favor of petitioners\xe2\x80\x94thereby committing the second mistake in this case.  <em>Id.,</em> at 439.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the District Court and vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in relevant part.  433 F.\xc2\xa03d 254 (2006).  The Court of Appeals concluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about how the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits distributions, it was \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious\xe2\x80\x9d for the Administrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still incorporated the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 265\xe2\x80\x93266, and n.\xc2\xa011.  And the Court of Appeals thus held that the language of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at the least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents with fair notice that the Administrator was going to use the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  See <em>id.,</em> at 265 (discussing 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71022); see also 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 263, 267\xe2\x80\x93268 (holding that the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to apply the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d to respondents violated two other ERISA provisions: 29  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71054(h)\xe2\x80\x99s notice requirement and \xc2\xa71054(g)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on retroactive benefit cutbacks).  Rather, the court noted, respondents \xe2\x80\x9clikely believed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94based on the language of the Plan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat their past distributions would only be factored into their [current] benefits calculations by taking into account the amounts they had actually received.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 267.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals recognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations\xe2\x80\x94a remedy that took into account the previous benefits distributions respondents had received in a manner consistent with the 1989 Plan.  The court therefore remanded the case to the District Court, with the following instructions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cOn remand, the remedy crafted by the district court for those employees [in the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 situation] should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calculation to determine their benefits.  We recognize the difficulty that this task poses . . . .  As guidance for the district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ equitable principles when determining the appropriate calculation and fashioning the appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 268.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the District Court invited the parties to submit remedial recommendations.  Brief for Petitioners 14.  The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that would adjust respondents\xe2\x80\x99 previous benefits distributions by adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator suggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new hires.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The District Court rejected these suggestions and concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d remedy was the one suggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the prior distributions received by respondents.  472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007).  The court stated that this remedy was \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward; it adequately prevent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it most clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would have anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in the Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the Court of Appeals, finding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a remedy, affirmed.  535 F.\xc2\xa03d 111 (CA2 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third mistake, I believe, is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  As the majority recognizes, <em>ante</em>, at 4, \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples of trust law\xe2\x80\x9d guide this Court in \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining the appropriate standard\xe2\x80\x9d by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan administrator.  <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U.

S. 559</a>, 570 (1985).  And, as the majority also recognizes, <em>ante,</em> at 4, where an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discretionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law <em>requires</em> a court to defer to the plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of plan terms.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Glenn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ____ (slip op., at 4).  But the majority further concludes that trust law \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not resolve the specific issue before\xe2\x80\x9d the Court in this case\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether a court is <em>required</em> to defer to an administrator\xe2\x80\x99s <em>second attempt </em>at interpreting plan documents<em>, </em>even after the court has already determined that the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt amounted to an abuse of discretion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  In my view, this final conclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid and inflexible requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit found the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of ERISA, and it made clear that<em> </em>the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s task on remand was to \xe2\x80\x9ccraf[t]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cremedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 268.  Trust law treatise writers say that in these circumstances a court <em>may </em>(but need not) exercise its own discretion rather than defer to a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of trust language.  See G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \xc2\xa7560, pp. 222\xe2\x80\x93223 (2d rev. ed. 1980) (hereinafter Bogert &amp; Bogert) (after finding an abuse of discretion, a court may \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[e] for the trustee how he should act,\xe2\x80\x9d possibly by \xe2\x80\x9cstating the exact result\xe2\x80\x9d the court \xe2\x80\x9cdesires to achieve\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of Trusts \xc2\xa750, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement) (\xe2\x80\x9cA discretionary power conferred upon the trustee \xe2\x80\xa6 is subject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpretation or abuse of the discretion by the trustee\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, p.\xc2\xa0402 (1957) (hereinafter Second Restatement) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere discretion is conferred upon the trustee \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, its exercise is not subject to control by the court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 111.  Judges deciding trust law cases have said the same.  See, <em>e.g., Colton</em> v. <em>Colton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/127/300/index.html">127 U. S. 300</a>, 322 (1888) (stating that it was the \xe2\x80\x9cduty of the court\xe2\x80\x9d to determine the trust payments due after rejecting the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation); <em>State</em> v. <em>Rubion</em>, 158 Tex. 43, 55, 308 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 4, 11 (1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cConsidering that we have held that there has already been an abuse of discretion by the trustee \xe2\x80\xa6 , we have concluded that a remand of the case to the trial court for the definite establishment of amounts to be paid will better promote a speedy administration of justice and a final termination of this litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Glenn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ____ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (court may exercise discretion under trust law when a \xe2\x80\x9ctrustee had discretion but abused it\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, the controlling trust law principle appears to be that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the court finds that there has been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to be rendered is in its discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bogert &amp; Bogert \xc2\xa7560, at 222.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discretion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion in all instances.  The majority refers to the 2007 edition of Scott on Trusts, <em>ante</em>, at 6, which says that, if there is \xe2\x80\x9cno reason\xe2\x80\x9d to doubt that a trustee \xe2\x80\x9cwill \xe2\x80\xa6 fairly exercise\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion,\xe2\x80\x9d then courts \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ordinarily </em>will not fix the amount\xe2\x80\x9d of a payment \xe2\x80\x9cbut will instead direct the trustee to make reasonable provision for the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s support,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts \xc2\xa718.2.1, pp. 1348\xe2\x80\x931349 (5th ed. 2007) (emphasis added).  As this passage demonstrates, there are situations in which a court will typically defer to a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s remedial suggestion.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily\xe2\x80\x9d confirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recognize that there are instances in which courts will <em>not</em> defer.  And other treatises indicate that black letter trust law gives the district courts authority to decide which instances are which. See Bogert &amp; Bogert \xc2\xa7560, at 222\xe2\x80\x93223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court \xe2\x80\x9cmay set aside the transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caward damages to the beneficiary,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9corder a new decision to be made in the light of rules expounded by the court\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 Third Restatement \xc2\xa750, and Comment <em>b</em>, at 261 (discussing similar remedial options); 1 Second Restatement \xc2\xa7187, and Comment <em>b</em>, at 402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement \xc2\xa787, and Comment <em>c</em>, at 244\xe2\x80\x93245 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial intervention on the ground of abuse\xe2\x80\x9d is allowed when a \xe2\x80\x9cgood-faith,\xe2\x80\x9d yet \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d decision is made by a trustee); <em>Rubion, supra, </em>at 54\xe2\x80\x9355, 308 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial options).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as establishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fallback position absent \xe2\x80\x9creason to believe that [the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly\xe2\x80\x94for example, upon a showing that the trustee has already acted in bad faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 6.  And based on this reading, the majority further concludes that the existence of the Scott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under basic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a remedy for a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of discretion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the passage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writers, compare <em>ante</em>, at 6 (discussing Scott) with <em>ante, </em>at 8 (discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so easily be read as consistent with one another.  I simply read the Scott treatise language as identifying circumstances in which courts typically <em>choose</em> to defer to an administrator\xe2\x80\x99s fallback position.  The treatise does not suggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own in the exercise of its broad remedial authority\xe2\x80\x94authority that trust law plainly grants to supervising courts.  See <em>supra,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this understanding.  The treatise cites seven cases in support of the passage upon which the majority relies.  See 3 Scott \xc2\xa718.2.1, at 1349, n.\xc2\xa04.  Three of these cases explicitly state that a court <em>may</em> exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if a trustee has previously abused its discretion.  See <em>Old Colony Trust Co.</em> v. <em>Rodd</em>, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 886, 889 (1970) (\xe2\x80\x9cA court of equity may control a trustee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to observe standards of judgment apparent from the applicable instrument\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Marre\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</em>, 18 Cal.\xc2\xa02d 184, 190, 114 P.\xc2\xa02d 586, 590\xe2\x80\x93591 (1941) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well settled that the courts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has been confided to a trustee <em>unless</em> it is clear that the trustee has abused his discretion <em>in some manner</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ferrall\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</em>, 92 Cal.

Three other cases are inapposite because their circumstances do not involve <em>any </em>allegation of abuse of discretion by the trustee.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ziegler\xe2\x80\x99s Trusts</em>, 157 So.\xc2\xa02d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no contention here that the court . . . would not retain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other pleadings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if any, of the discretion exercised by the trustees\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Grubel\xe2\x80\x99s Will</em>, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 21, 23 (Surr.

In the final case, the court decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to control the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 discretion.  See <em>Estate of Stillman</em>, 107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 701 (Surr. Ct. 1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fine record of the trustees in enhancing the equity of these trusts while earning substantial income, also persuades the court of the wisdom of retaining their services as fiduciaries\xe2\x80\x9d).  Which of these cases says that, after the trustee has abused its discretion, a district court <em>must</em> still defer to the trustee?  <em>None of them do</em>.  I repeat: Not a single case<em> </em>cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the treatise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott treatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa01.  I am not surprised that the treatise does not refer to these cases.  In the first three, a court thought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised judgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee to do so.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s Will</em>, 144 Neb. 36, 40\xe2\x80\x9341, 12 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 148, 150\xe2\x80\x93151 (1943) (finding that the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to act\xe2\x80\x9d was erroneous, and directing the trustees to exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount); <em>Eaton</em> v. <em>Eaton</em>, 82 N.\xc2\xa0H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926) (same); <em>Finch</em> v. <em>Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em>, 156 N.\xc2\xa0C. App. 343, 347\xe2\x80\x93348, 577 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 306, 309\xe2\x80\x93310 (2003) (holding trustee erred by \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ail[ing] to exercise judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and directing it to do so).  The fourth case concerns circumstances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to know what to say.  (The question was whether the beneficiary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or whether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate them in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding that, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in that particular case should seek to have the trustee removed rather than trying to administer the trust funds itself.)  See <em>Hanford</em> v. <em>Clancy</em>, 87 N.\xc2\xa0H. 458, 460\xe2\x80\x93461, 183 A. 271, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (1936).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to which the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a general matter, is <em>required </em>to defer to a trust administrator\xe2\x80\x99s <em>second attempt</em> at exercising discretion.  And I am aware of no such case.  In contrast, the Restatement and Bogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in which courts have remedied a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of discretion by ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount.  See 2 Third Restatement \xc2\xa750, Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Note, at 283 (citing cases such as <em>Coker</em> v. <em>Coker</em>, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566 (1922)); Bogert &amp; Bogert \xc2\xa7560, at 223, n.\xc2\xa019 (citing cases such as <em>Rubion</em>); 3 Scott \xc2\xa718.2.1, at 1348\xe2\x80\x931349, nn.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934 (citing cases such as <em>Emmert</em> v. <em>Old Nat.

I thus do not find trust law \xe2\x80\x9cunclear\xe2\x80\x9d on this matter.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  When a trustee abuses its discretion, trust law grants courts the authority either to defer anew to the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s discretion or to craft a remedy.  See, <em>e.g., </em>3 A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts \xc2\xa7187, pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315 (4th ed. 1988) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis ordinarily means that so long as [the trustee] acts not only in good faith and from proper motives, but also within the bounds of reasonable judgment, the court will not interfere; but the court will inter-\nfere when he acts outside the bounds of a reasonable judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does anything in the present case suggest that the District Court abused its remedial authority.  The Second Circuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand was in essence a remedial problem.  See 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 268.  It added that the remedial problem was \xe2\x80\x9cdifficul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court \xe2\x80\xa6 may wish to employ equitable principles when determining the appropriate calculation and fashioning the appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Administrator had previously abused his discretionary power.  <em>Id.,</em> at 265\xe2\x80\x93268.  And the District Court found that the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s primary remedial suggestion on remand\xe2\x80\x94adjusting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 previous benefits distributions by adding interest\xe2\x80\x94probably would have violated ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s notice provisions.  472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 457.  Under these circumstances, the District Court reasonably could have found a need to use its own remedial judgment, rather than rely on the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94which is just what the Second Circuit said.  535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 119.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d trust law \xe2\x80\x9cquestion before us\xe2\x80\x9d were difficult, <em>ante, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x94which it is not\xe2\x80\x94this difficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its best to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects basic principles of trust law.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress invoked the common law of trusts\xe2\x80\x9d in enacting ERISA, and this Court has thus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular duties and powers\xe2\x80\x9d of ERISA plan administrators.  <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund</em> v. <em>Central Transport, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/559/index.html"></a><a href="/us/472/559/index.html">472 U.

To the contrary, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s absolute \xe2\x80\x9cone free honest mistake\xe2\x80\x9d rule is impractical, for it requires courts to determine what is \xe2\x80\x9chonest,\xe2\x80\x9d encourages appeals on the point, and threatens to delay further proceedings that already take too long. (Respondents initially filed this retirement benefits case in 1999.)  See <em>Glenn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 10).  It also ignores what we previously have pointed out\xe2\x80\x94namely, that abuses of discretion \xe2\x80\x9carise in too many contexts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconcern too many circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d for this Court \xe2\x80\x9cto come up with a one-size-fits-all procedural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accurate\xe2\x80\x9d benefits determinations.  <em>Ibid</em>.

See <em>ante, </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9313.  But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset by the factors discussed above\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, discouraging administrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them aggressively\xe2\x80\x94that argue to the contrary.  At best, the policies at issue\xe2\x80\x94some arguing in one direction, some the other\xe2\x80\x94are far less able than trust law to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cguiding principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere, trust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to approach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 111\xe2\x80\x93113.  And trust law here, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the decision as to how much weight to give to a plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s remedial opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the District Court was not required to defer to the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s fallback position, I should consider the second question presented, namely, whether the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision under an \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (acknowledging, but not reaching, this issue).  The answer to this question depends upon how one characterizes the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision.  If the court deferred to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Plan terms, then the Court of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the decision <em>de novo.  </em>See <em>Firestone, supra</em>, at 112; cf. <em>Davila</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 210 (\xe2\x80\x9cAny dispute over the precise terms of the plan is resolved by a court under a <em>de novo</em> review standard\xe2\x80\x9d).  If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s creation of a remedy, in significant part on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9cequitable principles,\xe2\x80\x9d then it properly reviewed the District Court decision for \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., Cook</em> v. <em>Liberty Life Assurance Co.</em>, 320 F.\xc2\xa03d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); <em>Zervos</em> v. <em>Verizon N.\xc2\xa0Y., Inc.</em>, 277 F.\xc2\xa03d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); <em>Grosz-Salomon</em> v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.</em>, 237 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); <em>Halpin</em> v. <em>W.\xc2\xa0W. Grainger, Inc.</em>, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court opinion contains language that supports either characterization.  On the one hand, the court wrote that its task was to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret the Plan as written.\xe2\x80\x9d  472 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 457.  On the other hand, the court said that \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the [Summary Plan Description]\xe2\x80\x9d about how to treat prior distributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the Court of Appeals had directed it to use \xe2\x80\x9cequitable principles\xe2\x80\x9d in fashioning a remedy.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Ultimately, the District Court appears to have used both the Plan language and equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion.  See <em>id.</em>, at 457\xe2\x80\x93459.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports both characterizations.  Compare 535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 117 (noting that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9capplied [Plan] terms\xe2\x80\x9d in crafting its remedy), with <em>id.</em>, at 117\xe2\x80\x93119 (describing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision as the \xe2\x80\x9ccraft[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cremedy\xe2\x80\x9d and acknowledging that it had directed the District Court to use \xe2\x80\x9cequitable principles\xe2\x80\x9d in doing so).  But the Court of Appeals ultimately treated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as if it primarily created a fair remedy.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Given the prior Court of Appeals opinion\xe2\x80\x99s language, <em>supra,</em> at 6 (quoting 433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a correct, view.  And I consequently believe the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the result for an \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seeking relief under 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), the Court of Appeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the remedy as anything other than an application of a plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  Brief for Petitioners 55\xe2\x80\x9356; Reply Brief for Petitioners 3, and n.\xc2\xa08, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  While this provision allows plaintiffs only to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cclarify\xe2\x80\x9d rights or to \xe2\x80\x9crecover benefits\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c<em>under the terms of the plan</em>,<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em> \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added), it does not so limit a court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial authority, <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Knudson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/204/index.html">534 U. S. 204</a>, 221 (2002) (In \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), \xe2\x80\x9cCongress authorized \xe2\x80\x98a participant or beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99 to bring a civil action \xe2\x80\xa6 without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought is legal or equitable\xe2\x80\x9d).  The provision thus does not prohibit a court from shaping relief through the application of equitable principles, as trust law plainly permits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2<em> </em>Third Restatement \xc2\xa750, and Comment <em>b</em>, at 261 (discussing remedial options); Bogert &amp; Bogert \xc2\xa7870, at 123\xe2\x80\x93126 (2d rev. ed. 1995).  Indeed, a court that finds, for example, that an administrator provided employees with inadequate notice of a plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms (as was true here) may have no alternative but to rely significantly upon those principles.  Cf. 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary must \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge his dut[y] \xe2\x80\xa6 in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent\xe2\x80\x9d with ERISA).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.  And I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary determination.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX</p>\n<p align="left">The \xe2\x80\x9cPhantom Account\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative example of, as I understand it, how the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d works.  For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the following assumptions:  John worked at Xerox for 10 years from 1970 to 1980.  At the time of his departure from Xerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of $140,000.  He was then rehired in January 1989, and he worked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until December 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second term of employment.  I also assume that (1) Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to John\xe2\x80\x99s investment account was $2,500 in 1989 (the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to John\xe2\x80\x99s cash and investment accounts are always made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of return in John\xe2\x80\x99s cash and investment accounts is always 5 percent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.  (For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpetuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the annuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Payment/Annuity Rate.)</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the above assumptions, John\xe2\x80\x99s pension upon his retirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.4 percent\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa015 years), which has a present value of $210,000 ($10,500/5 percent).  John\xe2\x80\x99s cash and investment accounts at the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While Xerox\xe2\x80\x99s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until 1990, each employee\xe2\x80\x99s opening cash account balance was credited with the balance of his investment account at the end of 1989.  The figures for John\xe2\x80\x99s cash account in 1989 thus reflect the performance of his investment account.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator would assume that John had never left Xerox when calculating John\xe2\x80\x99s pension.  The Plan Administrator would also assume, when calculating the value of John\xe2\x80\x99s cash and investment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John had received from Xerox had remained invested in his accounts.  (In other words, the Plan Administrator would include the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d in his calculations.  The total value of this phantom account in 1989, when John rejoined Xerox, is equal to John\xe2\x80\x99s lump-sum distribution of $140,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.05<font super="1">9, or approximately $217,200.)</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Plan Administrator would thus compare John\xe2\x80\x99s pension, column D, and column H to determine John\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.  As you can see above, column H provides the greatest benefit, so John\xe2\x80\x99s cash account would be used to calculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, the Plan Administrator would \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d John\xe2\x80\x99s prior distribution against his current benefits to determine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.  Thus, the Plan Administrator would take the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal\xe2\x80\x9d value of John\xe2\x80\x99s cash account, including the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d ($277,800), and subtract out the value of the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d ($264,000).  The total present value of the benefits John would receive upon his second retirement would thus be $13,800.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This means that John would receive approximately $690 annually ($13,800\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05 percent) upon retirement under the Plan Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  In comparison, if John had simply been treated as a new employee when he was rehired, his pension would have entitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.4 percent\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05 years) upon his retirement.  And the impact of the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account\xe2\x80\x9d may have been even more dramatic with respect to some of the respondents in this case.  See Brief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul Frommert erroneously received a report claiming that his retirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later discovering that, because of the \xe2\x80\x9cphantom account,\xe2\x80\x9d his actual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also App. 63a.</f></p>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div>'
