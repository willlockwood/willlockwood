As relevant here, petitioners argued that respondents violated their fiduciary duties with respect to three mutual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and three mutual funds added to the Plan in 2002.  Petitioners argued that respondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced retail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available.  Because ERISA requires a breach of fiduciary duty complaint to be filed no more than six years after \xe2\x80\x9cthe date of the last action which constitutes a part of the breach or violation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71113, the District Court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint as to the 1999 funds was untimely because they were included in the Plan more than six years before the complaint was filed, and the circumstances had not changed enough within the 6-year statutory period to place respondents under an obligation to review the mutual funds and to convert them to lower priced  institutional-class funds.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that petitioners had not established a change in circumstances that might trigger an obligation to conduct a full due diligence review of the 1999 funds within the 6-year statutory period.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit erred by applying \xc2\xa71113\xe2\x80\x99s statutory bar to a breach of fiduciary duty claim based on the initial selection of the investments without considering the contours of the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty is \xe2\x80\x9cderived from the common law of trusts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund</i> v. <i>Central Transport, Inc.</i>,\n\n472 U. S. 559\n, which provides that a trustee has a continuing duty\xe2\x80\x94separate and apart from the duty to exercise prudence in selecting investments at the outset\xe2\x80\x94to monitor, and remove imprudent, trust investments.  So long as a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim alleging breach of the continuing duty of prudence occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely.  This Court expresses no view on the scope of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 fiduciary duty in this case, <i>e.g</i>., whether a review of the contested mutual funds is required, and, if so, just what kind of review.  A fiduciary must discharge his responsibilities \xe2\x80\x9cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\xe2\x80\x9d that a prudent person \xe2\x80\x9cacting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters\xe2\x80\x9d would use.  \xc2\xa71104(a)(1).  The case is remanded for the Ninth Circuit to consider petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims that respondents breached their duties within the relevant 6-year statutory period under \xc2\xa71113, recognizing the importance of analogous trust law.

The question before us concerns application of this provision to the timeliness of a fiduciary duty complaint.  It requires us to consider whether a fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly imprudent retention of an investment is an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9comission\xe2\x80\x9d that triggers the running of the 6-year limitations period.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2007, several individual beneficiaries of the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan (Plan) filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Plan and all similarly situated beneficiaries (collectively, petitioners) against Edison International and others (collectively, respondents).  Petitioners sought to recover damages for alleged losses suffered by the Plan, in addition to injunctive and other equitable relief based on al-leged breaches of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Plan is a defined-contribution plan, meaning that participants\xe2\x80\x99 retirement benefits are limited to the value of their own individual investment accounts, which is determined by the market performance of employee and employer contributions, less expenses.  Expenses, such as management or administrative fees, can sometimes significantly reduce the value of an account in a defined-contribution plan.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As relevant here, petitioners argued that respondents violated their fiduciary duties with respect to three mu-tual funds added to the Plan in 1999 and three mutual funds added to the Plan in 2002.  Petitioners argued that respondents acted imprudently by offering six higher priced retail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available (the lower price reflects lower administrative costs).  Specifically, petitioners claimed that a large institutional investor with billions of dollars, like the Plan, can obtain materially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual funds that are not available to a retail investor.  Petitioners asked, how could respondents have acted prudently in offering the six higher priced retail-class mutual funds when respondents could have offered them effectively the same six mutual funds at the lower price offered to institutional investors like the Plan?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to the three funds added to the Plan in 2002, the District Court agreed.  It wrote that respondents had \xe2\x80\x9cnot offered any credible explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for offering retail-class, <i>i.e., </i>higher priced mutual funds that \xe2\x80\x9ccost the Plan participants wholly unnecessary [administrative] fees,\xe2\x80\x9d and it concluded that, with respect to those mutual funds, respondents had failed to exercise \xe2\x80\x9cthe care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that ERISA demands of fiduciaries.  No. CV 07\xe2\x80\x935359 (CD Cal., July 8, 2010), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65, 130, 142, 109.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to the three funds added to the Plan in 1999, how-ever, the District Court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims were untimely because, unlike the other contested mutual funds, these mutual funds were included in the Plan more than six years before the complaint was filed in 2007.  639 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1074, 1119\xe2\x80\x931120 (CD Cal. 2009).  As a result, the 6-year statutory period had run.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court allowed petitioners to argue that, despite the 1999 selection of the three mutual funds, their complaint was nevertheless timely because these funds underwent significant changes <i>within </i>the 6-year statutory period that should have prompted respondents to undertake a full due-diligence review and convert the higher priced retail-class mutual funds to lower priced institutional-class mutual funds.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 142\xe2\x80\x93150.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court concluded, however, that petitioners had not met their burden of showing that a prudent fiduciary would have undertaken a full due-diligence review of these funds as a result of the alleged changed circumstances.  According to the District Court, the circumstances had not changed enough to place respondents under an obligation to review the mutual funds and to convert them to lower priced institutional-class mutual funds.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court as to the six mutual funds.  729 F.\xc2\xa03d 1110 (2013).  With respect to the three mutual funds added in 1999, the Ninth Circuit held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims were untimely because petitioners had not established a change in circumstances that might trigger an obligation to review and to change investments within the 6-year statutory period.  Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari asking us to review this latter holding.  We agreed to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1113 reads, in relevant part, that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o action may be commenced with respect to a fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s breach of any responsibility, duty, or obligation\xe2\x80\x9d after the earlier of \xe2\x80\x9csix years after (A) the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Both clauses of that provision require only a \xe2\x80\x9cbreach or violation\xe2\x80\x9d to start the 6-year period.  Petitioners contend that respondents breached the duty of prudence by offering higher priced retail-class mutual funds when the same investments were available as lower priced institutional-class mutual funds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit, without considering the role of the fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s duty of prudence under trust law, rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims as untimely under \xc2\xa71113 on the basis that respondents had selected the three mutual funds more than six years before petitioners brought this action.  The Ninth Circuit correctly asked whether the \xe2\x80\x9clast action which constituted a part of the breach or violation\xe2\x80\x9d of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 duty of prudence occurred <i>within</i> the relevant 6-year period.  It focused, however, upon the act of \xe2\x80\x9cdesignating an investment for inclusion\xe2\x80\x9d to start the 6-year period.  729 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1119.  The Ninth Circuit stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]haracterizing the mere continued offering of a plan option, without more, as a subsequent breach would render\xe2\x80\x9d the statute meaningless and could even expose present fiduciaries to liability for decisions made decades ago.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1120.  But the Ninth Circuit jumped from this observation to the conclusion that <i>only </i>a significant change in circumstances could engender a new breach of a fiduciary duty, stating that the District Court was \xe2\x80\x9centirely correct\xe2\x80\x9d to have entertained the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9csig-nificant changes\xe2\x80\x9d occurring \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d might require \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a full due diligence review of the funds,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent to the diligence review that respondents conduct when adding new funds to the Plan.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We believe the Ninth Circuit erred by applying a statu-tory bar to a claim of a \xe2\x80\x9cbreach or violation\xe2\x80\x9d of a fiduciary duty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty.  The Ninth Circuit did not recognize that under trust law a fiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its investment with the nature and timing of the review contingent on the circumstances.  Of course, after the Ninth Circuit considers trust-law principles, it is possible that it will conclude that respondents did indeed conduct the sort of review that a prudent fiduciary would have conducted absent a significant change in circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An ERISA fiduciary must discharge his responsibility \xe2\x80\x9cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\xe2\x80\x9d that a prudent person \xe2\x80\x9cacting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters\xe2\x80\x9d would use.  \xc2\xa71104(a)(1); see also <i>Fifth Third Bancorp</i> v. <i>Dudenhoeffer</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  We have often noted that an ERISA fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s duty is \xe2\x80\x9cderived from the common law of trusts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund</i> v. <i>Central Transport, Inc.</i>,\n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 559,\n570 (1985)\n.  In determining the contours of an ERISA fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s duty, courts often must look to the law of trusts.  We are aware of no reason why the Ninth Circuit should not do so here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under trust law, a trustee has a continuing duty to monitor trust investments and remove imprudent ones.  This continuing duty exists separate and apart from the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duty to exercise prudence in selecting investments at the outset.  The Bogert treatise states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trustee cannot assume that if investments are legal and proper for retention at the beginning of the trust, or when purchased, they will remain so indefinitely.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Hess, G. Bogert, &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \xc2\xa7684, pp. 145\xe2\x80\x93146 (3d ed. 2009) (Bogert 3d).  Rather, the trustee must \xe2\x80\x9csystematic[ally] conside[r] all the investments of the trust at regular intervals\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that they are appropriate.  Bogert 3d \xc2\xa7684, at 147\xe2\x80\x93148; see also <i>In\xc2\xa0re Stark\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</i>,<i> </i>15 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 729, 731 (Surr. Ct. 1891) (stating that a trustee must \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] a reasonable degree of diligence in looking after the security after the investment had been made\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Johns </i>v. <i>Herbert</i>, 2 App. D. C. 485, 499 (1894) (holding trustee liable for failure to discharge his \xe2\x80\x9cduty to watch the investment with reasonable care and diligence\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Restatement (Third) of Trusts states the following:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties apply not only in making investments but also in monitoring and reviewing investments, which is to be done in a manner that isreasonable and appropriate to the particular investments, courses of action, and strategies involved.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa790, Comment <i>b</i>, p. 295 (2007).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Uniform Prudent Investor Act confirms that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]anaging embraces monitoring\xe2\x80\x9d and that a trustee has \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing responsibility for oversight of the suitability of the investments already made.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72, Comment, 7B U. L. A. 21 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Scott on Trusts implies as much by stating that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the trust estate includes assets that are inappropriate as trust investments, the trustee is ordinarily under a duty to dispose of them within a reasonable time.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts \xc2\xa719.3.1, p. 1439 (5th ed. 2007).  Bogert says the same. Bogert 3d \xc2\xa7685, at 156\xe2\x80\x93157 (explaining that if an investment is determined to be imprudent, the trustee \xe2\x80\x9cmust dispose of it within a reasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d); see, <i>e.g., State Street Trust Co. </i>v. <i>DeKalb</i>, 259 Mass. 578, 583, 157 N.\xc2\xa0E. 334, 336 (1927) (trustee was required to take action to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the rights of the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d when the value of trust assets declined).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, under trust law, a fiduciary normally has a continuing duty of some kind to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.  A plaintiff may allege that a fiduciary breached the duty of prudence by failing to properly monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.  In such a case, so long as the alleged breach of the continuing duty occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely.  The Ninth Circuit erred by applying a 6-year statutory bar based solely on the initial selection of the three funds without considering the contours of the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The parties now agree that the duty of prudence involves a continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones under trust law.  Brief for Petitioners 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cTrust law imposes a duty to examine the prudence of existing investments periodically and to remove imprudent investments\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Respondents 3 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll agree that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor trust investments to ensure that they remain prudent\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe duty of prudence under ERISA, as under trust law, requires plan fiduciaries with investment responsibility to examine periodically the prudence of existing investments and to remove imprudent investments within a reasonable period of time\xe2\x80\x9d).  The parties disagree, however, with respect to the scope of that responsibility.  Did it require a review of the contested mutual funds here, and if so, just what kind of review did it require?  A fiduciary must discharge his responsibilities \xe2\x80\x9cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\xe2\x80\x9d that a prudent person \xe2\x80\x9cacting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters\xe2\x80\x9d would use.  \xc2\xa71104(a)(1).  We express no view on the scope of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 fiduciary duty in this case.  We remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims that respondents breached their duties within the relevant 6-year period under \xc2\xa71113, recognizing the importance of analogous trust law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A final point: Respondents argue that petitioners did not raise the claim below that respondents committed new breaches of the duty of prudence by failing to monitor their investments and remove imprudent ones absent a significant change in circumstances.  We leave any questions of forfeiture for the Ninth Circuit on remand.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is vacated, and the case isremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered<i>.</i></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
