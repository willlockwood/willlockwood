Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html">406 U. S. 91</a></span>.  Accordingly, Illinois filed suit (and respondent State of Michigan intervened) in Federal District Court seeking abatement, under federal common law, of the public nuisance petitioners were allegedly creating by their discharges.  Five months later, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Act) Amendments of 1972, which established a new system of regulation making it illegal to discharge pollutants into the Nation\'s waters except pursuant to a permit that incorporated as conditions regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishing specific effluent limitations.  Permits are issued either by the EPA or a qualifying state agency, and petitioners operated their sewer systems under permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  While the federal court action was pending, DNR brought an action in a Wisconsin state court to compel compliance with the permits\' requirements, and the state court entered a judgment requiring discharges from the treatment plants to meet effluent limitations in the permits and establishing a timetable for additional construction to control sewage overflows.  Thereafter, the District Court found that the existence of a federal common law nuisance had been proved, and entered a judgment specifying effluent limitations for treated sewage and a construction timetable to eliminate overflows that went considerably beyond the terms of petitioners\' permits and the state court\'s enforcement order.  The Court of Appeals, ruling that the 1972 Amendments of the Act had not preempted the federal common law of nuisance, upheld the District Court\'s order as to elimination of overflows, but reversed insofar as the District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 451 U.

Federal common law in an area of national concern is resorted to in the absence of an applicable Act of Congress, and because the Court is compelled to consider federal questions which cannot be answered from federal statutes alone.  As recognized in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/100/case.html#107">451 U. S. 107</a></span>, when Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law, the need for such an unusual exercise of lawmaking by federal courts disappears.  Unlike the determination of whether federal law preempts state law, which requires evidence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt state law, the determination of whether federal statutory or federal common law governs starts with the assumption that it is for Congress, not federal courts, to articulate appropriate standards to be applied as a matter of federal law.

Milwaukee,</em> has not left the formulation of appropriate federal standards to the courts through application of often vague and indeterminate nuisance concepts and maxims of equity jurisprudence, but rather has occupied the field through the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory program supervised by an expert administrative agency.

S. 317</a></span>-319.</p>\n<p>(b) As contemplated by Congress, the problem of effluent limitations for discharges from petitioners\' treatment plants has been thoroughly addressed through the administrative scheme established by Congress, and thus there is no basis for a federal court, by reference to federal common law, to impose more stringent limitations.  Similarly, the overflows of untreated sewage from petitioners\' sewer system have been addressed by the regulatory regime established by the Act, through DNR\'s imposing conditions suited to further the Act\'s goals and bringing an enforcement action specifically addressed to the overflow problem.  Nor does the absence of overflow effluent limitations in the permits and the state court enforcement order render federal common law available, since the relevant question is not what concentration of various pollutants will be permitted, but what degree of control will be required in preventing overflows and ensuring that the sewage undergoes treatment.  Decision is to be made by the appropriate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 451 U. S. 306</a></p><p> agency on a case-by-case basis, through the permit procedure, as was done here.

Milwaukee</em> was decided, Illinois did not have any forum in which to protect its interests unless federal common law were created.  However, in the 1972 Amendments, Congress provided ample opportunity for a State affected by decisions of a neighboring State\'s permit-granting agency to seek redress.  Respondents did not avail themselves of the statutory procedures.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#325">451 U.

Milwaukee.</em>  Nothing in \xc2\xa7 510 suggests that the States may call upon federal courts to employ federal common law to establish more stringent standards applicable to out-of-state discharges.  Nor does a subdivision in the citizen suit provision of the Act -- \xc2\xa7 505(e), which provides that nothing "in this section" shall limit any other remedies which might exist -- indicate congressional intent to preserve the federal common law remedy.  It does not mean that the Act, as a whole, does not supplant formerly available federal common law actions, but means only that the particular section authorizing citizen suits does not do so.

Together, they construct, operate, and maintain sewer facilities serving Milwaukee County, an area of some 420 square miles with a population of over one million people. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The facilities consist of a series of sewer systems and two sewage treatment plants located on the shores of Lake Michigan 25 and 39 miles from the Illinois border, respectively.  The sewer systems are of both the "separated" and "combined" variety.  A separated sewer system carries only sewage for treatment; a combined sewer system gathers both sewage and storm water runoff and transports them in the same conduits for treatment.  On occasion, particularly after a spell of wet weather, overflows occur in the system which result in the discharge of sewage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 451 U. S. 309</a></p><p> directly into Lake Michigan or tributaries leading into Lake Michigan. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The overflows occur at discrete discharge points throughout the system.</p>\n<p>Respondent Illinois complains that these discharges, as well as the inadequate treatment of sewage at the two treatment plants, constitute a threat to the health of its citizens.  Pathogens, disease-causing viruses and bacteria, are allegedly discharged into the lake with the overflows and inadequately treated sewage, and then transported by lake currents to Illinois waters.  Illinois also alleges that nutrients in the sewage accelerate the eutrophication, or aging, of the lake.

Milwaukee, supra.</em>  We declined to exercise original jurisdiction because the dispute was not between two States, and Illinois had available an action in federal district court.  The Court reasoned that federal law applied to the dispute, one between a sovereign State and political subdivisions of another State concerning pollution of interstate waters, but that the various laws which Congress had enacted "touching interstate waters" were "not necessarily the only federal remedies available."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#101">406 U.

Permits are issued either by the EPA or a qualifying state agency.  Petitioners operated their sewer systems and discharged effluent under permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which had duly qualified under \xc2\xa7 402(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b) (1976 ed. and Supp. III), as a permit-granting agency under the superintendence of the EPA.  <em>See EPA v.

The detention facilities to be constructed must be large enough to permit full treatment of water from any storm up to the largest storm on record for the Milwaukee area.  <em>Id.</em> at D-1.  Both the aspects of the decision concerning overflows and concerning effluent limitations, with the exception of the effluent limitation for phosphorus, went considerably beyond the terms of petitioners\' previously issued permits and the enforcement order of the state court.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  599 F.2d 151.  The court ruled that the 1972 Amendments had not preempted the federal common law of nuisance, but that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n applying the federal common law of nuisance in a water pollution case, a court should not ignore the Act, but should look to its policies and principles for guidance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 164.  The court reversed the District Court insofar as the effluent limitations it imposed on treated sewage were more stringent than those in the permits and applicable EPA regulations.

The Death on the High Seas Act, however, announces Congress\' considered judgment on such issues as the beneficiaries, the limitations period, contributory negligence, survival, and damages. . . .

Thus the question was whether the legislative scheme "spoke directly to a question" -- in that case the question of damages -- not whether Congress had affirmatively proscribed the use of federal common law.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We conclude that, at least so far as concerns the claims of respondents, Congress has not left the formulation of appropriate federal standards to the courts through application of often vague and indeterminate nuisance concepts and maxims of equity jurisprudence, but rather has occupied the field through the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory program supervised by an expert administrative agency.  The 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act were not merely another law "touching interstate waters" of the sort surveyed in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> 406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#101">406 U. S. 101</a></span>-103, and found inadequate to supplant federal common law.  Rather, the Amendments were viewed by Congress as a "total restructuring" and "complete rewriting" of the existing water pollution legislation considered in that case.  1 Leg.Hist. 350-351 (remarks of Chairman Blatnik of the House Committee which drafted the House version of the Amendments); <em>id.</em> at 359-30 (remarks of Rep.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Congress\' intent in enacting the Amendments was clearly to establish an all-encompassing program of water pollution regulation.  Every point source discharge [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] is prohibited unless covered by a permit, which directly subjects the discharger to the administrative apparatus established by Congress to achieve its goals.  The "major purpose" of the Amendments was "to establish a <em>comprehensive</em> long-range policy for the elimination of water pollution."  S.Rep. No. 9214, at 95, 2 Leg.Hist. 1511 (emphasis supplied).  No Congressman\'s remarks on the legislation were complete without reference to the "comprehensive" nature of the Amendments.  A House sponsor described the bill as "the most comprehensive and far-reaching water pollution bill we have ever drafted," 1 Leg.Hist. 369 (Rep. Mizell), and Senator Randolph, Chairman of the responsible Committee in the Senate, stated:</p>\n<p>"It is perhaps the most comprehensive legislation ever developed in its field.  It is perhaps the most comprehensive legislation that the Congress of the United States has ever developed in this particular field of the environment."</p>\n<p>2 <em>id.</em> at 1269. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  This Court was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 451 U.

City of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/35/case.html">420 U.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The establishment of such a self-consciously comprehensive program by Congress, which certainly did not exist when <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee</em> was decided, strongly suggests that there is no room for courts to attempt to improve on that program with federal common law.  <em>See Texas v. Pankey,</em> 441 F.2d at 241. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Turning to the particular claims involved in this case, the action of Congress in supplanting the federal common law is perhaps clearest when the question of effluent limitations for discharges from the two treatment plants is considered.  The duly issued permits under which the city Commission discharges treated sewage from the Jones Island and South Shore treatment plants incorporate, as required by the Act, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 402(b)(1), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b)(1) (1976 ed. and Supp.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 451 U. S. 320</a></p><p> III), the specific effluent limitations established by EPA regulations pursuant to \xc2\xa7 301 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1311 (1976 ed. and Supp. III).  App. 371-394, 39-524; <em>see</em> 40 CFR \xc2\xa7 133.102 (1980).  There is thus no question that the problem of effluent limitations has been thoroughly addressed through the administrative scheme established by Congress, as contemplated by Congress.  This being so, there is no basis for a federal court to impose more stringent limitations than those imposed under the regulatory regime by reference to federal common law, as the District Court did in this case.  The Court of Appeals, we believe, also erred in stating:</p>\n<p>"Neither the minimum effluent limitations prescribed by EPA pursuant to the provisions of the Act nor the effluent limitations imposed by the Wisconsin agency under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System limit a federal court\'s authority to require compliance with more stringent limitations under the federal common law."</p>\n<p>599 F.2d at 173.  Federal courts lack authority to impose more stringent effluent limitations under federal common law than those imposed by the agency charged by Congress with administering this comprehensive scheme.</p>\n<p>The overflows do not present a different case.  They are point source discharges and, under the Act, are prohibited unless subject to a duly issued permit.  As with the discharge of treated sewage, the overflows, through the permit procedure of the Act, are referred to expert administrative agencies for control.  All three of the permits issued to petitioners explicitly address the problem of overflows.  The Jones Island and South Shore permits, in addition to covering discharges from the treatment plants, also cover overflows from various lines leading to the plants.  As issued on December 24, 1974, these permits require the city Commission</p>\n<p>"to initiate a program leading to the elimination or control of all discharge overflow and/or bypass points in the [Jones Island or South </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 451 U. S. 321</a></p><p> Shore, respectively] Collector System . . . to assure attainment of all applicable Water Quality Standards."</p>\n<p>App. 378-379, 416.  The specific discharge points are identified.  The Commission was required to submit a detailed pan to DNR designed to achieve these objectives, including alternative engineering solutions and cost estimates, file a report on an attached form for all overflows that do occur, install monitoring devices on selected overflows discharge points, and file more detailed quarterly reports on the overflows from those points.  The Commission was also required to complete "facilities planning" for the combined sewer area.</p>\n<p>"The facilities planning elements include a feasibility study, cost effectiveness analysis, and environmental assessment for elimination or control of the discharges from the combined sewers."</p>\n<p>Quarterly progress reports on this planning are required.  <em>Id.</em> at 379.  A permit issued to the city on December 18, 1974, covers discharges "from sanitary sewer crossovers, combined sewer crossovers and combined sewer overflows."  <em>Id.</em> at 425.  Again the discharge points are specifically identified.  As to separated sewers, the city</p>\n<p>"is required to initiate a program leading to the elimination of the sanitary sewer crossovers (gravity) and the electrically operated relief pumps. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 438.  A detailed plan to achieve this objective must be submitted, again with alternative engineering solutions and cost estimates, any overflows must be reported to DNR on a specified form, and monitoring devices are required to be installed on selected points to provide more detailed quarterly reports.  As to the combined sewers, the city "is required to initiate a program leading to the attainment of control of overflows from the city\'s combined sewer system. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 443.  The city is required to cooperate with and assist the city Commission in facilities planning for combined sewers, <em>see supra,</em> this page, submit quarterly progress reports to DNR, file reports on all discharges, and install monitoring devices on selected discharge points to provide more detailed quarterly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 451 U. S. 322</a></p><p> reports "until the discharges are eliminated or controlled." App. 444. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The enforcement action brought by the DNR in state court resulted in a judgment requiring "[e]limination of any bypassing or overflowing which occurs within the sewerage systems under dry weather by not later than July 1, 1982."  <em>Id.</em> at 465.  Wet weather overflows from separated sewers were to be subject to a coordinated effort by the Commissions resulting in correction of the problem by July 1, 1986, pursuant to a plan submitted to the DNR.  <em>Id.</em> at 469-471.  As to the combined sewer overflows, the Commissions were required to accomplish an abatement project, with design work completed by July 1, 1981, and construction by July 1, 1993.  Annual progress reports were required to be submitted to the DNR.  <em>Id.</em> at 471-472.</p>\n<p>It is quite clear from the foregoing that the state agency </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 451 U. S. 323</a></p><p> duly authorized by the EPA to issue discharge permits under the Act has addressed the problem of overflows from petitioners\' sewer system.  The agency imposed the conditions it considered best suited to further the goals of the Act, and provided for detailed progress reports so that it could continually monitor the situation.  Enforcement action considered appropriate by the state agency was brought, as contemplated by the Act, again specifically addressed to the overflow problem.  There is no "interstice" here to be filled by federal common law:  overflows are covered by the Act, and have been addressed by the regulatory regime established by the Act.  Although a federal court may disagree with the regulatory approach taken by the agency with responsibility for issuing permits under the Act, such disagreement, alone, is no basis for the creation of federal common law. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents strenuously argue that federal common law continues to be available, stressing that neither in the permits nor the enforcement order are there any effluent limitations on overflows.  This argument, we think, is something of a red herring.  The difference in treatment between overflows and treated effluent by the agencies is due to differences in the nature of the problems, not the extent to which the problems have been addressed. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The relevant question with overflow discharges is not, as with discharges of treated sewage, what concentration of various pollutants will be permitted.  Rather, the question is what degree of control will be required in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 451 U. S. 324</a></p><p> preventing overflows and ensuring that the sewage undergoes treatment.  This question is answered by construction plans designed to accommodate a certain amount of sewage that would otherwise be discharged on overflow occasions.  The EPA has not promulgated regulations mandating specific control guidelines because of a recognition that the problem is "site-specific."  <em>See, e.g.,</em> EPA Program Requirements Memorandum PRM No. 75-34 (Dec. 16, 1975):</p>\n<p>"The costs and benefits of control of various portions of pollution due to combined sewer overflows and bypasses vary greatly with the characteristics of the sewer and treatment system, the duration, intensity, frequency, and aerial extent of precipitation, the type and extent of development in the service area, and the characteristics, uses and water quality standards of the receiving waters.  Decisions on grants for control of combined sewer overflows, therefore, must be made on a case-by-case basis after detailed planning at the local level."</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> EPA, Report to Congress on Control of Combined Sewer overflow in the United States 7-1, 7-13 (MCD-50, 1978).  Decision is made on a case-by-case basis, through the permit procedure, as was done here.  Demanding specific regulations of general applicability before concluding that Congress has addressed the problem to the exclusion of federal common law asks the wrong question.  The question is whether the field has been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a particular manner. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 451 U. S. 325</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The invocation of federal common law by the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the face of congressional legislation supplanting it is peculiarly inappropriate in areas as complex as water pollution control.  As the District Court noted:</p>\n<p>"It is well known to all of us that the arcane subject matter of some of the expert testimony in this case was sometimes over the heads of all of us to one height or another.  I would certainly be less than candid if I did not acknowledge that my grasp of some of the testimony was less complete than I would like it to be. . . ."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. F-4.  Not only are the technical problems difficult -- doubtless the reason Congress vested authority to administer the Act in administrative agencies possessing the necessary expertise -- but the general area is particularly unsuited to the approach inevitable under a regime of federal common law.  Congress criticized past approaches to water pollution control as being "sporadic" and "<em>ad hoc,</em>" S.Rep. No. 92-414, p. 95 (1971), 2 Leg.Hist. 1511, apt characterizations of any judicial approach applying federal common law, <em>see Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman\'s Fund Ins.

S. 319</a></span> (1955).</p>\n<p>It is also significant that Congress addressed in the 1972 Amendments one of the major concerns underlying the recognition of federal common law in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee.</em>  We were concerned in that case that Illinois did not have any forum in which to protect its interests unless federal common law were created.  <em>See</em> 406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#104">406 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#107">406 U. S. 107</a></span>.  In the 1972 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 451 U. S. 326</a></p><p> Amendments Congress provided ample opportunity for a State affected by decisions of a neighboring State\'s permit-granting agency to seek redress.  Under \xc2\xa7 402(b)(3), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b)(3), a state permit-granting agency must ensure that any State whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit receives notice of the permit application and the opportunity to participate in a public hearing.  Wisconsin law accordingly guarantees such notice and hearing, <em>see</em> Wis.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 147.11, 147.13 (West Supp. 1980-1981).  Respondents received notice of each of the permits involved here, and public hearings were held, but they did not participate in them in any way.  Section 402(b)(5), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(b)(5), provides that state permit-granting agencies must ensure that affected States have an opportunity to submit written recommendations concerning the permit applications to the issuing State and the EPA, and both the affected State and the EPA must receive notice and a statement of reasons if any part of the recommendations of the affected State are not accepted.  Again, respondents did not avail themselves of this statutory opportunity.  Under \xc2\xa7 402(d)(2)(A), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(d)(2)(A) (1976 ed., Supp. III), the EPA may veto any permit issued by a State when waters of another State may be affected.  Respondents did not request such action.  Under \xc2\xa7 402(d)(4) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(d)(4) (1976 ed., Supp. III), added in 1977, the EPA itself may issue permits if a stalemate between an issuing and objecting State develops.  The basic grievance of respondents is that the permits issued to petitioners pursuant to the Act do not impose stringent enough controls on petitioners\' discharges.  The statutory scheme established by Congress provides a forum for the pursuit of such claims before expert agencies by means of the permit-granting process.  It would be quite inconsistent with this scheme if federal courts were, in effect, to "write their own ticket" under the guise of federal common law after permits have already been issued and permittees have been planning and operating in reliance on them. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 451 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Section 510 provides that nothing in the Act shall preclude States from adopting and enforcing limitations on the discharge of pollutants more stringent than those adopted under the Act. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  It is one thing, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 451 U. S. 328</a></p><p> to say that States may adopt more stringent limitations through state administrative processes, or even that States may establish such limitations through state nuisance law, and apply them to in-state dischargers.  It is quite another to say that the States may call upon <em>federal</em> courts to employ <em>federal</em> common law to establish more stringent standards applicable to out-of-state dischargers.  Any standards established under federal common law are federal standards, and so the authority of States to impose more stringent standards under \xc2\xa7 510 would not seem relevant.  Section 510 clearly contemplates state authority to establish more stringent pollution limitations; nothing in it, however, suggests that this was to be done by federal court actions premised on federal common law.</p>\n<p>Subsection 505(e) provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing <em>in this section</em> shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief (including relief against the Administrator or a State agency)."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)  Respondents argue that this evinces an intent to preserve the federal common law of nuisance.  We, however, are inclined to view the quoted provision as meaning what it says:  that nothing <em>in \xc2\xa7 505,</em> the citizen suit provision, should be read as limiting any other remedies which might exist.</p>\n<p>Subsection 505(e) is virtually identical to subsections in the citizen suit provisions of several environmental statutes. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 451 U. S. 329</a></p><p> The subsection is common language accompanying citizen suit provisions, and we think that it means only that the provision of such suit does not revoke other remedies.  It most assuredly cannot be read to mean that the Act as a whole does not supplant formerly available federal common law actions, but only that the particular section authorizing citizen suits does not do so.  No one, however, maintains that the citizen suit provision preempts federal common law.</p>\n<p>We are thus not persuaded that \xc2\xa7 505(e) aids respondents in this case, even indulging the unlikely assumption that the reference to "common law" in \xc2\xa7 505(e) includes the limited federal common law, as opposed to the more routine state common law.  <em>See Committee for Consideration of Jones Falls Sewage System v.

The provision which concerned Senator Griffin, enacted as \xc2\xa7 402(k), 86 Stat. 883, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(k), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"Until December 31, 1974, in any case where a permit for discharge has been applied for pursuant to this section, but final administrative disposition of such application has not been made, such discharge shall not be a violation of (1) section 301, 306, or 402 of this Act, or (2) section 13 of the Act of March 3, 1899, unless the Administrator or other plaintiff proves that final administrative disposition of such application has not been made because of the failure of the applicant to furnish information reasonably required or requested in order to process the application."</p>\n<p>Senator Griffin was concerned about the relation between this provision and \xc2\xa7 4(a) of the bill, which provided that</p>\n<p>"[n]o suit, action or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the Administrator or any other officer or employee of the United States in his official capacity or in relation to the discharge of his official duties under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as in effect immediately prior to the date of enactment of the Act shall abate by reason of the taking effect of the amendment made by section 2 of this Act."</p>\n<p>Senator Griffin stated that,</p>\n<p>"when these provisions are read together, it is not altogether clear what effect is intended with respect to pending Federal court suits against pollutors violating the Refuse Act of 1899."</p>\n<p>Senator Muskie responded to Senator Griffin\'s concerns by <em>quoting \xc2\xa7 4(a)</em> and stating that,</p>\n<p>"[w]ithout any question, it was the intent of the conferees that this provision include enforcement actions brought under the Refuse Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and any other acts of Congress."</p>\n<p>1 Leg.Hist.193.  Later, Senator Hart stated:</p>\n<p>"It is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 451 U. S. 331</a></p><p> my understanding, . . . after the explanation of the Senator from Maine, that the suit now pending against the Reserve Mining Co. under the Refuse Act of 1899 will in no way be affected, nor will any of the other counts under the existing Federal Water Pollution Control Act or other law."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 211. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  When Senator Muskie\'s and Hart\'s remarks are viewed in this context it is clear that they do not bear on the issue now before the Court.  In the first place, although there was a federal common law claim in the Reserve Mining litigation, Senator Griffin focused on the Refuse Act of 1899 -- not federal common law.  Senator Muskie, with his reference to "other acts of Congress," rather clearly was not discussing federal <em>common</em> law.  Most importantly, however, Senator Muskie based his response to Senator Griffin -- that the Reserve Mining suit would not be affected -- on a specific section of the bill, \xc2\xa7 4(a), which is not applicable to suits other than those brought by or against the Federal Government and pending when the Amendments were enacted.  Senator Hart based his response on the explanation given by Senator Muskie.  Even if we assumed that the legislators were focusing on the federal common law aspects of the Reserve Mining litigation (and we do not think they were), Senators Muskie and Hart informed Senator Griffin that the Reserve Mining suit was not affected <em>because of \xc2\xa7 4(a),</em> and not at all because the Act did not displace the federal common law of nuisance.  Senator Griffin\'s question focused on \xc2\xa7 4(a); understandably, so did the assurances he received.  Nothing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 451 U. S. 332</a></p><p> about the colloquy suggests any intent concerning the continued validity of federal common law.  The issue simply did not come up, because Senator Griffin\'s concerns were fully answered by a particular section not applicable in the case before us. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that no federal common law remedy was available to respondents in this case.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>It is the statutory responsibility of the city Commission to</p>\n<p>"project, plan, construct, maintain and establish a sewerage system for the collection, transmission, and disposal of all sewage and drainage of the city."</p>\n<p>Wis.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 62 .61(1) (West Supp. 1980-1981).

The county Commission is responsible for the construction of sewers within the metropolitan area but outside city limits.  \xc2\xa7 59.96(6)(a).  The city operates some sewers within the city, although the powers of the city Commission include the use and alteration, in its discretion, of "any or all existing public sewers or drains, including storm-water sewers and drains, in the city."  \xc2\xa7 62.61(1)(e).

Since ground water and water from storm sewers occasionally enter separated sewers, overflows in those systems are also more likely during wet weather.  When the system is about to exceed its inherent capacity at given points, overflow devices, either mechanical or gravity, are activated, resulting in the discharge of the effluent.  <em>See</em> 599 F.2d 151, 167-168.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Eutrophication is the natural process by which the nutrient concentration in a body of water gradually increases.

S. 334</a></span>, does not advance its argument.  Whether interstate in nature or not, if a dispute implicates "Commerce . . . among the several States," Congress is authorized to enact the substantive federal law governing the dispute.  Although the Court has formulated "interstate common law," <em>Kansas v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/46/case.html">206 U. S. 46</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/46/case.html#98">206 U. S. 98</a></span> (1907), it has done so not because the usual separation of powers principles do not apply, but rather because interstate disputes frequently call for the application of a federal rule when Congress has not spoken.  When Congress has spoken, its decision controls, even in the context of interstate disputes.  <em>See Arizona v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/546/case.html">373 U.

Simply because the opinion in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee</em> used the term "preemption," usually employed in determining if federal law displaces state law, is no reason to assume the analysis used to decide the usual federal-state questions is appropriate here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent considers the Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 "broad and systematic," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#338">451 U.

This ignores Congress\' view that the previous legislation was "inadequate in every vital aspect," 2 Leg.Hist. 1425, and Congress\' clear intent, witnessed by the statements and citations in the text, to do something quite different with the 1972 Amendments.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>"Point source" is defined in \xc2\xa7 502(14) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362(14) (1976 ed., Supp. III), as "any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance . . . from which pollutants are or may be discharged."  There is no question that all of the discharges involved in this case are point source discharges.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The most casual perusal of the legislative history demonstrates that these views on the comprehensive nature of the legislation were practically universal.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 1 Leg.Hist. 343 (Rep.

While Congress recognized a role for the States, the comprehensive nature of its action suggests that it was the exclusive source of <em>federal law.</em> Cases recognizing that the comprehensive character of a federal program is an insufficient basis to find preemption of state law are not in point, since we are considering which branch of the Federal Government is the source of federal law, not whether that law preempts state law, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#316">451 U.

Since federal courts create federal common law only as a necessary expedient when problems requiring federal answers are not addressed by federal statutory law, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#312">451 U. S. 312</a></span>-315, the comprehensive character of a federal statute is quite relevant to the present question, while it would not be were the question whether state law, which of course does not depend upon the absence of an applicable Act of Congress, still applied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The regulatory approach of the DNR to overflows reflected in these permit conditions was not plucked out of thin air, but rather followed the approach in EPA regulations, issued pursuant to the Act, governing the availability of federal funds for treatment works construction, including construction of facilities to control sewer overflows.  The regulations provide, as do the permits, for detailed evaluation of feasibility, engineering alternatives, and costs prior to the commencement of a particular construction project.  <em>See</em> 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 35.903, 35.917 (1980).  The "facilities planning" referred to in the permits for control of combined sewer overflows is a term of art defined in exhaustive detail in the EPA regulations, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 35.917-35.917-9.  Such facilities planning constitutes the first step in qualifying for federal financial assistance for construction projects.  It was the statutorily articulated intent of Congress to make funds available, subject to certain conditions, for projects to control overflows, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 201(g)(1), 212(2)(A), (B), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1281(g)(1), 1292(2)(A), (B) (1976 ed. and Supp. III); <em>see also</em> S.Rep. No. 92-414, pp. 40-41 (1971), 2 Leg.Hist. 1458-1459; 1 <em>id.</em> at 165 (Sen. Muskie); 2 <em>id.</em> at 1379 (Sen. Magnuson).  We are not impressed with arguments that more in the way of immediate solutions should have been required of the dischargers when such requirements may have had the effect, under EPA regulations requiring exhaustive planning and examination of alternatives, of foreclosing recourse to funds Congress intended to be available.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of this conclusion we need not consider petitioners\' argument that, assuming the availability of a cause of action, the lower courts erred in concluding that respondents\' evidence sufficed to establish the existence of a nuisance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> EPA, Benefit Analysis for Combined Sewer Overflow Control 4 (1979) ("regulations governing combined sewer overflows require permits for each outfall . . . they differ from the . . . permits for treatment plants, which specify effluent limitations based on technology or water quality standards.  NPDES permits for combined sewer overflows contain no effluent limitations, though they do usually require monitoring and data collection").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The point is perhaps made most clear if one asks what inadequacy in the treatment by Congress the courts below rectified through creation of federal common law.  In imposing stricter effluent limitations, the District Court was not "filling a gap" in the regulatory scheme, it was simply providing a different regulatory scheme.  The same is true with overflows.  The District Court simply ordered planning and construction designed to achieve more stringent control of overflows than the planning and construction undertaken pursuant to the permits.  The same point is evident in examining respondents\' arguments.  The basic complaint is that the permits issued to petitioners under the Act do not control overflows or treated discharges in a sufficiently stringent manner, not that permits under the Act cannot deal with these subjects or that the instant permits do not do so.  At most, respondents argue not that the Act is inadequate, as was the legislation considered in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> but that these particular permits issued under it are.  This does not suffice to create an "interstice" to be filled by federal common law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>It must be noted that the legislative activity resulting in the 1972 Amendments largely occurred prior to this Court\'s decision in <em>Illinois v.

It is therefore difficult to argue that particular provisions were designed to preserve a federal common law remedy not yet recognized by this Court.</p>\n<p>The dissent cites several cases for the proposition that the federal common law nuisance remedy existed "[l]ong before" <em>Illinois v.

S. 341</a></span>-342, is misplaced.  There is nothing unusual about Congress enacting a particular provision, and taking care that this enactment, by itself, not disturb other remedies, without considering whether the rest of the Act does so or what other remedies may be available.  The fact that the language of \xc2\xa7 505(e) is repeated <em>in haec verba</em> in the citizen suit provisions of a vast array of environmental legislation, <em>see</em> <a href="#F21" name="T21">n</a> 21, <em>supra,</em> indicates that it does not reflect any considered judgment about what other remedies were previously available or continue to be available under any particular statute.  The dissent refers to our reading as "extremely strained," but the dissent, in relying on \xc2\xa7 505(e) as evidence of Congress\' intent to preserve the federal common law nuisance remedy, must read "nothing in this section" to mean "nothing in this Act."  We prefer to read the statute as written.  Congress knows how to say "nothing in this Act" when it means to, <em>see, e.g.,</em> Pub.L. 96-510, \xc2\xa7 114 (a), 94 Stat. 2795.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent states that "Senators Muskie and Hart each responded" as Senator Hart is quoted in the text.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#344">451 U.

He did not, like Senator Hart, use the phrase "other law" but rather, and of particular significance in the present context, the phrase "<em>any other acts of Congress.</em>"  This inaccuracy in the dissent appears to be of no little importance, since the dissent attaches great weight to the views of Senator Muskie, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#344">451 U.

Representative Dingell never mentioned federal common law in his question.</p>\n<p>The dissent also relies on the failure of Congress to enact, in 1977, an amendment "proposed" by Representative Aspin.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#345">451 U.

These admonitions do not even come into play, however, since the Aspin proposal was never introduced in either House of Congress; it does not even appear in the Congressional Record.  The fate of the Aspin "proposal" has, under our precedents dealing with statutory interpretation, nothing whatever to do with Congress\' intent concerning federal common law when it enacted the 1972 Amendments.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Nine years ago, in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html">406 U.

S. 333</a></p><p> Milwaukee, three other Wisconsin cities, and two sewerage commissions.  At that time, Illinois alleged that the discharge of raw and untreated sewage by these Wisconsin entities into Lake Michigan created a public nuisance for the citizens of Illinois.  The Court remitted the parties to an appropriate federal district court, "whose powers are adequate to resolve the issues."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#108">406 U.

Today, the Court decides that this 9-year judicial exercise has been just a meaningless charade, <em>cf. Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/363/case.html">409 U.

Because I believe that Congress intended no such extinction, and surely did not contemplate the result reached by the Court today, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s analysis of federal common law displacement rests, I am convinced, on a faulty assumption.  In contrasting congressional displacement of the common law with federal preemption of state law, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] the Court assumes that, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 451 U. S. 334</a></p><p> soon as Congress "addresses a question previously governed" by federal common law, "the need for such an unusual exercise of lawmaking by federal courts disappears."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">451 U. S. 314</span>.  This "automatic displacement" approach is inadequate in two respects.  It fails to reflect the unique role federal common law plays in resolving disputes between one State and the citizens or government of another.  In addition, it ignores this Court\'s frequent recognition that federal common law may complement congressional action in the fulfillment of federal policies.</p>\n<p>It is well settled that a body of federal common law has survived the decision in <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html">304 U. S. 64</a></span> (193).  <em>Erie</em> made clear that federal courts, as courts of limited jurisdiction, lack general power to formulate and impose their own rules of decision.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/case.html#78">304 U. S. 78</a></span>.  The Court, however, did not there upset, nor has it since disturbed a deeply rooted, more specialized federal common law that has arisen to effectuate federal interests embodied either in the Constitution or an Act of Congress. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Chief among the federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 451 U.

When such disputes arise, it is clear under our federal system that laws of one State cannot impose upon the sovereign rights and interests of another.  The Constitution, by Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, explicitly extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies between a State and another State or its citizens, and this Court, in equitably resolving such disputes, has developed a body of "what may not improperly be called interstate common law."  <em>Kansas v.

The right to such federal protection is a consequence of each State\'s entry into the Union and its commitment to the Constitution.  In the words of Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court:</p>\n<p>"When the States by their union made the forcible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 451 U. S. 336</a></p><p> abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done.

Thus, the Court has been called upon to pronounce common law that will fill the interstices of a pervasively federal framework, or avoid subjecting relevant federal interests to the inconsistencies in the laws of several States.  <em>Textile Workers v.

Milwaukee</em> did not create the federal common law of nuisance.  Well before this Court and Congress acted in 1972, there was ample recognition of and foundation for a federal common law of nuisance applicable to Illinois\' situation. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Congress cannot be presumed to have been unaware of the relevant common law history, any more than it can be deemed to have been oblivious to the decision in <em>Illinois v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 451 U. S. 338</a></p><p> <em>Milwaukee,</em> announced six months prior to the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Act or Amendments), 86 Stat. 16.  The central question is whether, given its presumed awareness, Congress, in passing these Amendments, intended to prevent recourse to the federal common law of nuisance.</p>\n<p>The answer to this question, it seems to me, requires a more thorough exploration of congressional intent than is offered by the Court.  Congress had "spoken to" the particular problem of interstate water pollution as far back as 1888, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and in 1948 did so in a broad and systematic fashion with the enactment of the Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> the Court properly regarded such expressions of congressional intent as not an obstacle, but an incentive, to application of the federal common law.  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#102">406 U. S. 102</a></span>-103.  The fact that Congress, in 1972, once again addressed the complicated and difficult problem of purifying our Nation\'s waters should not be taken as presumptive evidence, let alone conclusive proof, that Congress meant to foreclose preexisting approaches to controlling interstate water pollution. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Where the possible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 451 U. S. 339</a></p><p> extinction, of federal common law is at issue, a reviewing court is obligated to look not only to the magnitude of the legislative action, but also with some care to the evidence of specific congressional intent. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, the language and structure of the Clean Water Act leave no doubt that Congress intended to preserve the federal common law of nuisance.  Section 505(e) of the Act reads:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have <em>under any statute or common law</em> to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation <em>or to seek any other relief</em> (including relief against the Administrator or a State agency)."</p>\n<p>33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365(e) (emphasis added).  The Act specifically defines "person" to include States, and thus embraces respondents Illinois and Michigan.  \xc2\xa7 502(5), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 451 U. S. 340</a></p><p> 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1362(5).  It preserves their right to bring an action against the governmental entities who are charged with enforcing the statute.  Most important, as succinctly stated by the Court of Appeals in this case:  "There is nothing in the phrase <em>any statute or common law\' that suggests that this provision is limited to state common law."  599 F.2d at 163.  To the best of my knowledge, every federal court that has considered the issue has concluded that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 505(e), Congress meant to preserve federal, as well as state, common law. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Other sections of the Clean Water Act also support the conclusion that Congress, in 1972, had no intention of extinguishing the federal common law of nuisance.  Although the Act established a detailed and comprehensive regulatory system aimed at eliminating the discharge of pollutants into all navigable waters, it did not purport to impose a unitary enforcement structure for abating water pollution.  In particular, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 451 U. S. 341</a></p><p> Congress expressly provided that the effluent limitations promulgated under the Act do not preclude any State from establishing more stringent limitations.  \xc2\xa7 510, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1370.  It also made clear that federal officers or agencies are not foreclosed from adopting or enforcing stricter pollution controls and standards than those required by the Act.  \xc2\xa7 511(a), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1371(a).</p>\n<p>Thus, under the statutory scheme, any permit issued by the EPA or a qualifying state agency does not insulate a discharger from liability under other federal or state law. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  To the contrary, the permit granted pursuant to \xc2\xa7 402(k), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342(k), confers assurances with respect to certain specified sections of the Act, but the requirements under other provisions, as well as separate legal obligations, remain unaffected.  <em>See EPA v. State Water Resources Control Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/200/case.html">426 U.

Congress plainly anticipated that dischargers might be required to meet standards more stringent than the minimum effluent levels approved by the EPA.  Those more stringent standards would necessarily be established by other statutes or by common law.  Because the Act contemplates a shared authority between the Federal Government and the individual States, <em>see, e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 101(b), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251(b) (1976 ed., Supp. III), it is entirely understandable that Congress thought it neither imperative nor desirable to insist upon an exclusive approach to the improvement of water quality. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court offers three responses to this view of congressional intent.  With regard to the language of \xc2\xa7 55(e), it attributes critical significance to the words "this section," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 451 U. S. 342</a></p><p> and concludes that Congress meant only to assure that the <em>citizen suit</em> provision did not extinguish formerly available federal common law actions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#328">451 U. S. 328</a></span>-330.  The Court thus reads \xc2\xa7 505(e) as though Congress had said that "<em>this section\' does not take away any preexisting remedies, but the remainder of the statute does."  This is an extremely strained reading of the statutory language, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] and one that is at odds with the manifest intent of Congress to permit more stringent remedies under both federal and state law.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 510, 511, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1370, 1371.  If \xc2\xa7 505(e) is to be construed as the Court suggests, then it authorizes the abrogation of all preexisting rights, both statutory and common law, in the area of water pollution control.  The Court\'s construction therefore, would render suspect, if not meaningless, the Act\'s other provisions.  Rather than interpreting \xc2\xa7 505(e) as a license to supplant all legal remedies outside the Act itself, I would construe the reference to "this section" as simply preventing preexisting rights of action from being subjected to the procedural and jurisdictional limitations imposed by \xc2\xa7 505 on persons who would sue under the Act.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court also relies on certain language contained in the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#317">451 U. S. 317</a></span>-319.  Based on the remarks of several of the Act\'s proponents that this was the most comprehensive water pollution bill prepared to date, the Court finds a strong congressional suggestion that there is no room for improvement through the federal common law.  But there is nothing talismanic about such generalized references.  The fact that legislators may characterize their efforts as more "comprehensive" than prior legislation hardly prevents them from authorizing the continued existence of supplemental legal and equitable solutions to the broad and serious problem addressed. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Moreover, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="343">Page 451 U. S. 343</a></p><p> the Court ignores express statements of legislative intent that contradict its position.  The Senate Report accompanying the 1972 legislation explicitly describes the congressional intent informing \xc2\xa7 505(e):</p>\n<p>"It should be noted, however, that the section would specifically preserve any rights or remedies under any other law.  Thus, if damages could be shown, other remedies would remain available.  Compliance with requirements under this Act would not be a defense to a common law action for pollution damages."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-414, p. 81 (1971), reprinted in 2 Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-1, p. 1499 (1973) (Leg.Hist.). [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>This deliberate preservation of all remedies previously available at common law makes no distinction between the common law of individual States and federal common law.  Indeed, the legislative debates indicate that Congress was specifically aware of the presence of federal common law, and intended that it would survive passage of the 1972 Amendments.  In one particularly revealing colloquy on the Senate floor, Senator Griffin noted the pendency of a suit challenging the dumping of iron ore pollutants into Lake </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 451 U. S. 344</a></p><p> Superior.  1 Leg.Hist.191.  <em>See Reserve Mining Co. v. EPA,</em> 514 F.2d 492 (CA8 1975) (en banc).  The Senator inquired whether the suit, which was based in part on the federal common law of nuisance, [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] would be affected by passage of the 1972 Amendments.  Senators Muskie [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] and Hart each responded that the new legislation would not affect or hinder</p>\n<p>"the suit now pending against the Reserve Mining Co., under the Refuse Act of 1899 . . . [,] the existing Federal Water Pollution Control Act or <em>other law.</em>  1 Leg.Hist. 211 (Sen. Hart) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 451 U. S. 345</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, the Court attaches significance to the fact that the 1972 Amendments provided a more rigorous administrative mechanism for addressing interstate controversies.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#325">451 U. S. 325</a></span>-326.  The Court evidently regards the provision of a new administrative abatement process as a type of jurisdictional requirement, for it criticizes Illinois\' failure to invoke the mechanism before seeking any form of judicial relief.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#326">451 U. S. 326</a></span>.  Even if this were the case, the new notice and hearing procedure became available only two years after Illinois commenced this action.  There is no suggestion that Illinois failed to pursue administrative abatement under the then-applicable federal statute.  Indeed, it is undisputed that Illinois made prolonged and diligent efforts to secure administrative relief. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Nonetheless, the Court, in effect, concludes that it is not enough to exhaust administrative remedies that existed at the time a common law action was initiated; a complainant must also be prepared to pursue new and wholly unforeseen administrative avenues even as it seeks a final judgment in federal court.  I am aware of no case that adopts so harsh an approach to the pursuit of administrative remedies, and I see no basis for imposing such a requirement in this context.</p>\n<p>Moreover, contrary to what the Court implies, Congress never intended that failure to participate in the \xc2\xa7 402 administrative process would serve as a jurisdictional bar.  Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa7 402 suggests that a neighboring State\'s participation in the permit-granting process is anything other than voluntary and optional. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Indeed, the Conference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 451 U. S. 346</a></p><p> Committee considering the 1977 amendments to the Act was presented with a proposal that <em>would</em> have made such participation a jurisdictional prerequisite. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  This proposal was not adopted by the Conference Committee, and among its opponents was the Department of Justice.  In a letter sent to all conferees, the Department made clear its understanding that, absent such an amendment, the federal common law would continue to be relied upon in the national effort to control water pollution. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 451 U. S. 347</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Justice Department\'s position on the survival of federal common law is consistent with the stance taken by the EPA both in this litigation and throughout the period since the 1972 Amendments were enacted.  The EPA in fact has relied upon the federal common law of nuisance, in addition to the remedies available under the statute, in seeking to protect water quality. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  As the agency charged with enforcing and implementing the Act, EPA\'s interpretation of the scope and limits of that statute is entitled to considerable deference.  <em>See Udall v. Tallman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/1/case.html">380 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/1/case.html#16">380 U. S. 16</a></span> (1965).  Where, as here, the agency has publicly and consistently acted upon it interpretation, congressional silence is not without significance, particularly since this area has been a subject of frequent and intense legislative attention.  And where, as here, the agency\'s continued reliance on federal common law is firmly grounded in the language and structure of the statute, I fail to see how the Court can so lightly disregard its interpretation. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 451 U. S. 348</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Assuming that Congress did preserve a federal common law of nuisance, and that respondents properly stated federal common law claims for relief, there remains the question whether the particular common law applied here was reasonable.  Because of its ruling, the Court does not explicitly address this question.  Nonetheless, in its detailed review of respondents\' claims, the Court in effect concludes that the federal common law applied by the District Court and the Court of Appeals was defective.  In particular, the Court asserts that federal courts may not exceed the statutory minimum approach sanctioned by Congress, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#323">451 U. S. 323</a></span>, and may not use federal power to impose a State\'s more stringent pollution limitation standards upon out-of-state polluters.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#327">451 U. S. 327</a></span>-328.  In contrast, I believe the courts below acted correctly in both respects.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals properly recognized, 599 F.2d at 164, the determination by Congress to preserve rights of action at federal common law did not grant federal courts the freedom to disregard the statutory and regulatory structure approved by Congress.  We noted in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee</em> that</p>\n<p>"the various federal environmental protection statutes will not necessarily mark the outer bounds of the federal common law, [but] they may provide useful guidelines in fashioning such rules of decision."</p>\n<p>406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#103">406 U. S. 103</a></span>, n. 5.  These guidelines, however, bear primarily on the problems of proof faced by the parties; they do not determine the exclusive source of the law to be applied.</p>\n<p>In this instance, problems of proof arise under a familiar form of common law action.  A public nuisance involves unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  Drawing on the Court\'s decision in <em>Georgia v. Tennessee</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 451 U. S. 349</a></p><p> <em>Copper Co.,</em> 206 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/case.html#238">206 U. S. 238</a></span>-239, the Court of Appeals concluded that nuisance is established at federal common law only if "the defendant is carrying on an activity that is causing an injury or significant threat of injury to some cognizable interest of the complainant."  599 F.2d at 165.  Whether a particular interference qualifies as unreasonable, whether the injury is sufficiently substantial to warrant injunctive relief, and what form that relief should take are questions to be decided on the basis of particular facts and circumstances. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  The judgments at times are difficult, but they do not require courts to perform functions beyond their traditional capacities or experience. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>When choosing the precise legal principles to apply, common law courts draw upon relevant standards of conduct available in their communities.  Where federal common law is concerned, "th[is] choice of law task is a federal task for federal courts."  <em>United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co.,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/580/case.html#592">412 U. S. 592</a></span>.  At the same time, while federal law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 451 U. S. 350</a></p><p> controls a particular question or problem, state law may furnish an appropriate measure of the content of this federal law.  <em>See, e.g., Board of Comm\'rs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/343/case.html">308 U. S. 343</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/343/case.html#349">308 U. S. 349</a></span>-352 (1939).  <em>See also Textile Workers v.

What the Court today characterizes as the inappropriate application of more stringent standards from Illinois state law in fact reflects a federal common law court\'s proper exercise of choice of law discretion. [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>The Act sets forth certain effluent limitations.  As did the Court of Appeals, [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>] a court applying federal common law in a given instance may well decline to impose effluent limitations more stringent than those required by Congress, because the complainant has failed to show that stricter standards will abate the nuisance or appreciably diminish the threat of injury.  But it is a far different proposition to pronounce, as does the Court today, that federal courts "<em>lack authority</em> to impose more stringent effluent limitations under federal common law than those imposed" under the statutory scheme.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#320">451 U. S. 320</a></span> (emphasis added).  The authority of the federal courts in this area was firmly established by the decision in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee.</em>  In delineating the legitimate scope of the federal common law, the Court there expressly noted the relevance of state standards, adding that "a State with high water quality standards <em>may well ask that its strict standards be honored, and that it not be compelled to lower itself</em> to the more degrading standards of a neighbor."  (Emphasis added.)  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#107">406 U. S. 107</a></span>.  The Act attributes comparable respect to the stricter effluent limitation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 451 U. S. 351</a></p><p> levels imposed by individual States.  \xc2\xa7 510, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1370.  Since both the Court and Congress fully expected that neighboring States might differ in their approaches to the regulation of the discharge of pollutants into their navigable waters, it is odd, to say the least, that federal courts should now be deprived of the common law power to effect a reconciliation of these differences.</p>\n<p>The problem of controlling overflows is particularly amenable to application of this common law authority.  As the courts below found, <em>see</em> 599 F.2d at 167-168, the sewer systems operated by petitioners include some 239 bypass or overflow points from which raw sewage is discharged directly into Lake Michigan or into rivers that flow into the lake.  In a single month in 1976, discharge from 11 of the 239 discrete overflow points amounted to some 646 million gallons of untreated sewage.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The trial court determined that these untreated fecal wastes, containing billions of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, are periodically transported by prevailing currents into the Illinois waters of Lake Michigan.  The court further found that the presence of these pathogens in Illinois waters poses a significant risk of injury to Illinois residents, threatening to contaminate drinking water supplies and infect swimmers. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the Act, publicly owned treatment works then in existence must apply "secondary treatment as defined by the Administrator" as of July 1, 1977.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 301(b)(1)(B), 304(d)(1), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1311(b)(1)(B), 1314(d)(1). [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 451 U. S. 352</a></p><p> No provision of the Act explicitly addresses the discharge of raw sewage into public waters from overflow points.  Indeed, Congress, in 1977, expressed concern that combined sewer overflows were a significant source of untreated sewage polluting the Nation\'s waters, and it commissioned a study of the problem with a view toward possible further legislation. [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>]  While the Administrator has issued regulations that define secondary treatment in terms of certain minimum levels of effluent quality, he also has acknowledged that combined sewer overflows raise special concerns that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  This record demonstrates that both Congress and the Administrator recognized the inadequacy of the statutory scheme.  It surely does not show that these responsible parties intended no role for the federal common law.</p>\n<p>The lower courts in this case carefully evaluated the regulatory systems developed by each State to deal with the overflow problem.  It was determined that the standards promulgated under the Illinois regulatory scheme were more stringent than those developed by the Wisconsin agency or imposed on petitioners under the Wisconsin state court judgment.  <em>See</em> 599 F.2d at 171-173.  The District Court\'s order imposed standards that reflected the more rigorous approach adopted in Illinois to restore and protect Illinois </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 451 U. S. 353</a></p><p> waters. [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]  The Court of Appeals noted that Wisconsin had allowed petitioners more time in which to eliminate or "correct" the overflow problem, but that petitioners conceded the feasibility of complying with the District Court\'s deadlines.  <em>Id.</em> at 172, 177.  In my view, the Court of Appeals acted responsibly, and in a manner wholly consistent with the common law jurisdiction envisioned by the Court in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is one final disturbing aspect to the Court\'s decision.  By eliminating t.he federal common law of nuisance in this area, the Court in effect is encouraging recourse to state law wherever the federal statutory scheme is perceived to offer inadequate protection against pollution from outside the State, either in its enforcement standards or in the remedies afforded.  This recourse is now inevitable under a statutory scheme that accords a significant role to state, as well as federal, law.  But in the present context, it is also unfortunate, since it undermines the Court\'s prior conclusion that it is federal, rather than state, law that should govern the regulation of interstate water pollution.  <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> 406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#102">406 U. S. 102</a></span>.  Instead of promoting a more uniform federal approach to the problem of alleviating interstate pollution, I fear that today\'s decision will lead States to turn to their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 451 U. S. 354</a></p><p> own courts for statutory or common law assistance in filling the interstices of the federal statute.  Rather than encourage such a prospect, I would adhere to the principles clearly enunciated in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court\'s decision was issued April 24, 1972.  The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 19, 1972.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>I have no quarrel with the Court\'s distinction between the issues of federalism at stake in assessing congressional preemption of state law and the separation of powers concerns that are implicated here.  But there is more to this distinction than the Court suggests.  In deciding whether federal law preempts state law, the Court must be sensitive to the potential frustration of national purposes if the States are permitted to control conduct that is the subject of federal regulation.  <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html#244">359 U. S. 244</a></span> (1959).  <em>See Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

S. 142</a></span> (1963).  For this reason, in preemption analysis, the role of federal law is often determined on an "all or nothing" basis.  On the other hand, where federal interests alone are at stake, participation by the federal courts is often desirable, and indeed necessary, if federal policies developed by Congress are to be fully effectuated.  <em>See, e.g., Miree v. DeKalb County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/25/case.html">433 U.

Pankey,</em> 441 F.2d 236 (CA10 1971).  As recently as 1971, however, the Court had confirmed the existence of its original jurisdiction to consider a nuisance action brought by one State to vindicate its own sovereign interests or the interests of its citizens as a whole.  <em>See Ohio v.

California,</em> Congress had developed a formula for apportioning the limited waters of the Colorado River and directed the federal agency to implement the formula.  In the face of this express congressional allocation, the Court declined to substitute its own notions of an equitable apportionment.  373 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/546/case.html#565">373 U. S. 565</a></span>.  In <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,</em> the Court confronted a statute that had created a precise federal remedy where before there had been none.  Since federal law, when the statute was passed, did not address wrongful death on the high seas, and the statute itself expressed no intent to preserve or create federal remedies, the Court acceded to the particularized judgment of Congress.  436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/case.html#625">436 U.

Unlike the statutes at issue in those two cases, the 1972 Act addressed a broad and complex subject to which state and federal law had previously spoken, and, in doing so, recognized and encouraged many different approaches to controlling water pollution.  <em>See</em> discussion in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#339">451 U.

Congress, of course, may resolve this tension by making it known that flexible and creative judicial response on a case-by-case basis must yield to an interest in certainty under a comprehensive legislative scheme.  At the same time, the fact that Congress can properly check the courts\' exercise of federal common law does not mean that it has done so in a specific case.  This Court is no more free to disregard expressions of legislative desire to preserve federal common law than it is to overlook congressional intent to curtail it.  Indeed, the Court has admonished that statutes will not be construed in derogation of the common law unless such an intent is clear.  <em>Isbrandtsen Co. v.

Indeed, the court there assumed the continued applicability of federal common law where a State sought to vindicate its rights in an interstate controversy, 539 F.2d at 1010, but concluded that, because the controversy was entirely local, the state common law of nuisance preserved by \xc2\xa7 505(e) furnished the relevant common law remedy.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf.

In seeking assurances that the pending litigation would not be "adversely affect[ed]," Senator Griffin stated explicitly that the lawsuit was based on two preexisting federal statutes and the common law of public nuisance.  1 Leg.Hist.190-191.  Senator Muskie\'s final response to Senator Griffin indicated his understanding that the suit as a whole would not be affected by the Act.  <em>Id.</em> at 194.  Moreover, Senator Hart\'s reference to "other law" in the <em>Reserve Mining</em> case could have pertained only to the common law counts he had not already mentioned.</p>\n<p>This entire discussion of the <em>Reserve Mining</em> case was initiated due to Senator Griffin\'s concern over the possible retroactive effect of \xc2\xa7 402(k) on litigation already commenced.  Senators Muskie and Hart, as well as the EPA, took the position that there would be no disruption of the pending action, which had been commenced in February, 1972, three months prior to this action.  In his letter to Senator Griffin, the EPA General Counsel added a caveat that has obvious significance here:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is reasonable to conclude that the courts will not interpret any legislation to deprive them of jurisdiction of pending litigation in the absence of clear and explicit language.

This is a sound principle.  Where it can be shown that pollution has injured someone, it should not be a sufficient defense to claim that the generalized standards of a statute have been complied with.  Polluters should properly be held to a standard that holds them liable for unnecessarily injuring others, and not simply for violating the statutory law.
