GEORGIA<br/>\n558 U. S. ____ (2010)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ERIC PRESLEY <em>v.</em> GEORGIA</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of georgia</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x935270.\xe2\x80\x83Decided January 19, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a jury trial in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, petitioner Eric Presley was convicted of a cocaine trafficking offense.  The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia.  285 Ga. 270, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 909 (2009).  Presley seeks certiorari, claiming his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a public trial was violated when the trial court excluded the public from the <em>voir dire</em> of prospective jurors.  The Supreme Court of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance contravened this Court\xe2\x80\x99s clear precedents.  Certiorari and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are now granted, and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before selecting a jury in Presley\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the trial court noticed a lone courtroom observer.  <em>Id.,</em> at 270\xe2\x80\x93271, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 910.  The court explained that prospective jurors were about to enter and instructed the man that he was not allowed in the courtroom and had to leave that floor of the courthouse entirely.  <em>Id.,</em> at 271, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 910.  The court then questioned the man and learned\nhe was Presley\xe2\x80\x99s uncle.  <em>Ibid. </em> The court reiterated its instruction:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Well, you still can\xe2\x80\x99t sit out in the audience with the jurors.  You know, most of the afternoon actually we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be picking a jury.  And we may have a couple of pre-trial matters, so you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to come in after we \xe2\x80\xa6 complete selecting the jury this afternoon.  But, otherwise, you would have to leave the sixth floor, because jurors will be all out in the hallway in a few moments.  That applies to everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s got a case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\nPresley\xe2\x80\x99s counsel objected to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the exclusion of the public from the courtroom,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]here just isn\xe2\x80\x99t space for them to sit in the audience.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  When Presley\xe2\x80\x99s counsel requested \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some accommodation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained its ruling further:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Well, the uncle can certainly come back in once the trial starts.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no, really no need for the uncle to be present during jury selection\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [W]e have 42 jurors coming up.  Each of those rows will be occupied by jurors.  And his uncle cannot sit and intermingle with members of the jury panel.  But, when the trial starts, the opening statements and other matters, he can certainly come back into the courtroom.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Presley was convicted, he moved for a new trial based on the exclusion of the public from the juror <em>voir dire</em>.  At a hearing on the motion, Presley presented evidence showing that 14 prospective jurors could have fit in the jury box and the remaining 28 could have fit entirely on one side of the courtroom, leaving adequate room for the public.  App. to Pet. for Cert. E\xe2\x80\x9337, E\xe2\x80\x9341.  The trial court denied the motion, commenting that it preferred to seat jurors throughout the entirety of the courtroom, and \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s up to the individual judge to decide . . . what\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> E\xe2\x80\x9338.  The court continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s totally up to my discretion whether or not I want family members in the courtroom to intermingle with the jurors and sit directly behind the jurors where they might overhear some inadvertent comment or conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at E\xe2\x80\x9342 to E\xe2\x80\x9343.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Georgia agreed, finding \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was no abuse of discretion here, when the trial court explained the need to exclude spectators at the voir dire stage of the proceedings and when members of the public were invited to return afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d  290 Ga. App. 99, 100\xe2\x80\x93101, 658 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 773, 775 (2008).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supreme Court of Georgia granted certiorari and affirmed, with two justices dissenting.  After finding \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court certainly had an overriding interest in ensuring that potential jurors heard no inherently prejudicial remarks from observers during voir dire,\xe2\x80\x9d the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected Presley\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the trial court was required to consider alternatives to closing the courtroom.  285 Ga., at 272, 273, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 911.  It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States Supreme Court [has] not provide[d] clear guidance regarding whether a court must, sU. S.onte, advance its own alternatives to [closure],\xe2\x80\x9d and the court ruled that \xe2\x80\x9cPresley was obliged to present the court with any alternatives that he wished the court to consider.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 273, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 911, 912.  When no alternatives are offered, it concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no abuse of discretion in the court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to sU. S.onte advance its own alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 274, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 912.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings with respect to the public trial right rest upon two different provisions of the Bill of Rights, both applicable to the States via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Sixth Amendment directs, in relevant part, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Oliver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/257/index.html">333 U. S. 257</a>, 273 (1948), made it clear that this right extends to the States.  The Sixth Amendment right, as the quoted language makes explicit, is the right of the accused.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has further held that the public trial right extends beyond the accused and can be invoked under the First Amendment.  <em>Press-Enterprise Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/index.html">464 U. S. 501</a> (1984) <em>(Press-Enterprise I)</em>.  This requirement, too, is binding on the States.  <em>Ibid. </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The case now before the Court is brought under the Sixth Amendment, for it is the accused who invoked his right to a public trial.  An initial question is whether the right to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury selection phase of trial, and in particular the <em>voir dire </em>of prospective jurors.  In the First Amendment context that question was answered in <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>.  <em>Id.</em>, at 510.  The Court there held that the <em>voir dire</em> of prospective jurors must be open to the public under the First Amendment.  Later in the same Term as <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>, the Court considered a Sixth Amendment case concerning whether the public trial right extends to a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress certain evidence.  <em>Waller</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/39/index.html">467 U. S. 39</a> (1984).  The <em>Waller </em>Court relied heavily upon <em>Press-Enterprise I </em>in finding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends beyond the actual proof at trial.  It ruled that the pretrial suppression hearing must be open to the public because \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 46.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While <em>Press-Enterprise I </em>was heavily relied upon in <em>Waller</em>, the jury selection issue in the former case was resolved under the First, not the Sixth, Amendment.  <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 516 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe constitutional protection for the right of access that the Court upholds today is found in the First Amendment, rather than the public trial provision of the Sixth\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  In the instant case, the question then arises whether it is so well settled that the Sixth Amendment right extends to jury <em>voir dire</em> that this Court may proceed by summary disposition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point is well settled under <em>Press-Enterprise I </em>and <em>Waller</em>.  The extent to which the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive is an open question, and it is not necessary here to speculate whether or in what circumstances the reach or protections of one might be greater than the other.  Still, there is no legitimate reason, at least in the context of juror selection proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings than the accused has.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur cases have uniformly recognized the public-trial guarantee as one created for the benefit of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gannett Co.</em> v. <em>DePasquale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/index.html">443 U. S. 368</a>, 380 (1979).  There could be no explanation for barring the accused from raising a constitutional right that is unmistakably for his or her benefit.  That rationale suffices to resolve the instant matter.  The Supreme Court of Georgia was correct in assuming that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to the <em>voir dire</em> of prospective jurors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the accused does have a right to insist that the <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors be public, there are exceptions to this general rule.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to a fair trial or the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Waller, </em>467 U. S.<em>,</em> at 45.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuch circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  Waller</em> provided standards for courts to apply before excluding the public from any stage of a criminal trial: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 48.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In upholding exclusion of the public at juror <em>voir dire</em> in the instant case, the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded, despite our explicit statements to the contrary, that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of some alternatives.  While the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded this was an open question under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, the statement in <em>Waller </em>that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d settles the point.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If that statement leaves any room for doubt, the Court was more explicit in <em>Press-Enterprise I:</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cEven with findings adequate to support closure, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s orders denying access to <em>voir dire </em>testimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s orders sought to guard.  Absent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally close the <em>voir dire</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  464 U. S.<em>, </em>at 511.  </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties is clear not only from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents but also from the premise that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he process of juror selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply to the adversaries but to the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 505.  The public has a right to be present whether or not any party has asserted the right.  In <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>, for instance, neither the defendant nor the prosecution requested an open courtroom during juror <em>voir dire</em> proceedings; in fact, both specifically argued in favor of keeping the transcript of the proceedings confidential.  <em>Id.,</em> at 503\xe2\x80\x93504.  The Court, nonetheless, found it was error to close the courtroom.  <em>Id.,</em> at 513.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Trial courts are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal trials. Nothing in the record shows that the trial court could not have accommodated the public at Presley\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Without knowing the precise circumstances, some possibilities include reserving one or more rows for the public; dividing the jury venire panel to reduce courtroom congestion; or instructing prospective jurors not to engage or interact with audience members.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner also argues that, apart from failing to consider alternatives to closure, the trial court erred because it did not even identify any overriding interest likely to be prejudiced absent the closure of <em>voir dire</em>.  There is some merit to this complaint.  The generic risk of jurors overhearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are present during the selection of jurors.  If broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course.  As noted in the dissent below, \xe2\x80\x9cthe majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning permits the closure of voir dire in <em>every criminal case </em>conducted in this courtroom whenever the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or she would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors rather than spectators.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 Ga., at 276, 674 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 913 (opinion of Sears, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are no doubt circumstances where a judge could conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closing <em>voir dire</em>.  But in those cases, the particular interest, and threat to that interest, must \xe2\x80\x9cbe articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Press-Enterprise I, supra, </em>at 510; see also <em>Press-Enterprise Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/index.html">478 U. S. 1</a>, 15 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment right of access cannot be overcome by the conclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of [the right to a fair trial]\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not rule on this second claim of error, because even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>,<em> </em>that the trial court had an overriding interest in closing <em>voir dire</em>, it was still incumbent upon it to consider all reasonable alternatives to closure.  It did not, and that is all this Court needs to decide. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supreme Court of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.     </p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963079">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nPRESLEY V.

S. 39</a> (1984), and <em>Press-Enterprise Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/index.html">464 U. S. 501</a> (1984) <em>(Press-Enterprise I)</em>.  I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s summary disposition of these important questions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court addresses \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it is so well settled that [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] Sixth Amendment right\xe2\x80\x9d to a public trial \xe2\x80\x9cextends to jury <em>voir dire</em> that this Court may proceed by summary disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative answer to this question relies exclusively on <em>Waller </em>and <em>Press-Enterprise I;</em> but those cases cannot bear the weight of this answer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court correctly notes that <em>Waller</em> answers whether a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial applies to a suppression hearing\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>(not to jury <em>voir dire</em>), 467 U. S., at 43, and that <em>Press-Enterprise I</em> interprets the <em>public\xe2\x80\x99s</em> First Amendment right to attend jury <em>voir dire</em>, 464 U. S., at 509, n.\xc2\xa08, so neither <em>Waller</em> nor <em>Press-Enterprise I </em>expressly answers the question here, see <em>ante</em>, at 4.  That acknowledgment should have eliminated any basis for disposing of this case summarily; the Court should reserve that procedural option for cases that our precedents govern squarely and directly.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Haley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/644/index.html">358 U. S. 644</a> (1959) <em>(per curiam)</em> (summarily reversing a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that refused to follow, or even mention, one of our precedents upholding the statute in issue under identical circumstances).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nevertheless concludes that <em>Waller</em> and <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>\xe2\x80\x94in combination\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell settl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  It<em> </em>admits that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he extent to which the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive is an open question,\xe2\x80\x9d but, apparently extrapolating from <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>, asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no legitimate reason, at least in the context of juror selection proceedings, to give one who asserts a First Amendment privilege greater rights to insist on public proceedings than the accused has.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But this conclusion decides by implication an unstated premise: that jury <em>voir dire </em>is part of the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic trial\xe2\x80\x9d that the Sixth Amendment guarantees.  As Justice Stevens recognized in <em>Press-Enterprise I</em>, that case did not decide this issue.  See 464 U. S., at 516 (concurring opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the defendant had advanced a claim that his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated by the closure of the <em>voir dire</em>, it would be important to determine whether the selection of the jury was a part of the \xe2\x80\x98trial\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of that Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Until today, that question remained open; the majority certainly cites no other case from this Court answering it.  Yet the Court does so here\xe2\x80\x94even though the Supreme Court of Georgia did not meaningfully consider that question, and petitioner does not ask us to do so.*<footcall num="*">  I am unwilling to decide this important question summarily without the benefit of full briefing and argument.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I am also unwilling to join the Court in reading the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98alternatives to closure\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d language it quotes from <em>Waller</em> and <em>Press Enterprise I</em> as squarely foreclosing the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  The Court chides the Supreme Court of Georgia for \xe2\x80\x9cconclud[ing], despite <em>our explicit statements</em> to the contrary, that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure <em>absent an opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of some alternatives</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (emphasis added).  But neither <em>Waller </em>nor <em>Press-Enterprise I</em> expressly holds that jury <em>voir dire</em> is covered by the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[P]ublic [T]rial\xe2\x80\x9d Clause.  Accordingly, it is not obvious that the \xe2\x80\x9calternatives to closure\xe2\x80\x9d language in those opinions governs this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming the Court correctly extends <em>Waller </em>and <em>Press-Enterprise I</em> to this (Sixth Amendment <em>voir dire</em>) context, neither opinion \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d places on trial courts the burden of <em>sU. S.onte </em>suggesting alternatives to closure \xe2\x80\x9cabsent an opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s proffer of some alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 6<em>.</em>  The statement that a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Waller</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 48), does not definitively establish who must <em>suggest</em> alternatives to closure that the trial court must then <em>consider</em>, nor does it expressly address whether the trial court must suggest such alternatives in the absence of a proffer.  I concede that the language can easily be read to imply the latter, and the Court may well be right that a trial court violates the Sixth Amendment if it closes the courtroom without <em>sU.
