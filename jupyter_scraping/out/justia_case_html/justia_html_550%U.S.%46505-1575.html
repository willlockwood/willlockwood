LANDRIGAN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS <em>v</em>. LANDRIGAN aka HILL</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x931575.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 9, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 14, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Landrigan refused to allow his counsel to present the testimony of his ex-wife and birth mother as mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing for a felony-murder conviction.  He also interrupted as counsel tried to proffer other evidence, and he told the Arizona trial judge he did not wish to present any mitigating evidence and to \xe2\x80\x9cbring on\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty.  The court sentenced him to death, and the sentence was affirmed.  The state postconviction court rejected Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct further investigation into mitigating circumstances, finding that he had instructed counsel at sentencing not to present any mitigating evidence at all.  Landrigan then filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  Exercising its discretion, the District Court refused to grant him an evidentiary hearing because he could not make out even a colorable ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance fell below the standard required by <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Landrigan an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) has not changed the basic rule that the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing is left to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s sound discretion, but it has changed the standards for granting federal habeas relief by prohibiting such relief unless a state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this Court],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  Because \xc2\xa72254\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standards control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.  In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether the hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.  It follows that if the record refutes the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that, even with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, Landrigan could not develop a factual record entitling him to federal habeas relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Arizona state courts\xe2\x80\x99 findings that Landrigan had instructed his counsel not to offer any mitigating evidence took Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing colloquy out of context, amounting to an unreasonable determination of the facts.  However, the colloquy\xe2\x80\x99s language plainly indicates that Landrigan told his counsel not to present any mitigating evidence, and the record conclusively dispels the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s statements referred to only his ex-wife\xe2\x80\x99s and birth mother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  On that record, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Landrigan refused to allow the presentation of any mitigating evidence was a reasonable determination of the facts.  Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that Landrigan could not overcome \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s bar to granting federal habeas relief.  That court was entitled to conclude that regardless of what information counsel might have uncovered in his investigation, Landrigan would have interrupted and refused to allow him to present it.  Thus, it could conclude that because of his established recalcitrance, Landrigan could not demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> even if granted an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also erred in finding two alternative reasons for its holding.  It concluded that the Arizona courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s claims were frivolous and meritless was an unreasonable application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, based on the belief, derived from <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, that his last minute decision to block testimony could not excuse his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do an adequate investigation before sentencing.  However, this Court has never addressed a situation in which a client interferes with counsel\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to present mitigating evidence to a sentencing court.  Thus, it was not objectively unreasonable for the Arizona postconviction court to conclude that a defendant who refused to allow any mitigating evidence to be presented could not establish <em>Strickland</em> prejudice based on his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate further possible mitigating evidence.  The Ninth Circuit also found that the record does not indicate that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s decision was informed and knowing,<em> </em>or that he understood its consequences.  This Court has never held that an \xe2\x80\x9cinformed and knowing\xe2\x80\x9d requirement exists with respect to the decision to not introduce mitigating evidence.  But even assuming such a requirement exists in this case, Landrigan cannot benefit from it.  First, because he never developed his claim properly before the Arizona courts, \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) barred the District Court from granting an evidentiary hearing on that basis.  Second, his counsel told the sentencing court in Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s presence that he had carefully explained to Landrigan the importance of mitigating evidence in death penalty cases and his duty as counsel to disclose mitigating factors for consideration.  In light of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated propensity for interjecting himself into the proceedings, it is doubtful that he would have sat idly by while counsel lied about such discussions.  Third, it is apparent from Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the sentencing court to bring on the death penalty that he clearly understood the consequences of telling the judge that there were no relevant mitigating circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also erred in rejecting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the poor quality of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mitigating evidence prevented him from making a colorable prejudice claim.  Because most of the evidence that Landrigan now wishes to offer would have been offered by this birth mother and ex-wife had he allowed them to testify, and because the sentencing court had much of the evidence before it by way of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s proffer, the District Court could reasonably conclude that any additional evidence would have made no difference in the sentencing.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Even assuming the truth of all the facts Landrigan sought to prove at an evidentiary hearing, he still could not be granted federal habeas relief because the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual determination that he would not have allowed counsel to present any mitigating evidence at sentencing is not an unreasonable determination of the facts under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and the mitigating evidence he seeks to introduce would not have changed the result.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(e)(2), the decision to grant such a hearing rests in the discretion of the district court.  Here, the District Court determined that respondent could not make out a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and therefore was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.  It did so after reviewing the state-court record and expanding the record to include additional evidence offered by the respondent.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the hearing.  We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Jeffrey Landrigan was convicted in Oklahoma of second-degree murder in 1982.  In 1986, while in custody for that murder, Landrigan repeatedly stabbed another inmate and was subsequently convicted of assault and battery with a deadly weapon.  Three years later, Landrigan escaped from prison and murdered Chester Dean Dyer in Arizona.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An Arizona jury found Landrigan guilty of theft, second-degree burglary, and felony murder for having caused the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death in the course of a burglary.  At sentencing, Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s counsel attempted to present the testimony of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife and birth mother as mitigating evidence.  But at Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s request, both women refused to testify.  When the trial judge asked why the witnesses refused, Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s counsel responded that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s at my client\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x933.  Counsel explained that he had \xe2\x80\x9cadvised [Landrigan] very strongly that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very much against his interests to take that particular position.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court then questioned Landrigan:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Mr. Landrigan, have you instructed your lawyer that you do not wish for him to bring any mitigating circumstances to my attention?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Do you know what that means?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Mr. Landrigan, are there mitigating circumstances I should be aware of?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE DEFENDANT: Not as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at D\xe2\x80\x933, D\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still not satisfied, the trial judge directly asked the witnesses to testify.  Both refused.  The judge then asked counsel to make a proffer of the witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 testimony.  Counsel attempted to explain that the witnesses would testify that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother used drugs and alcohol (including while she was pregnant with Landrigan), that Landrigan abused drugs and alcohol, and that Landrigan had been a good father.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Landrigan would have none of it.  When counsel tried to explain that Landrigan had worked in a legitimate job to provide for his family, Landrigan interrupted and stated \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f I wanted this to be heard, I\xe2\x80\x99d have my wife say it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at D\xe2\x80\x936.  Landrigan then explained that he was not only working but also \xe2\x80\x9cdoing robberies supporting my family.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x937.  When counsel characterized Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s first murder as having elements of self-defense, Landrigan interrupted and clarified: \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t grab me.  I stabbed him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x939.  Responding to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s statement implying that the prison stabbing involved self-defense because the assaulted inmate knew Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s first murder victim, Landrigan interrupted to clarify that the inmate was not acquainted with his first victim, but just \xe2\x80\x9ca guy I got in an argument with.  I stabbed him 14 times.  It was lucky he lived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the judge asked Landrigan if he had anything to say.  Landrigan made a brief statement that concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI think if you want to give me the death penalty, just bring it right on.  I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge found two statutory aggravating circumstances: that Landrigan murdered Dyer in expectation of pecuniary gain and that Landrigan was previously convicted of two felonies involving the use or threat of violence on another person.  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x9323.  In addition, the judge found two nonstatutory mitigating circumstances: that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s family loved him and an absence of premeditation.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Finally, the trial judge stated that she considered Landrigan \xe2\x80\x9ca person who has no scruples and no regard for human life and human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Based on these findings, the court sentenced Landrigan to death.  On direct appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s sentence and conviction.  In addressing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim not relevant here, the court noted that Landrigan had stated his \xe2\x80\x9cdesire not to have mitigating evidence presented in his behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v.<em> Landrigan,</em> 176 Ariz. 1, 8, 859 P.\xc2\xa02d 111, 118 (1993).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 31, 1995, Landrigan filed a petition for state postconviction relief and alleged his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] to explore additional grounds for arguing mitigation evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. F\xe2\x80\x933 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Specifically, Landrigan maintained that his counsel should have investigated the \xe2\x80\x9cbiological component\xe2\x80\x9d of his violent behavior by interviewing his biological father and other relatives.  <em>Id</em>., at E\xe2\x80\x932.  In addition, Landrigan stated that his biological father could confirm that his biological mother used drugs and alcohol while pregnant with Landrigan.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona postconviction court, presided over by the same judge who tried and sentenced Landrigan, rejected Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[Landrigan] instructed his attorney not to present any evidence at the sentencing hearing, [so] it is difficult to comprehend how [Landrigan] can claim counsel should have presented other evidence at sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at F\xe2\x80\x934.  Noting Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s contention that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would have cooperated\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d had other mitigating evidence been presented, the court concluded that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatements at sentencing belie his new-found sense of cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Describing Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s claim as \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at F\xe2\x80\x935, the court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing and dismissed Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review on June 19, 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Landrigan then filed a federal habeas application under \xc2\xa72254.  The District Court determined, after \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[ing] the record to include \xe2\x80\xa6 evidence of [Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s] troubled background, his history of drug and alcohol abuse, and his family\xe2\x80\x99s history of criminal behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at C\xe2\x80\x9322, that Landrigan could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any error his counsel may have made.  Because Landrigan could not make out even a \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable\xe2\x80\x9d ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, <em>id</em>., at C\xe2\x80\x9346, the District Court refused to grant him an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but the full court granted rehearing en banc, <em>Landrigan</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, 397 F.\xc2\xa03d 1235 (2005), and reversed.  The en banc Court of Appeals held that Landrigan was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he raised a \xe2\x80\x9ccolorable claim\xe2\x80\x9d that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance fell below the standard required by <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  441 F.\xc2\xa03d 638, 650 (CA9 2006).  With respect to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance, the Ninth Circuit found that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid little to prepare for the sentencing aspect of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 643, and that investigation would have revealed a wealth of mitigating evidence, including the family\xe2\x80\x99s history of drug and alcohol abuse and propensity for violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to prejudice, the court held the Arizona postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Landrigan refused to permit his counsel to present any mitigating evidence was \xe2\x80\x9can \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable determination of the facts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 647 (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)).  The Court of Appeals found that when Landrigan stated that he did not want his counsel to present any mitigating evidence, he was clearly referring only to the evidence his attorney was about to introduce\xe2\x80\x94that of his ex-wife and birth mother.  441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 646.  The court further held that, even if Landrigan intended to forgo the presentation of all mitigation evidence, such a \xe2\x80\x9clast-minute decision cannot excuse his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to conduct an adequate investigation <em>prior</em> to the sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 647.  In conclusion, the court found \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, if Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are true, the sentencing judge would have reached a different conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 650.  The court therefore remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing was generally left to the sound discretion of district courts.  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/index.html">344 U. S. 443</a>, 463\xe2\x80\x93464 (1953); see also <em>Townsend</em> v. <em>Sain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/index.html">372 U. S. 293</a>, 313 (1963).  That basic rule has not changed.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, Rule 8(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he judge must review the answer [and] any transcripts and records of state-court proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AEDPA, however, changed the standards for granting federal habeas relief.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Under AEDPA, Congress prohibited federal courts from granting habeas relief unless a state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of a claim \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), or the relevant state-court decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  The question under AEDPA is not whether a federal court believes the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94a substantially higher threshold.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 410 (2000).  AEDPA also requires federal habeas courts to presume the correctness of state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings unless applicants rebut this presumption with \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Mayes</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, 210 F.\xc2\xa03d 1284, 1287 (CA10 2000).  Because the deferential standards prescribed by \xc2\xa72254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1287\xe2\x80\x931288 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether [an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s] allegations, if proven, would entitle him to habeas relief is a question governed by [AEDPA]\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows that if the record refutes the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.  The Ninth Circuit has recognized this point in other cases, holding that \xe2\x80\x9can evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can be resolved by reference to the state court record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Totten</em> v. <em>Merkle</em>, 137 F.\xc2\xa03d 1172, 1176 (1998) (emphasis deleted) (affirming the denial of an evidentiary hearing where the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations \xe2\x80\x9cfl[ew] in the face of logic in light of \xe2\x80\xa6 [the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s] deliberate acts which are easily discernible from the record\xe2\x80\x9d).  This approach is not unique to the Ninth Circuit.  See <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Attorney General of Kan.</em>, 425 F.\xc2\xa03d 853, 858\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA10 2005) (holding that no evidentiary hearing is required if the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are contravened by the existing record); cf. <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 202 F.\xc2\xa03d 760, 767 (CA5 2000) (holding that no hearing is required when the applicant has failed to present clear and convincing evidence to rebut a state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings); <em>Campbell</em> v. <em>Vaughn</em>, 209 F.\xc2\xa03d 280, 290 (CA3 2000) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This principle accords with AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledged purpose of \xe2\x80\x9creduc[ing] delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Garceau</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/202/index.html">538 U.

(\xe2\x80\x9cCongress wished to curb delays, to prevent \xe2\x80\x98retrials\xe2\x80\x99 on federal habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law\xe2\x80\x9d)).  If district courts were required to allow federal habeas applicants to develop even the most insubstantial factual allegations in evidentiary hearings, district courts would be forced to reopen factual disputes that were conclusively resolved in the state courts.  With these standards in mind, we turn to the facts of this case.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For several reasons, the Court of Appeals believed that Landrigan might be entitled to federal habeas relief and that the District Court, therefore, abused its discretion by denying Landrigan an evidentiary hearing.  To the contrary, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that, even with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, Landrigan could not develop a factual record that would entitle him to habeas relief.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals first addressed the State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Landrigan instructed his counsel not to offer any mitigating evidence.  If Landrigan issued such an instruction, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate further could not have been prejudicial under <em>Strickland</em>.  The Court of Appeals rejected the findings of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Arizona Supreme Court (on direct appeal) and the Arizona Superior Court (on habeas review)\xe2\x80\x9d that Landrigan instructed his counsel not to introduce any mitigating evidence.<em> </em>441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 646.  According to the Ninth Circuit, those findings took Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s colloquy with the sentencing court out of context in a manner that \xe2\x80\x9camounts to an \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable determination of the facts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 647 (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon review of record material and the transcripts from the state courts, we disagree.  As a threshold matter, the language of the colloquy plainly indicates that Landrigan informed his counsel not to present any mitigating evidence.  When the Arizona trial judge asked Landrigan if he had instructed his lawyer not to present mitigating evidence, Landrigan responded affirmatively.  Likewise, when asked if there was any relevant mitigating evidence, Landrigan answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNot as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x934.  These statements establish that the Arizona postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the facts was reasonable.  And it is worth noting, again, that the judge presiding on postconviction review was ideally situated to make this assessment because she is the same judge that sentenced Landrigan and discussed these issues with him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the plainness of these statements, the Court of Appeals concluded that they referred to only the specific testimony that counsel planned to offer\xe2\x80\x94that of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife and birth mother.  The Court of Appeals further concluded that Landrigan, due to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate, could not have known about the mitigating evidence he now wants to explore.  The record conclusively dispels that interpretation.  First, Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother would have offered testimony that overlaps with the evidence Landrigan now wants to present.  For example, Landrigan wants to present evidence from his biological father that would \xe2\x80\x9cconfirm [his biological mother\xe2\x80\x99s] alcohol and drug use during her pregnancy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at E\xe2\x80\x932.  But the record shows that counsel planned to call Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother to testify about her \xe2\x80\x9cdrug us[e] during her pregnancy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x9310, and the possible effects of such drug use.  Second, Landrigan interrupted repeatedly when counsel tried to proffer anything that could have been considered mitigating.  He even refused to allow his attorney to proffer that he had worked a regular job at one point.  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x936, D\xe2\x80\x937.  This behavior confirms what is plain from the transcript of the colloquy: that Landrigan would have undermined the presentation of any mitigating evidence that his attorney might have uncovered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the record before us, the Arizona court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Landrigan refused to allow the presentation of any mitigating evidence was a reasonable determination of the facts.  In this regard, we agree with the initial Court of Appeals panel that reviewed this case:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn the constellation of refusals to have mitigating evidence presented . . . this case is surely a bright star.  No other case could illuminate the state of the client\xe2\x80\x99s mind and the nature of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma quite as brightly as this one.  No flashes of insight could be more fulgurous than those which this record supplies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landrigan</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 1221, 1226 (CA9 2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Arizona postconviction court reasonably determined that Landrigan \xe2\x80\x9cinstructed his attorney not to bring any mitigation to the attention of the [sentencing] court,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. F\xe2\x80\x934, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that Landrigan could not overcome \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s bar to granting federal habeas relief.  The District Court was entitled to conclude that regardless of what information counsel might have uncovered in his investigation, Landrigan would have interrupted and refused to allow his counsel to present any such evidence.  Accordingly, the District Court could conclude that because of his established recalcitrance, Landrigan could not demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> even if granted an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals offered two alternative reasons for holding that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s inability to make a showing of prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> did not bar any potential habeas relief and, thus, an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that, even if Landrigan did not want any mitigating evidence presented, the Arizona courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s claims were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98frivolous\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98meritless\xe2\x80\x99 was an unreasonable application of United States Supreme Court precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 647 (citing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)).  This holding was founded on the belief, derived from <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a> (2003), that \xe2\x80\x9cLandrigan\xe2\x80\x99s apparently last-minute decision cannot excuse his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to conduct an adequate investigation <em>prior</em> to the sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>441 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 647.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Wiggins </em>nor <em>Strickland</em> addresses a situation in which a client interferes with counsel\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to present mitigating evidence to a sentencing court.  <em>Wiggins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 523 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e focus on whether the investigation supporting <em>counsel\xe2\x80\x99s</em> decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins\xe2\x80\x99 background was itself reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added and deleted)).  Indeed, we have never addressed a situation like this.  In <em>Rompilla</em> v. <em>Beard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/374/index.html">545 U. S. 374</a>, 381 (2005), on which the Court of Appeals also relied, the defendant refused to assist in the development of a mitigation case, but did not inform the court that he did not want mitigating evidence presented.  In short, at the time of the Arizona postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it was not objectively unreasonable for that court to conclude that a defendant who refused to allow the presentation of any mitigating evidence could not establish <em>Strickland</em> prejudice based on his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate further possible mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also stated that the record does not indicate that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to present mitigating evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cinformed and knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 647, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trial court\xe2\x80\x99s dialogue with Landrigan tells us little about his understanding of the consequences of his decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We have never imposed an \xe2\x80\x9cinformed and knowing\xe2\x80\x9d requirement upon a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to introduce evidence.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Iowa</em> v. <em>Tovar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/77/index.html">541 U. S. 77</a>, 88 (2004) (explaining that waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing and intelligent).  Even assuming, however, that an \xe2\x80\x9cinformed and knowing\xe2\x80\x9d requirement exists in this case, Landrigan cannot benefit from it, for three reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Landrigan never presented this claim to the Arizona courts.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Rather, he argued that he would have complied had other evidence been offered.  Thus, Landrigan failed to develop this claim properly before the Arizona courts, and \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) therefore barred the District Court from granting an evidentiary hearing on that basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s presence, his counsel told the sentencing court that he had carefully explained to Landrigan the importance of mitigating evidence, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially concerning the fact that the State is seeking the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x933.  Counsel also told the court that he had explained to Landrigan that as counsel, he had a duty to disclose \xe2\x80\x9cany and all mitigating factors \xe2\x80\xa6 to th[e] [c]ourt for consideration regarding the sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In light of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated propensity for interjecting himself into the proceedings, it is doubtful that Landrigan would have sat idly by while his counsel lied about having previously discussed these issues with him.  And as Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s counsel conceded at oral argument before this Court, we have never required a specific colloquy to ensure that a defendant knowingly and intelligently refused to present mitigating evidence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court of Appeals overlooked Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s final statement to the sentencing court:  \xe2\x80\x9cI think if you want to give me the death penalty, just bring it right on.  I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for it.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x9316.  It is apparent from this statement that Landrigan clearly understood the consequences of telling the judge that, \xe2\x80\x9cas far as [he was] concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d there were no mitigating circumstances of which she should be aware.  <em>Id.</em>, at D\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals erred in rejecting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the poor quality of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mitigating evidence prevented him from making \xe2\x80\x9ca colorable claim\xe2\x80\x9d of prejudice.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C\xe2\x80\x9346.  As summarized by the Court of Appeals, Landrigan wanted to introduce as mitigation evidence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[that] he was exposed to alcohol and drugs <em>in utero,</em> which may have resulted in cognitive and behavioral deficiencies consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome.  He was abandoned by his birth mother and suffered abandonment and attachment issues, as well as other behavioral problems throughout his childhood.</p>\n<p>\n\nHis adoptive mother was also an alcoholic, and Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s own alcohol and substance abuse began at an early age.  Based on his biological family\xe2\x80\x99s history of violence, Landrigan claims he may also have been genetically predisposed to violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 649.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained above, all but the last sentence refer to information that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother and ex-wife could have offered if Landrigan had allowed them to testify.  Indeed, the state postconviction court had much of this evidence before it by way of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s proffer.  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x9321.  The District Court could reasonably conclude that any additional evidence would have made no difference in the sentencing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Landrigan could not establish prejudice based on his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present the evidence he now wishes to offer.  Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation evidence was weak, and the postconviction court was well acquainted with Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s exceedingly violent past and had seen first hand his belligerent behavior.  Again, it is difficult to improve upon the initial Court of Appeals panel\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe prospect was chilling; before he was 30 years of age, Landrigan had murdered one man, repeatedly stabbed another one, escaped from prison, and within two months murdered still another man.  As the Arizona Supreme Court so aptly put it when dealing with one of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s other claims, \xe2\x80\x98[i]n his comments [to the sentencing judge], defendant not only failed to show remorse or offer mitigating evidence, but he flaunted his menacing behavior.\xe2\x80\x99  On this record, assuring the court that genetics made him the way he is could not have been very helpful.  There was no prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  272 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1229 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District Court abused its discretion in declining to grant Landrigan an evidentiary hearing.  Even assuming the truth of all the facts Landrigan sought to prove at the evidentiary hearing, he still could not be granted federal habeas relief because the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual determination that Landrigan would not have allowed counsel to present any mitigating evidence at sentencing is not an unreasonable determination of the facts under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and the mitigating evidence he seeks to introduce would not have changed the result.  In such circumstances, a District Court has discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although not at issue here, AEDPA generally prohibits federal habeas courts from granting evidentiary hearings when applicants have failed to develop the factual bases for their claims in state courts.  28 U.

Only years later did respondent learn that he suffers from a serious psychological condition that sheds important light on his earlier actions.  The reason why this and other mitigating evidence was unavailable is that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel failed to conduct a constitutionally adequate investigation.  See <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a> (2003).  In spite of this, the Court holds that respondent is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to explore the prejudicial impact of his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate representation.  It reasons that respondent \xe2\x80\x9cwould have\xe2\x80\x9d waived his right to introduce any mitigating evidence that counsel might have uncovered, <em>ante</em>, at 10, 13, and that such evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould have\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>made no difference in the sentencing anyway, <em>ante</em>, at 14.

Indeed, both the majority and dissenting judges on the en banc Court of Appeals agreed that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s limited investigation of Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s background fell below the standards of professional representation prevailing\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of his sentencing hearing.  441 F.\xc2\xa03d 638, 650 (CA9 2006) (Bea, J., dissenting); see <em>id</em>., at 643\xe2\x80\x93645 (\xe2\x80\x9cOn the record before us, it appears that Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did little to prepare for the sentencing aspect of the case. \xe2\x80\xa6 A comparison of the results of the minimal investigation by [counsel] with the amount of available mitigating evidence Landrigan claims was available leaves us with grave doubts whether Landrigan received effective assistance of counsel during his penalty phase proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).  The list of evidence that counsel failed to investigate is long.  For instance, counsel did not complete a psychological evaluation of respondent, which we now know would have uncovered a serious organic brain disorder.  He failed to consult an expert to explore the effects of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother\xe2\x80\x99s drinking and drug use during pregnancy.  And he never developed a history of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s troubled childhood with his adoptive family\xe2\x80\x94a childhood marked by physical and emotional abuse, neglect by his adoptive parents, his own serious substance abuse problems (including an overdose in his eighth or ninth grade classroom), a stunted education, and recurrent placement in substance abuse rehabilitation facilities, a psychiatric ward, and police custody.  See Declaration by Shannon Sumpter, App. 180\xe2\x80\x93192.  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to develop this background evidence was so glaring that even the sentencing judge noted that she had \xe2\x80\x9creceived very little information concerning the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s difficult family history.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert.

The bulk of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion argues that the District Court reasonably found that respondent waived his right to present any and all mitigating evidence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  As I shall explain, this argument finds no support in the Constitution or the record of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well established that a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of a constitutional right must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.  As far back as <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Zerbst</em>, we held that courts must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\xe2\x80\x99 of fundamental constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  304 U. S., at 464.  Since then, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have been unyielding in our insistence that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of his trial rights cannot be given effect unless it is \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98intelligent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Illinois </em>v.<em> Rodriguez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/177/index.html">497 U.

That case considered whether <em>Zerbst</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement<em> </em>applied to a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s consent to a search or seizure.  In determining that it did not, our decision<em> </em>turned on the \xe2\x80\x9cvast difference between those rights that protect a fair criminal trial and the rights guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  412 U. S., at 241.  We explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe<em> </em>requirement of a \xe2\x80\x98knowing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98intelligent\xe2\x80\x99 waiver was articulated in a case involving the validity of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision to forgo a right constitutionally guaranteed to protect a fair trial and the reliability of the truth-determining process\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Almost without exception, the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver has been applied only to those rights which the Constitution guarantees to a criminal defendant in order to preserve a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 236\xe2\x80\x93237.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe then ran through the extensive list of trial rights to which the knowing-and-intelligent-waiver requirement had already been applied.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We further noted that the <em>Zerbst</em> requirement had been applied to the \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver of trial rights in trial-type situations,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and to guilty pleas, which we said must be \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully scrutinized to determine whether the accused knew and understood all the rights to which he would be entitled at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  412 U. S., at 238.  If our emphasis on trial rights was not already clear, we went on to state:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA strict standard of waiver has been applied to those rights guaranteed to a criminal defendant to insure that he will be accorded the greatest possible opportunity to utilize every facet of the constitutional model of a fair criminal trial.  Any trial conducted in derogation of that model leaves open the possibility that the trial reached an unfair result precisely because all the protections specified in the Constitution were not provided\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The Constitution requires that every effort be made to see to it that a defendant in a criminal case has not unknowingly relinquished the basic protections that the Framers thought indispensable to a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 241\xe2\x80\x93242.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this unmistakable focus on trial rights, it makes little difference that we have not specifically \xe2\x80\x9cimposed an \xe2\x80\x98informed and knowing\xe2\x80\x99 requirement upon a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to introduce evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  A capital defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to present mitigating evidence is firmly established[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and can only be exercised at a sentencing <em>trial</em>.  For a capital defendant, the right to have the sentencing authority give full consideration to mitigating evidence that might support a sentence other than death is of paramount importance\xe2\x80\x94in some cases just as important as the right to representation by counsel protected in <em>Zerbst</em> or any of the trial rights discussed in <em>Schneckloth</em>.  Our longstanding precedent\xe2\x80\x94from <em>Zerbst</em> to <em>Schneckloth</em> to the only waiver case that the majority cites, <em>Iowa</em> v. <em>Tovar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/77/index.html">541 U. S. 77</a> (2004)[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]\xe2\x80\x94requires that any waiver of the right to adduce such evidence be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.  As such, the state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that respondent completely waived his right to present mitigating evidence involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s statements at the sentencing hearing do not qualify as an informed waiver under our precedents.  To understand why, it is important to remember the context in which the waiver issue arose.  In all of his postconviction proceedings, respondent has never brought a freestanding claim that he failed to knowingly or intelligently waive his right to present mitigating evidence.  See <em>Keeney</em> v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html">504 U. S. 1</a> (1992) (considering a claim that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent).  That is because respondent believes he never waived his right to present all available mitigating evidence.  See Brief for Respondent 20 (\xe2\x80\x9cLandrigan has alleged that \xe2\x80\xa6 he intended at most to forgo his right to put on his ex-wife and birth mother as witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d); Part III, <em>infra.</em>  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s only claim is that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this posture, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that respondent cannot make a knowing-and-intelligent-waiver argument because he failed to present it in the Arizona courts is nothing short of baffling.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Respondent never intended for waiver to become an issue because he never thought it was an issue.  Waiver only became a concern when he was forced to answer: (1) the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he could not establish prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> because he waived the right to present all mitigating evidence; and (2) the state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ince the defendant instructed his attorney not to bring any mitigation to the attention of the court, he cannot now claim counsel was ineffective because he did not \xe2\x80\x98explore additional grounds for arguing mitigation evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. F\xe2\x80\x934.  It is instructive that both the State and the postconviction court considered the waiver issue within the context of the prejudice prong of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  Even now, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s only \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) is that his counsel was ineffective for not adequately investigating and presenting mitigating evidence.  An <em>argument</em>\xe2\x80\x94particularly one made in the alternative and in response to another party\xe2\x80\x94is fundamentally different from a <em>claim</em>.  Cf. <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 534 (1992).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning back to that claim, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s purported waiver can only be appreciated in light of his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance.  To take just one example, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel asked a psychologist, Dr. Mickey McMahon, to conduct an initial interview with respondent.  But Dr. McMahon has submitted an affidavit stating that his experience was \xe2\x80\x9cquite different from the working relationship [he] had with counsel on other death penalty cases in which the psychological study went through a series of steps.\xe2\x80\x9d  Declaration by Mickey McMahon, App. 247.  In this case, Dr. McMahon was \xe2\x80\x9cnot authorized to conduct the next step in psychological testing that would have told [him] if \xe2\x80\xa6 there were any cognitive or neuropsychological deficits not observed during just an interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 246.  Even though Dr. McMahon told respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch more work was needed to provide an appropriate psychological study for a death penalty case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> counsel refused to let him investigate any further.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A more thorough investigation would have revealed that respondent suffers from an organic brain disorder.  See <em>Abdul-Kabir</em>, 550 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cpossible neurological damage\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant mitigating evidence).  Years after Dr. McMahon\xe2\x80\x99s aborted examination, another psychologist, Dr. Thomas C. Thompson, conducted a complete analysis of respondent.  Based on extensive interviews with respondent and several of his family members, a review of his family history, and multiple clinical tests, Dr. Thompson diagnosed respondent with Antisocial Personality Disorder.  See Declaration by Thomas C. Thompson, App. 149.  Dr. Thompson filed an affidavit in the District Court describing his diagnosis:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] actions did not constitute a lifestyle choice in the sense of an individual operating with a large degree of freedom, as we have come to define free will.  The inherited, prenatal, and early developmental factors severely impaired Mr. Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s ability to function in a society that expects individuals to operate in an organized and adaptive manner, taking into account the actions and consequences of their behaviors and their impact on society and its individual members.  Based on evaluation and investigation along with other relevant data, this type of responsible functioning is simply beyond Mr. Landrigan and, as far back as one can go, there is no indication that he ever had these capacities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 160.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the day of the sentencing hearing, the only mitigating evidence that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had investigated was the testimony of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother and ex-wife.  None of this neuropsychological information was available to respondent at the time of his purported waiver.  Yet the Court conspicuously avoids any mention of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s organic brain disorder.  It instead provides an incomplete list of other mitigating evidence that respondent would have presented and incorrectly assumes that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother and ex-wife would have covered it all.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9, 13.  Unless I missed the portion of the record indicating that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife and birth mother were trained psychologists, neither could have offered expert testimony about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s organic brain disorder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is of course true that respondent was aware of many of the individual pieces of mitigating evidence that contributed to Dr. Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent diagnosis.  He knew that his birth mother abandoned him at the age of six months, see App. 147; that his biological family had an extensive criminal history, see <em>id.,</em> at 146\xe2\x80\x93147; that his adoptive mother had \xe2\x80\x9caffective disturbances and chronic alcoholism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 148; that she routinely drank vodka until she passed out, see <em>id.,</em> at 184; that she would frequently strike him, once even \xe2\x80\x9chit[ting him] with a frying pan hard enough to leave a dent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 183, 185; that his childhood was difficult and he exhibited abandonment and attachment problems at an early age, see <em>id.,</em> at 148; that he had a bad temper and often threw violent tantrums as a child, see <em>id.,</em> at 182; and that he \xe2\x80\x9cbegan getting into trouble and using alcohol and drugs at an early age and, by adolescence, he had begun a series of placements in juvenile detention facilities, a psychiatric ward, and twice in drug abuse rehabilitation programs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 148.  Perhaps respondent also knew that his biological mother abused alcohol and amphetamines during her pregnancy, and that <em>in utero </em>exposure to drugs and alcohol has deleterious effects on the child.  See <em>id.,</em> at 155\xe2\x80\x93156.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if respondent knew all these things, we cannot assume that he could understand their consequences the way an expert psychologist could.  Without years of advanced education and a battery of complicated testing, respondent could not know that these experiences resulted in a serious organic brain disorder or what effect such a disorder might have on his behavior.  And precisely because his counsel failed to conduct a proper investigation, he did not know that this important evidence was available to him when he purportedly waived the right to present mitigating evidence.  It is hard to see how respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim of <em>Strickland</em> prejudice can be prejudiced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Strickland</em> error.  See <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a>, 58\xe2\x80\x9359 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without ever acknowledging that respondent lacked this information, the Court clings to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s discussion with respondent about \xe2\x80\x9cthe importance of mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The majority also places great weight on the fact that counsel explained to respondent that, as counsel, he had a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to disclose \xe2\x80\x98any and all mitigating factors \xe2\x80\xa6 to th[e] [c]ourt for consideration regarding the sentencing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Leaving aside the fact that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance did not demonstrate an understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cimportance of mitigating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94let alone knowledge of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any and all\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d such evidence\xe2\x80\x94counsel\xe2\x80\x99s abstract explanation cannot satisfy the demands of <em>Zerbst</em> and <em>Schneckloth</em>.  Unless respondent knew of the most significant mitigation evidence available to him, he could not have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights.  See <em>Battenfield </em>v.<em> Gibson</em>, 236 F.\xc2\xa03d 1215, 1229\xe2\x80\x931233 (CA10 2001) (holding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver invalid where there was \xe2\x80\x9cno indication [counsel] explained  \xe2\x80\xa6 what specific mitigation evidence was available\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Mitchell</em>, 268 F.\xc2\xa03d 417, 447\xe2\x80\x93448 (CA6 2001); see generally <em>Tovar</em>, 541 U.

The second witness is my client\xe2\x80\x99s natural mother, Virginia Gipson.  I believe both of those people had some important evidence that I believed the Court should take into mitigation concerning my client.  <em>However, Mr. Landrigan has made it clear to me </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 <em>that he does not wish anyone from his family to testify on his behalf today.</em></p><em>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have talked with Sandra Landrigan, his ex-wife.

And I have also talked with Ms. Gipson, and her evidence I think is very important and should have been brought to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  Both of them, after talking with Jeff today, have agreed with their, in one case son and the other ex-husband, they will not testify in his behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Why not?</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. FARRELL: Basically it\xe2\x80\x99s at my client\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, Your Honor.  I told him that in order to effectively represent him, especially concerning the fact that the State is seeking the death penalty, any and all mitigating factors, I was under a duty to disclose those factors to this Court for consideration regarding the sentencing.  He is adamant he does not want any testimony from his family, specifically these two people that I have here, his mother, under subpoena, and as well as having flown in his ex-wife.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  App. to Pet. for Cert. D\xe2\x80\x932 to D\xe2\x80\x933 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s answers to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s questions must be read in light of this discussion.  When the judge immediately turned from counsel to respondent and asked about \xe2\x80\x9cany mitigating circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d the entire proceeding to that point had been about the possible testimony of his birth mother or ex-wife.  Counsel had only informed the court that respondent did not want any testimony \xe2\x80\x9cfrom his family.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at D\xe2\x80\x933.  Neither counsel nor respondent said anything about other mitigating evidence.  A fair reading of the full sentencing transcript makes clear that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s answers referred only to the testimony of his ex-wife and birth mother.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s answers were necessarily infected by his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate.  Respondent does not dispute that he instructed his counsel not to present his family\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  Brief for Respondent 47 (\xe2\x80\x9cLandrigan contends that his intent was not to effect a broad waiver but, instead, merely to waive presentation of testimony from his mother and his ex-wife\xe2\x80\x9d).  But his limited waiver cannot change the fact that he was unaware that the words \xe2\x80\x9cany mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d could include his organic brain disorder, the medical consequences of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s drinking and drug use during pregnancy, and his abusive upbringing with his adoptive<em> </em>family.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mind, the words \xe2\x80\x9cany mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d just meant the incomplete evidence that counsel offered to present.  As the en banc Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ad his lawyer conducted an investigation and uncovered other types of mitigating evidence, Landrigan might well have been able to direct the court to other mitigating circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 646.  It is therefore error to read respondent\xe2\x80\x99s simple \xe2\x80\x9cYeah\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNot as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned\xe2\x80\x9d as waiving anything other than the little he knew was available to him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that petitioner waived his right to present any mitigating evidence was an unreasonable determination of the facts under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  While the Court is correct that the postconviction judge was the same judge who sentenced respondent, we must remember that her postconviction opinion was written in 1995\xe2\x80\x94<em>five years</em> after the sentencing proceeding.  Although the judge\xe2\x80\x99s memory deserves some deference, her opinion reflects many of the same flaws as does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Instead of reexamining the entire trial transcript, she only quoted the same two-question exchange with respondent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. F\xe2\x80\x934.  And unlike this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated reference to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s behavior at sentencing, she did not mention it at all.  Her analysis consists of an incomplete review of the transcript and an unsupported summary conclusion that respondent told his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I believe that neither the Constitution nor the record supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s waiver holding, respondent is at least entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this question as well as his broader claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Respondent insists that he never instructed his counsel not to investigate other mitigating evidence.  Even the State concedes that there has been no finding on this issue.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Respondent 37 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[Judge Kozinski]: There\xe2\x80\x99s no [state court] finding at all even by inference as to investigation?  There\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 no finding that \xe2\x80\xa6 the trial court made that goes to Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s attitude about allowing his lawyer to investigate?\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 [Counsel for State]: I would agree\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Ninth Circuit Oral Argument Audio 43:55\xe2\x80\x9344:30)).  He has long maintained that he would have permitted the presentation of mitigating evidence if only counsel was prepared to introduce evidence other than testimony from his birth mother and ex-wife.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. E\xe2\x80\x932.  Respondent planned to call his counsel at an evidentiary hearing to testify about these very assertions.  See App. 126.  Because counsel is in the best position to clarify whether respondent gave any blanket instructions not to investigate or present mitigating evidence, the Court is wrong to decide this case before any evidence regarding respondent\xe2\x80\x99s instructions can be developed.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Almost as an afterthought, the Court holds in the alternative that \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Landrigan could not establish prejudice based on his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present the evidence he now wishes to offer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  It of course does this on a cold and incomplete factual record.  Describing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation case as \xe2\x80\x9cweak,\xe2\x80\x9d and emphasizing his \xe2\x80\x9cexceedingly violent past\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbelligerent behavior\xe2\x80\x9d at sentencing, the Court concludes that there is no way that respondent can establish prejudice with the evidence he seeks to introduce.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning is flawed in several respects.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, as has been discussed above but bears repeating, the Court thoroughly misrepresents respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence.  It is all too easy to view respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigation case as \xe2\x80\x9cweak\xe2\x80\x9d when you assume away his most powerful evidence.  The Court ignores respondent\xe2\x80\x99s organic brain disorder, which would have explained not only his criminal history but also the repeated outbursts at sentencing.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It mistakenly assumes that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother and ex-wife could have testified about the medical consequences of fetal alcohol syndrome.  And it inaccurately states that these women could have described his turbulent childhood with his adoptive family.  We have repeatedly said that evidence of this kind can influence a sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to whether death is the proper punishment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 535 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]vidence about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background [or to emotional and mental problems] may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 115 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here can be no doubt that evidence of a turbulent family history, of beatings by a harsh father, and of severe emotional disturbance is particularly relevant\xe2\x80\x9d).  The evidence here might well have convinced a sentencer that a death sentence was not appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the aggravating circumstances relied on by the sentencing judge are not as strong as the Court makes them out to be.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  To be sure, respondent had already committed two violent offenses.  But so had Terry Williams, and this Court still concluded that he suffered prejudice when his attorney failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 368 (2000) (noting that Williams confessed to \xe2\x80\x9ctwo separate violent assaults on elderly victims,\xe2\x80\x9d including one that left an elderly woman in a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vegetative state\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 398 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he graphic description of Williams\xe2\x80\x99 childhood, filled with abuse and privation, or the reality that he was \xe2\x80\x98borderline mentally retarded,\xe2\x80\x99 might well have influenced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of his moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The only other aggravating factor was that Landrigan committed his crime for pecuniary gain[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]\xe2\x80\x94but there are serious doubts about that.  As the en banc Court of Appeals explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was limited evidence regarding the pecuniary gain aggravator.  The judge noted that the victim\xe2\x80\x99s apartment had been ransacked as if the perpetrator were looking for something, and that this demonstrated an expectation of pecuniary gain, <em>even though Landrigan did not actually steal anything of value</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 649 (emphasis added).  Thus, while we should not ignore respondent\xe2\x80\x99s violent past, it is certainly possible\xe2\x80\x94even likely\xe2\x80\x94that evidence of his neurological disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, and abusive upbringing would have influenced the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of his moral blameworthiness and altered the outcome of his sentencing.  As such, respondent has plainly alleged facts that, if substantiated at an evidentiary hearing, would entitle him to relief.  See <em>Townsend</em>, 372 U. S., at 312.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision can only be explained by its increasingly familiar effort to guard the floodgates of litigation.  Immediately before turning to the facts of this case, it states that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f district courts were required to allow federal habeas applicants to develop even the most insubstantial factual allegations in evidentiary hearings, district courts would be forced to reopen factual disputes that were conclusively resolved in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  However, habeas cases requiring evidentiary hearings have been \xe2\x80\x9cfew in number,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no clear evidence that this particular classification of habeas proceedings has burdened the dockets of the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Keeney</em>, 504 U. S., at 24 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Even prior to the passage of the Antiterriorism and Effective Death Act of 1996, district courts held evidentiary hearings in only <em>1.17%</em> of all federal habeas cases.  See Report to the Federal Courts Study Committee of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and their Relation to the States (Mar. 12, 1990) (Richard A. Posner, Chair), in 1 Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports 468\xe2\x80\x93515 (July 1, 1990).  This figure makes it abundantly clear that doing justice does not always cause the heavens to fall.  The Court would therefore do well to heed Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s just reminder that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e ought not take steps which diminish the likelihood that [federal] courts will base their legal decision on an accurate assessment of the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Keeney</em>, 504 U. S., at 24 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may well be true that respondent would have completely waived his right to present mitigating evidence if that evidence had been adequately investigated at the time of sentencing.  It may also be true that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence could not outweigh his violent past. What is certainly true, however, is that an evidentiary hearing would provide answers to these questions.  I emphatically agree with the majority of judges on the en banc Court of Appeals that it was an abuse of discretion to refuse to conduct such a hearing in this capital case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even more troubling is that prior to sentencing, counsel had clues for where to find this important mitigating evidence.  As the Court of Appeals noted, respondent has alleged that his birth mother sent a letter to counsel explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c(1) Landrigan began drinking at an early age because his adoptive mother was an alcoholic and would walk around nude in front of him, (2) Landrigan\xe2\x80\x99s father was on death row in Arkansas and the \xe2\x80\x98blood link to Darrel [and] I are what has messed up his whole life,\xe2\x80\x99 and (3) \xe2\x80\x98Jeff needs help mentally like his father did.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  441 F.\xc2\xa03d 638, 644 (CA9 2006) (en banc).
