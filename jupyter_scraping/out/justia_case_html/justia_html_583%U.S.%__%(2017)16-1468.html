In this case, a California court permitted the State to amend a criminal complaint to which the respondent, Michael Cuero, had pleaded guilty.  That guilty plea would have led to a maximum sentence of 14 years and 4 months.  The court acknowledged that permitting the amendment would lead to a higher sentence, and it consequently permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea.  Cuero then pleaded guilty to the amended complaint and was sentenced to a term with a minimum of 25 years.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that the California court had made a mistake of federal law.  In its view, the law entitled Cuero to specific performance of the lower 14-year, 4-month sentence that he would have received had the complaint not been amended.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question here is whether the state-court decision \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Did our prior decisions (1) clearly <i>require</i> the state court to impose the lower sentence that the parties originally expected; or (2) instead permit the State\xe2\x80\x99s sentence-raising amendment where the defendant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea?  Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that a state court must choose the first alternative, we reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On October 27, 2005, the State of California charged Michael Cuero with two felonies and a misdemeanor.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a\xe2\x80\x9333a.  Its complaint alleged that on October 14, 2005, Cuero drove his car into, and seriously injured, Jeffrey Feldman, who was standing outside of his parked pickup truck.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27a\xe2\x80\x9328a.  The complaint further alleged that Cuero was then on parole, that he was driving without a license, that he was driving under the influence of methamphetamine, and that he had in his possession a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuero initially pleaded \xe2\x80\x9cnot guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  But on December 8, he changed his plea.  A form entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPLEA OF GUILTY/NO CONTEST\xe2\x80\x94FELONY\xe2\x80\x9d signed by Cuero, the prosecutor, and the trial court memorialized the terms of Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.  See <i>id.</i>, at 77a\xe2\x80\x9385a.  On that form, Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felony counts.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \xc2\xa723153(a) (West 2017) (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa712021(a)(1) (West 2005) (unlawful possession of a firearm).  He also admitted that he had previously served four separate prison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which qualifies as a predicate offense under California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthree strikes\xe2\x80\x9d law.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7667(a)(1) (West 2017); see <i>Ewing</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 11\n\xe2\x80\x9317 (2003).  Finally, Cuero acknowledged on this guilty-plea form that he understood that he \xe2\x80\x9cmay receive this maximum punishment as a result of my plea: 14 years, 4 months in State Prison, $10,000 fine and 4 years parole.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Following a hearing, the state trial court accepted the plea and granted California\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the remaining misdemeanor charge.  The court then scheduled the sentencing hearing for January 11, 2006.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before the hearing took place, however, the prosecution determined that another of Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s four prior convictions qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cstrike\xe2\x80\x9d and that the signed guilty-plea form had erroneously listed only one strike.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon).  This second strike meant that Cuero faced not a maximum punishment of just over 14 years (172 months), but a <i>minimum </i>punishment of 25 years.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7667(e)(2)(A)(ii), 1170.12(c)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly.  It pointed to Cal. Penal Code \xc2\xa7969.5(a), which provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever it shall be discovered that a pending complaint to which a plea of guilty has been made under Section 859a does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this state or elsewhere, the complaint may be forthwith amended to charge the prior conviction or convictions and the amendments may and shall be made upon order of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuero argued that the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion was untimely and prejudicial.  But the trial court granted the motion.  At the same time, the court permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change.  It concluded that \xc2\xa7969.5(a) \xe2\x80\x9cguide[d]\xe2\x80\x9d its inquiry and was best read to reflect a legislative determination that criminal complaints should charge all prior felony convictions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a.  The court added that the case was distinguishable from \xe2\x80\x9ca situation where the [State] might, after a guilty plea, seek to amend\xe2\x80\x9d a criminal complaint by adding \xe2\x80\x9cnew charges\xe2\x80\x9d or facts that fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.  <i>Id.,</i> at 179a.  But here, where only \xe2\x80\x9calleged prior convictions\xe2\x80\x9d were at issue, the court could eliminate any prejudice to Cuero by allowing him to withdraw his initial guilty plea, thereby restoring both parties to the status quo prior to its entry.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Soon thereafter, California amended the complaint.  The complaint as amended charged Cuero with one felony, (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug under Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \xc2\xa723153(a)), and it alleged two prior strikes.  Cuero then withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint.  On April 20, 2006, the trial court sentenced Cuero to the stipulated term of 25 years to life.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied a state habeas petition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cuero then filed a petition for federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The Federal District Court denied Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  <i>Cuero</i> v. <i>Cate</i>, 827 F.\xc2\xa03d 879 (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit panel hearing the appeal held that the state trial court had \xe2\x80\x9cacted contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9crefusing to enforce the original plea agreement\xe2\x80\x9d with its 172-month maximum sentence.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 888.  It wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n this context, specific performance\xe2\x80\x9d of that plea agreement\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> sentencing Cuero to no more than the roughly 14-year sentence reflected in the 2005 guilty-plea form\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 890, n.\xc2\xa014.  The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of seven judges.  <i>Cuero</i> v. <i>Cate</i>, 850 F.\xc2\xa03d 1019 (2017).  The State then filed a petition for certiorari here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit has already issued its mandate in this case.  And the state trial court, in light of that mandate, has resentenced Cuero.  Cuero argues that this fact renders this controversy moot.  The State and Cuero, however, continue to disagree about the proper length of Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, a portion of which he has not yet served.  Thus, neither the losing party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to obtain a stay preventing the mandate of the Court of Appeals from issuing nor the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action in light of that mandate makes the case moot.  <i>Mancusi</i> v. <i>Stubbs</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204\n\xe2\x80\x93207, and\xc2\xa0n. 1 (1972); <i>Eagles</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Samuels</i>,\n\n329 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304\n\xe2\x80\x93308 (1946).  Reversal would simply \xe2\x80\x9cund[o] what the <i>habeas corpus </i>court did,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, permit the state courts to determine in the first instance the lawfulness of a longer sentence not yet served.  <i>Id</i>., at 308.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit, in ordering specific performance of the 172-month sentence set forth on Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s original guilty-plea form, reasoned as follows.  First, the court concluded that Cuero\xe2\x80\x99s guilty-plea form amounts to an enforceable plea agreement.  827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 884\xe2\x80\x93885.  Second, that plea agreement amounts to, and should be interpreted as, a contract under state contract law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 883<i> </i>(citing <i>Ricketts</i> v. <i>Adamson</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n5, n.\n3 (1987)\n).  Third, California contract law would consider the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to amend the complaint as a breach of contract.  827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 887\xe2\x80\x93890.  Fourth, \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedy for breach must \xe2\x80\x98repair the harm caused by the breach.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 890 (quoting <i>People</i> v. <i>Toscano</i>, 124 Cal. App.\xc2\xa04th 340, 20 Cal. Rptr.\xc2\xa03d 923, 927 (2004)).  Fifth, rescission failed to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98repair the harm.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 891.  Sixth, consequently Cuero was entitled to specific performance, namely, a maximum prison term of 172 months (14 years and 4 months).  <i>Ibid.</i>  And, seventh, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision was itself \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreason-able application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1); see 827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 888.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We shall assume purely for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake that the State violated the Constitution when it moved to amend the complaint.  But we still are unable to find in Supreme Court precedent that \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established federal law\xe2\x80\x9d demanding specific performance as a remedy.  To the contrary, no \xe2\x80\x9choldin[g] of this Court\xe2\x80\x9d requires the remedy of specific performance under the circumstances present here.  <i>Harrington</i> v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86,\n100 (2011)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two of our prior decisions address these issues.  The first, <i>Santobello </i>v.<i> New York</i>,\n\n404 U.\xc2\xa0S. 257 (1971)\n, held that a defendant may not be bound to a plea agreement following a prosecutorial breach of an enforceable provision of such an agreement.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 262.  As relevant here, however, Chief Justice Burger wrote in the opinion for the Court that the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate relief to which petitioner is entitled\xe2\x80\x9d must be left \xe2\x80\x9cto the discretion of the state court, which is in a better position to decide whether the circumstances of this case require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea\xe2\x80\x9d or, alterna-tively, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances require granting the relief sought by petitioner, <i>i.e.,</i> the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Ninth Circuit cited a concurrence in <i>Santobello </i>by Justice Douglas, which added that \xe2\x80\x9ca court ought to accord a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s [remedial] preference considerable, if not controlling, weight inasmuch as the fundamental rights flouted by a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s breach of a plea bargain are those of the defendant, not of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 891, n.\xc2\xa014 (quoting <i>Santobello</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 267).  Three other Justices agreed with Justice Douglas on this point, and because only seven Justices participated in the case, the Ninth Circuit suggested that a four-Justice majority in <i>Santo-bello</i> seemed to favor looking to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s preferred remedy.  827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 891, n.\xc2\xa014 (citing <i>Santobello</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 268, and n. (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Ninth Circuit also pointed in support to its own Circuit precedent, a criminal procedure treatise, a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, and a law review article.  See 827 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890\xe2\x80\x93891, n.\xc2\xa014 (citing <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Terhune</i>, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 688, 699, n.\xc2\xa011 (CA9 2006); 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa721.2(e) (4th ed. 2015); <i>State </i>v.<i> Tourtellotte</i>, 88 Wash.\xc2\xa02d 579, 564 P.\xc2\xa02d 799, 802 (1977); and Fischer, Beyond Santobello\xe2\x80\x94Remedies for Reneged Plea Bargains, 2 U. San Fernando Valley L. Rev. 121, 125 (1973)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There are several problems with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning below.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fairminded jurists could dis-agree\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <i>Santobello</i>.  <i>Richter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 101 (quoting <i>Yarborough </i>v.<i> Alvarado,</i>\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 652,\n664 (2004)\n).  Moreover, in <i>Mabry </i>v.<i> Johnson</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 504 (1984)\n,<i> </i>the Court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Santobello</i> expressly declined to hold that the Constitution compels specific performance of a broken prosecutorial promise as the remedy for such a plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 510\xe2\x80\x93511, n.\xc2\xa011 (citing <i>Santobello</i>, 404 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93263; <i>id.</i>, at 268\xe2\x80\x93269 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Court added that \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting Santobello to replead was within the range of constitutionally appropriate remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 510, n.\xc2\xa011.  Where, as here, none of our prior decisions clearly entitles Cuero to the relief he seeks, the \xe2\x80\x9cstate court\xe2\x80\x99s decision could not be \xe2\x80\x98contrary to\xe2\x80\x99 any holding from this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Woods </i>v. <i>Donald</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 6) (quoting <i>Lopez</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 5)).  Finally, as we have repeatedly pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9ccircuit precedent does not constitute \xe2\x80\x98clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Glebe</i> v. <i>Frost</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 3) (quoting\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)).  Nor, of course, do state-court decisions, treatises, or law review articles.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all these reasons, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred when it held that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal law\xe2\x80\x9d as interpreted by this Court \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d establishes that specific performance is constitutionally required here.  We decide no other issue in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed <i>in forma pauperis </i>are granted.  We reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
