JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 1968, the appellant, Mrs. Dorothy Lynch, a resident of New Haven, Connecticut, directed her employer to deposit $10 of her $69 weekly wage in a credit union savings account.  In 1969, appellee Household Finance Corp. sued Mrs. Lynch for $525 in a state court, alleging nonpayment of a promissory note.  Before she was served with process, the appellee corporation garnished her savings account under the provisions of Connecticut law that authorize summary pre-judicial garnishment at the behest of attorneys for alleged creditors. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The appellant then brought this class action in a federal district court against Connecticut sheriffs who levy on bank accounts and against creditors who invoke </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 405 U. S. 540</a></p><p> the garnishment statute. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Mrs. Lynch alleged that she had no prior notice of the garnishment and no opportunity to be heard.  She claimed that the state statutes were invalid under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  A district court of three judges was convened to hear the claim under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2281 and 2284. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 405 U. S. 541</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court did not reach the merits of the case.  It dismissed the complaint without an evidentiary hearing on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343(3), and that relief was bared by the statute prohibiting injunctions against state court proceedings, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283. 318 F.Supp. 1111.  We noted probable jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] to consider the jurisdictional issues presented.  401 U.S. 935. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 405 U. S. 542</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We hold, for the reasons that follow, that neither \xc2\xa7 1343(3) nor \xc2\xa7 2283 warranted dismissal of the appellant\'s complaint.  Accordingly, we remand the case to the District Court for consideration of the remaining issues in this litigation.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In dismissing the appellant\'s complaint, the District Court held that \xc2\xa7 1343(3) applies only if "personal" rights, as opposed to "property" rights, are allegedly impaired.  The court relied on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Eisen v. Eastman,</em> 421 F.2d 560, 563, which rested, in turn, on Mr. Justice Stone\'s well known opinion a generation ago in <em>Hague v.

S. 545</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The broad concept of civil rights embodied in the 1866 Act and in the Fourteenth Amendment is unmistakably evident in the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the direct lineal ancestor of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1983 and 1343(3).  Not only was \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act derived from \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] but the 1871 Act was passed for the express purpose of "enforc[ing] the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment."  17 Stat. 13.  And the rights that Congress sought to protect in the Act of 1871 were described by the chairman of the House Select Committee that drafted the legislation as "the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety."  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 69, (1871) (Rep. Shellabarger, quoting from <em>Corfield v. Coryell,</em> 6 F.Cas. 546, 551-552 (No. 3230) (CCED Pa.)).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 405 U. S. 546</a></p><p> That the protection of property as well as personal rights was intended is also confirmed by President Grant\'s message to Congress urging passage of the legislation, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and by the remarks of many members of Congress during the legislative debates. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In 1875, Congress granted the federal courts jurisdiction of "all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity . . . arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States."  18 Stat. 470.  Unlike \xc2\xa7 1343(3), this general federal question provision, the forerunner of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331, required that a minimum amount in controversy be alleged and proved. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Mr. Justice Stone\'s opinion in <em>Hague, supra,</em> as well as the federal court decisions that followed it, <em>e.g., Eisen v. Eastman,</em> 421 F.2d 560, reflect the view that there is an apparent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 405 U. S. 547</a></p><p> conflict between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1343(3) and 1331, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] <em>i.e.,</em> that a broad reading of \xc2\xa7 1343(3) to include all rights secured by the Constitution would render \xc2\xa7 1331, and its amount in controversy requirement, superfluous.  These opinions sought to harmonize the two jurisdictional provisions by construing \xc2\xa7 1343(3) as conferring federal jurisdiction of suits brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 only when the right asserted is personal, not proprietary.</p>\n<p>The initial failure of this reasoning is that the supposed conflict between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1343(3) and 1331 simply does not exist.  Section 1343(3) applies only to alleged infringements of rights under "color of . . . State law," whereas \xc2\xa7 1331 contains no such requirement.  Thus, for example, in suits against federal officials for alleged deprivations of constitutional rights, it is necessary to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement for federal jurisdiction.  <em>See Oestereich v. Selective Service Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/233/case.html">393 U. S. 233</a></span>; <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span>.</p>\n<p>But the more fundamental point to be made is that any such contraction of \xc2\xa7 1343(3) jurisdiction is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 405 U. S. 548</a></p><p> supported by the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1331.  The 1875 Act giving the federal courts power to hear suits arising under Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution was, like the Act of 1871, an expansion of national authority over matters that, before the Civil War, had been left to the States.  F. Frankfurter &amp; J. Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court 65 (1928); <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html#245">389 U. S. 245</a></span>-248; Chadbourn &amp; Levin, Original Jurisdiction of Federal Questions, 90 U.Pa.L.Rev. 639, 645 (1942).  The Act, therefore, is "clearly . . . part of, rather than an exception to, the trend of legislation which preceded it."  Chadbourn &amp; Levin, <em>supra,</em> at 645; <em>Zwickler, supra.</em>  There was very little discussion of the measure before its enactment, in contrast to the extensive congressional debate that attended the passage of the Act of 1871. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  And there is, as a result, no indication whatsoever that Congress, in a rather hastily passed measure, intended to narrow the scope of a provision passed four years earlier as part of major civil rights legislation. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 405 U. S. 549</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The "cardinal rule . . . that repeals by implication are not favored," <em>Posadas v. National City Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/497/case.html">296 U.

The statutory descendants of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 must be given the meaning and sweep that their origins and their language dictate. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, although the purpose of the amount in controversy requirement is to reduce congestion in the federal courts, S.Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. (1958), Congress has substantially lessened its importance with respect to \xc2\xa7 1331 by passing many statutes that confer federal question jurisdiction without an amount in controversy requirement. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  So it was that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 405 U. S. 550</a></p><p> when Congress increased the jurisdictional amount from $3,000 to $10,000, Act of July 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 415, it made clear that its primary concern was to reduce the federal judiciary\'s workload with regard to cases arising under federal diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1332, not under \xc2\xa7 1331. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>A final, compelling reason for rejecting a "personal liberties" limitation upon \xc2\xa7 1343(3) is the virtual impossibility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 405 U. S. 551</a></p><p> of applying it. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The federal courts have been particularly bedeviled by "mixed" cases in which both personal and property right are implicated, and the line between them has been difficult to draw with any consistency or principled objectivity. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 405 U. S. 552</a></p><p> before us presents a good example of the conceptual difficulties created by the test. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Such difficulties indicate that the dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one.  Property does not have rights.  People have rights.  The right to enjoy property without unlawful deprivation, no less than the right to speak or the right to travel, is, in truth, a "personal" right, whether the "property" in question be a welfare check, a home, or a savings account.  In fact, a fundamental interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right in property.  Neither could have meaning without the other.  That rights in property are basic civil rights has long been recognized.  J. Locke, Of Civil Government 82-85 (1924); J.

Congress recognized these rights in 1871 when it enacted the predecessor of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1983 and 1343(3).  We do no more than reaffirm the judgment of Congress today.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, a federal court may not</p>\n<p>"grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."</p>\n<p>The District Court relied upon this statute as an alternative ground for the dismissal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 405 U. S. 553</a></p><p> of the appellant\'s complaint.  The appellant contends that \xc2\xa7 2283 is inapplicable to this case because prejudgment garnishment under Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-329 [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] is not a proceeding in state court.  We agree. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In Connecticut, garnishment is instituted without judicial order.  <em>Ibid.;</em> 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure 151 (2d ed.1970). [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The levy of garnishment -- usually effected by a deputy sheriff -- does not confer jurisdiction on state courts, and may, in fact, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 405 U. S. 554</a></p><p> occur prior to commencement of an alleged creditor\'s suit.  <em>Young v. Mariotta,</em> 136 Conn. 429, 433, 71 A.2d 924, 926.  Despite the state court\'s control over the plaintiff\'s docketed case, garnishment is "distinct from and independent of that action."  <em>Potter v. Appleby,</em> 136 Conn. 641, 643, 73 A. .2d 819, 820.  The garnished property is secured not under authority of the court, but merely in the hands of the garnishee.  Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-329.  Prejudgment garnishment is thus levied and maintained without the participation of the state courts.</p>\n<p>In this case, the appellant sought to enjoin garnishment proceedings, not the finance company\'s suit on the promissory note.  The District Court noted that "garnishment may be separated from the underlying <em>in personam</em> action," but held that \xc2\xa7 2283 was a bar because the interference with existing creditors\' suits caused by such an injunction "probably would be substantial."  318 F.Supp. at 1115.  According to the appellees, interference would occur because garnishment is necessary to make any eventual judgment in the pending state suit effective.  <em>Hill v. Martin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/393/case.html">296 U. S. 393</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/393/case.html#403">296 U. S. 403</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This argument is not persuasive in the context of the Connecticut prejudgment garnishment scheme.  Garnishment might serve to make a subsequent judgment effective.  <em>Cf. Hill, supra; Manufacturers Record Publishing Co. v. Lauer,</em> 268 F.2d 187, <em>cert. denied,</em> 361 U.S. 913; <em>Furnish v. Board of Medical Examiners of California,</em> 257 F.2d 520, <em>cert. denied,</em> 358 U.S. 882.  But the garnishment was, in this case, an action taken by private parties who were not proceeding under a court\'s supervision [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] and who were using, as agents, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 405 U. S. 555</a></p><p> state officials who were themselves not acting pursuant to a court order or under a court\'s authority.</p>\n<p>In <em>Hill, supra,</em> we said that the "proceeding" that a federal court is forbidden to enjoin "includes all steps taken or which may be taken <em>in the state court or by its officers</em> from the <em>institution</em> to the close of the final process."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/393/case.html#403">296 U. S. 403</a></span> (emphasis supplied).  In this case, the garnishment occurred before the appellee corporation had served the appellant with process.</p>\n<p>More important, the state court and its officers are insulated from control over the garnishment.  Connecticut appears to be one of the few States authorizing an attorney for an alleged creditor to garnish or attach property without any participation by a judge or clerk of the court.  Stephenson, <em>supra,</em> at 230.  A person whose account has been seized can get only minimal relief, at best. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The state courts have held that they cannot enjoin a garnishment on the ground that it was levied unconstitutionally.  <em>Michael\'s Jewelers v. Handy,</em> 6 Conn.Cir. 103, 266 A.2d 904; <em>Harris v. Barone,</em> 147 Conn. 233, 158 A.2d 855.  One assumption underlying \xc2\xa7 2283 is that state courts will vindicate constitutional claims as fairly and efficiently as federal courts.  But this assumption cannot obtain when the doors of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 405 U. S. 556</a></p><p> state courts are effectively closed to a person seeking to enjoin a garnishment on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p>Because of the extrajudicial nature of Connecticut garnishment, an injunction against its maintenance is not, therefore, barred by the terms of \xc2\xa7 2283.  In light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether \xc2\xa7 1983 is an exception to \xc2\xa7 2283 "expressly authorized by Act of Congress."  We have explicitly left that question open in other decisions. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  And we may put it to one side in this case, because the state act that the federal court was asked to enjoin was not a proceeding "in a State court" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2283.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant\'s suit for an injunction under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Accordingly, the judgment before us is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The garnishment was levied pursuant to Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-329.

Subsequently, Composano released the garnishment.  An issue of mootness -- which was not resolved by the District Court -- is thus presented.  We do not, however, reach this issue.  Appellant Lynch had a savings account garnished, appellant Toro a checking account.  The considerations applicable to one type of account seem identical to those applicable to the other.  In this opinion, therefore, we shall only refer to the case of appellant Lynch.</p>\n<p>An issue is also raised as to the propriety of the classes purported to be represented by the appellants and appellees.

Congress has treated judicial interference with the enforcement of state tax laws as a subject governed by unique considerations, and has restricted federal jurisdiction accordingly:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341.

In 1874, Congress consolidated the various federal statutes at large under separate titles in the Revised Statutes in order to codify existing law.  In the process, the substantive provision of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act became separated from its jurisdictional counterpart.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979.  Although the original substantive provision had protected rights privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution, the provision in the Revised Statutes was enlarged to provide protection for rights, privileges, or immunities secured by federal law as well.</p>\n<p>Originally, suits under \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act could be brought in either circuit or district court.  After codification in 1874, the jurisdictional grant to the district courts was identical in scope with the expanded substantive provision, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 563(12).  Circuit court jurisdiction was limited to claimed deprivations of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or by any Act of Congress "providing for equal rights."  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 629(16).  In 1911, when Congress abolished the circuit courts\' original jurisdiction and merged the two jurisdictional sections into what is now \xc2\xa7 1343(3), the "equal rights" limitation was retained in the revised jurisdictional grant.  Act of Mar. 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087.  Despite the different wording of the substantive and jurisdictional provisions, when the \xc2\xa7 1983 claim alleges constitutional violations, \xc2\xa7 1343(3) provides jurisdiction and both sections are construed identically.  <em>Douglas v.

Schmidt,</em> 317 F.Supp. 1027.  <em>See also</em> <a href="#F19" name="T19">n</a>19, <em>supra.</em>  Yet, without always explaining why such interests are "personal," rather than "proprietary," courts have consistently found civil rights jurisdiction over suits alleging discrimination in the issuance of business licenses.  <em>See, e.g., Barnes v. Merritt,</em> 376 F.2d 8; <em>Glicker v. Michigan Liquor Control Comm\'n,</em> 160 F.2d 96.  Similarly, claims involving discrimination in employment, <em>e.g., Birnbaum v.

New York City Housing Authority,</em> 425 F.2d 853, are often found cognizable under \xc2\xa7 1343(3).  How such "personal" interests are to be distinguished from the "property" interest in wages deposited in a savings account, as in this case, is not readily discernible.  <em>Compare</em> this case with <em>Santiago v.

But I cannot agree either with the approach that the majority takes to the anti-injunction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 405 U. S. 557</a></p><p> statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283, or its conclusion that the statute does not bar this suit.  I do not mean to suggest that appellants\' due process attack on the Connecticut garnishment statute is not substantial.  It obviously is.  <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/337/case.html">395 U. S. 337</a></span> (1969).  Nevertheless, in my view, appellants should be required to press their constitutional attack in the state courts.</p>\n<p>In Connecticut, garnishment or attachment is one method of beginning a lawsuit.  Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-329; 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure 156-157, 232-237 (2d ed.1970).  Of course, the requisite personal service upon a defendant is necessary to obtain <em>in personam</em> jurisdiction, Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-54, as well as to secure an effective garnishment, Stephenson, <em>supra,</em> at 244, but, as a matter of right, in certain kinds of civil actions, a plaintiff may simultaneously garnish a defendant\'s bank account and serve a summons upon the defendant, together with a complaint stating the nature of the underlying action.  Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-329.  A state court obtains jurisdiction of the action and of questions concerning the garnishment when return of process is made to that court.  Stephenson, <em>supra,</em> at 67.  Garnishment is "ancillary to the main action for damages, and cannot exist without such action."  <em>Id.</em> at 143.  Its purpose, as the majority notes, is to secure property that will thus be made available for the satisfaction of a judgment.  <em>Ibid.</em>  A writ of garnishment may be issued by a judge of the court of jurisdiction, Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 52-89 (Supp. 1969), but, because garnishment in Connecticut, unlike most other States, is a matter of right, and requires no prior judicial determination, the writ may also be issued by a court clerk or licensed attorney.  Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \xc2\xa7 51-85.  In either </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 405 U. S. 558</a></p><p> case, the matter is accomplished simply by completing a form.</p>\n<p>Appellant Lynch brought this federal action to enjoin the garnishment more than seven months after the writ had been executed, the summons and complaint served, process returned, and the case docketed in Connecticut court.  At the earliest moment that a federal injunction could have issued, the state court proceeding was well under way.  Despite this, the majority purports to sever the garnishment from the action that underlies it.  The Court reasons that Connecticut garnishment is not a proceeding in state court, because it is carried out by private parties not acting pursuant to a court order.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/538/case.html#554">405 U. S. 554</a></span>-555.</p>\n<p>If the majority means that garnishment is a severable matter, independent of the main suit, and for that reason outside of \xc2\xa7 2283, then I would suppose it permissible for a federal court to enjoin any garnishment or attachment, whether obtained at the inception of a lawsuit, while it is in progress, or after judgment and for the purpose of execution.  This approach to the anti-injunction statute, articulated in <em>Simon v. Southern R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/236/115/case.html">236 U. S. 115</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/236/115/case.html#124">236 U. S. 124</a></span>-125 (1915), was, I thought, laid to rest in <em>Hill v. Martin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/393/case.html">296 U. S. 393</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/393/case.html#403">296 U. S. 403</a></span> (1935), where the Court construed "proceedings in any court of a State" comprehensively, and as embracing</p>\n<p>"all steps taken or which may be taken in the state court or by its officers from the institution to the close of the final process.  It applies to appellate, as well as to original, proceedings, and is independent of the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em>  It applies alike to action by the court and by its ministerial officers; applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment, but to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 405 U. S. 559</a></p><p> taken with a view to making the suit or judgment effective."</p>\n<p>(Footnotes omitted.)  The Court today embarks on quite a different course, and rejects not only <em>Hill v. Martin,</em> but also a substantial body of federal court of appeals law to the effect that \xc2\xa7 2283 bars federal court interference with executions on state court judgments.  <em>E.g., Manufacturers Record Publishing Co. v. Lauer,</em> 268 F.2d 187 (CA5), <em>cert. denied,</em> 361 U.S. 913 (1959); <em>Furnish v. Board of Medical Examiners of California,</em> 257 F.2d 520 (CA9), <em>cert. denied,</em> 358 U.S. 882 (1958); <em>Norwood v. Parenteau,</em> 228 F.2d 148 (CA8 1955), <em>cert. denied,</em> 351 U.S. 955 (1956). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court also suggests that \xc2\xa7 2283 is inapplicable here because no Connecticut court authorized the garnishment.  Its view apparently is that a federal injunction would therefore not interfere with state court processes.  Until now, however, it has been reasonably clear that \xc2\xa7 2283 cannot be avoided by the simple expedient of enjoining parties, instead of judges.  <em>Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html">309 U. S. 4</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/4/case.html#9">309 U. S. 9</a></span> (1940).  Moreover, the Court\'s rationale proves too much.  Contrary to the views expressed in <em>Hill v. Martin, supra,</em> state court ministerial officers could be enjoined at any time and for any purpose in the course of a litigation, and without regard to \xc2\xa7 2283.  In addition, parties to state court litigation could be enjoined from performing any one or all of the tasks essential to the orderly progress of litigation, so long as the acts in question are not carried out pursuant to court order.  Depositions of parties and witnesses, interrogatories to parties, and subpoenas for witnesses are commonly pursued </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 405 U. S. 560</a></p><p> without resort to a judge.  Are these and other functions not performed under court order now subject to attack in federal court at the option of the offended state court litigant?</p>\n<p>Today\'s decision will, I fear, create confusion by making the applicability of \xc2\xa7 2283 turn on rules that are difficult to apply.  The potential for conflict between state and federal courts will increase, and the price for judicial errors will be paid by litigants and courts alike.  The common sense of the matter, it seems to me, is that the garnishment at issue here is part and parcel of a state court proceeding now under way.  Garnishment in Connecticut may be characterized as separate from the underlying action, but it is nonetheless a proceeding, and derives its legitimacy from the suit it accompanies.  At the time this federal action was brought, return of process had long since been completed and the state court had acquired jurisdiction of a straightforward cause of action, including questions of the legitimacy and constitutionality of the garnishment.</p>\n<p>It also seems to me that, quite apart from \xc2\xa7 2283, today\'s holding departs from such cases as <em>Stefanelli v. Minard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/117/case.html">342 U. S. 117</a></span> (1951), and <em>Perez v. Ledesma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html">401 U. S. 82</a></span> (1971), which counsel against atomizing state litigation by enjoining, for example, the introduction of illegally obtained evidence, as well as from the more general admonitions of <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971); <em>Samuels v.
