The California Supreme Court was mistaken in presuming that it could resolve the disposition of petitioner\'s claim to judicially immunized testimony at the penalty phase of a capital proceeding by the same standard used to assess a defendant\'s right to immunized testimony at trial. It is well established that a criminal defendant\'s entitlement to present useful evidence is at its strongest in the capital sentencing context; this Court has repeatedly emphasized that the State may not exclude "any relevant mitigating evidence offered by the defendant as the basis for a sentence less than death." Penry v. Lynaugh, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#318">492 U.S. 302, 318</a>, 2946, 106 L. Ed.2d 256 (1989) (emphasis added); accord, Skipper v. South Carolina, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/case.html#4">476 U.S. 1, 4</a>, 1671 (1986); Eddings v. Oklahoma, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/case.html">455 U.S. 104</a>, 114-115, 876-877 (1982). Assuming that a criminal defendant does have the due process right to judicially immunized testimony recognized by the Third Circuit in Smith, the assessment whether a capital defendant has satisfied the threshold showing of need must take account of that defendant\'s heightened entitlement to present all mitigating evidence to the sentencer. Cf. Green v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/95/case.html#97">442 U.S. 95, 97</a>, 2151-2152 (1979) (holding that exclusion of mitigating evidence at penalty phase of capital proceeding through operation of generally applicable state hearsay rule denied defendant "a fair trial on the issue of punishment" and thus violated due process). A court could not, in my view, deny the defendant\'s request, as the California Supreme Court did, simply because the mitigating testimony sought by the defendant was not "highly relevant" or because overlapping evidence "had already been presented" to the sentencer. In sum, if a defendant has a right to judicially immunized testimony, petitioner\'s death sentence cannot stand. </p><p> I would grant the petition so that this Court can determine whether a criminal defendant has a due process right to judicially immunized testimony, and, if so, what standards govern immunized-testimony requests in capital sentencing proceedings. Consequently, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. </p><p> Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#231">428 U.S. 153, 231</a>, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would also grant the petition and vacate the death penalty in this case even if I did not regard the petition as presenting a question independently meriting this Court\'s review.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
