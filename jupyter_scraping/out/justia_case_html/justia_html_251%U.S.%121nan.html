JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In a proceeding under the Workmen\'s Compensation Law of Louisiana (No. 20, Acts La.1914), the supreme court of that state affirmed a judgment against plaintiffs in error and in favor of Veasey, who claimed to have suffered injuries, August 6, 1915, while employed by Henry </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 251 U. S. 122</a></p><p> and Eugene Peters as a longshoreman on board the <em>Seria,</em> then lying at New Orleans.  The steamer was being unloaded.  While upon her and engaged in that work, Veasey accidentally fell through a hatchway.  <em>Veasey v. Peters,</em> 142 La. 1012.</p>\n<p>A compensation policy in favor of Peters, issued by the Aetna Life Insurance Company, was in force when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p>The work in which defendant in error was engaged is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries which he received were likewise maritime, and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction.  In such circumstances, the workmen\'s compensation Law of the state had no application when the accident occurred.  <em>Atlantic Transport Co. v.

The court below erroneously concluded that this act should be given retroactive effect, and applied in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 251 U. S. 123</a></p><p> present controversy.  There is nothing in the language employed, nor is there any circumstance known to us, which indicates a purpose to make the act applicable when the cause of action arose before its passage, and we think it must not be so construed.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
