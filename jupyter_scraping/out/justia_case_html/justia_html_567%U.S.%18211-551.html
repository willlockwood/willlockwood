During each of those FYs, Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay any individual tribal contractor\xe2\x80\x99s contract support costs in full but did not appropriate enough to pay all tribal contractors collectively.  Unable to pay every contractor in full, the Secretary paid the Tribes on a uniform, pro\xc2\xa0rata basis.  Respondents sued under the Contract Disputes Act for breach of contract.

Leavitt, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631\n, this Court considered the Government\xe2\x80\x99s promise to pay contract support costs in ISDA self-determination contracts that made the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the availability of appropriations,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 634\xe2\x88\x92637.  The Government contended that Congress appropriated inadequate funds to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Tribes, while meeting the agency\xe2\x80\x99s competing fiscal priorities.  Because Congress appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts, however, the Court held that the Government was obligated to pay those costs in full absent \xe2\x80\x9csomething special about the promises,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat conclusion followed directly from well-established principles of Government contracting law: When a Government contractor is one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient in itself to pay the contractor, the Government is responsible to the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible ends.  See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546.  That is so \xe2\x80\x9ceven if an agency\xe2\x80\x99s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all\xe2\x80\x9d of its contracts.  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.  This principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States.  Contractors need not keep track of agencies\xe2\x80\x99 shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its contractual promises.  And the rule furthers \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government\xe2\x80\x99s own long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad workaday transaction of its agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

Once \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise on grounds of \xe2\x80\x98insufficient appropriations,\xe2\x80\x99 even if the contract uses language such as \xe2\x80\x98subject to the availability of appropriations,\xe2\x80\x99 and even if an agency\xe2\x80\x99s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.  That condition is satisfied here, because Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual contractor in full.

The effect of the appropriations in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress identified.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d language still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 450j\xe2\x80\x931(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for one tribe\xe2\x80\x99s programs to make funds available to another tribe, does not warrant a different result.  Consistent with ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely underscores the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to allocate funds among tribes.  It does not alter the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legal obligation when the Secretary fails to pay.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, it suggests that the Secretary could violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prevents federal officers from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation.  That Act applies only to government officials, however, and does not affect the rights of citizens contracting with the Government.  Second, the Government argues that permitting respondents to recover from the Judgment Fund would circumvent Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to cap total expenditures for contract support costs.  But ISDA expressly provides that tribal contractors may sue for \xe2\x80\x9cmoney damages\xe2\x80\x9d under the Contract Disputes Act, and any ensuing judgments are payable from the Judgment Fund.  See Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 642.  Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts have rejected contractors\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to recover for amounts beyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose.  See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, \n\n256 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575\n.  However, Sutton involved a specific line-item appropriation for an amount beyond which the sole contractor could not recover.  This case involves several contractors, each of whom contracted within the lump-sum amount Congress appropriated for all contractors.  Unlike the sole contractor in Sutton, they cannot reasonably be expected to know how much remained available of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 lump-sum appropriation.  Finally, the Government claims that legislative history suggests that Congress approved of pro\xc2\xa0rata distribution, but \xe2\x80\x9cindicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirement on the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lincoln v.

ISDA mandates that the Secretary shall pay the full amount of \xe2\x80\x9ccontract support costs\xe2\x80\x9d incurred by tribes in performing their contracts.  At issue in this case is whether the Government must pay those costs when Congress appropriates sufficient funds to pay in full any individual contractor\xe2\x80\x99s contract support costs, but not enough funds to cover the aggregate amount due every contractor.  Consistent with longstanding principles of Government contracting law, we hold that the Government must pay each tribe\xe2\x80\x99s contract support costs in full.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress enacted ISDA in 1975 in order to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum Indian participation in the direction of educational as well as other Federal services to Indian communities so as to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7450a(a).

It soon became apparent that this secretarial amount failed to account for the full costs to tribes of providing services.

The Government contended, however, that Congress had appropriated inadequate funds to enable the IHS to pay the Tribes\xe2\x80\x99 contract support costs in full, while meeting all of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s competing fiscal priorities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we explained, that did not excuse the Government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay the Tribes.  We stressed that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to pay contract support costs should be treated as an ordinary contract promise, noting that ISDA \xe2\x80\x9cuses the word \xe2\x80\x98contract\xe2\x80\x99 426 times to describe the nature of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s promise.\xe2\x80\x9d Id., at 639.  As even the Government conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cin the case of ordinary contracts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98if the amount of an unrestricted appropriation is sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment even if the agency has allocated the funds to another purpose or assumes other obligations that exhaust the funds.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 641.  It followed, therefore, that absent \xe2\x80\x9csomething special about the promises at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government was obligated to pay the Tribes\xe2\x80\x99 contract support costs in full.

Id., at 643 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That commonplace provision, we explained, is ordinarily satisfied so long as Congress appropriates adequate legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue.  See ibid.  Because Congress made sufficient funds legally available to the agency to pay the Tribes\xe2\x80\x99 contracts, it did not matter that the BIA had allocated some of those funds to serve other purposes, such that the remainder was insufficient to pay the Tribes in full.  Rather, we agreed with the Tribes that \xe2\x80\x9cas long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s promise to pay was binding.

When a Government contractor is one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient in itself to pay the contractor, it has long been the rule that the Government is responsible to the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible ends.  See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546 (1892); Dougherty v. United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 496, 503 (1883); see also 2 GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, p. 6\xe2\x80\x9317 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter GAO Redbook).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That is so \xe2\x80\x9ceven if an agency\xe2\x80\x99s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.   In such cases, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he United States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lynch v. United States, \n\n292 U.\xc2\xa0S. 571, \n580 (1934)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the agency itself cannot disburse funds beyond those appropriated to it, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvalid obligations will remain enforceable in the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  GAO Redbook, p. 6\xe2\x80\x9317.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States.  For contractors, the Ferris rule reflects that when \xe2\x80\x9ca contract is but one activity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the contractor to know how much of that appropriation remains available for it at any given time.\xe2\x80\x9d  GAO Redbook, p. 6\xe2\x80\x9318.  Contractors are responsible for knowing the size of the pie, not how the agency elects to slice it.  Thus, so long as Congress appropriates adequate funds to cover a prospective contract, contractors need not keep track of agencies\xe2\x80\x99 shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its contractual promises.  Dougherty, 18 Ct. Cl., at 503.  In such cases, if an agency overcommits its funds such that it cannot fulfill its contractual commitments, even the Government has acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he risk of over-obligation may be found to fall on the agency,\xe2\x80\x9d not the contractor.

If the Government could be trusted to fulfill its promise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did not arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily\xe2\x80\x94if at all\xe2\x80\x94and only at a premium large enough to account for the risk of nonpayment.  See, e.g., Logue, Tax Transitions, Opportunistic Retroactivity, and the Benefits of Government Precommitment, 94 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1129, 1146 (1996).

Once \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on grounds of \xe2\x80\x98insufficient appropriations,\xe2\x80\x99 even if the contract uses language such as \xe2\x80\x98subject to the availability of appropriations,\xe2\x80\x99 and even if an agency\xe2\x80\x99s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637; see also id., at 638 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Government denies none of this\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat condition is satisfied here.  In each FY between 1994 and 2001, Congress appropriated to the BIA a lump-sum from which \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d between $91 and $125 million was allocated for contract support costs, an amount that exceeded the sum due any tribal contractor.  Within those constraints, the ability to direct those funds was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98committed to agency discretion by law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lincoln v.

Nothing, for instance, prevented the BIA from paying in full respondent Ramah Navajo Chapter\xe2\x80\x99s contract support costs rather than other tribes\xe2\x80\x99, whether based on its greater need or simply because it sought payment first.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See International Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v.

(\xe2\x80\x9cA lump-sum appropriation leaves it to the recipient agency (as a matter of law, at least) to distribute the funds among some or all of the permissible objects as it sees fit\xe2\x80\x9d).  And if there was any doubt that that general rule applied here, ISDA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory language itself makes clear that the BIA may allocate funds to one tribe at the expense of another.  See \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal or- ganization under this [Act]\xe2\x80\x9d).  The upshot is that the funds appropriated by Congress were legally available to pay any individual tribal contractor in full.  See 1 GAO Redbook, p. 4\xe2\x80\x936 (3d ed. 2004).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s contractual promise to pay each tribal contractor the \xe2\x80\x9cfull amount of funds to which the contractor [was] entitled,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(g), was therefore binding.

Under our previous interpretation of that language, that condition was satisfied here because Congress appropriated adequate funds to pay in full any individual contractor.  It is important to afford that language a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d in this and comparable statutes, \xe2\x80\x9clest legal uncertainty undermine contractors\xe2\x80\x99 confidence that they will be paid, and in turn increase the cost to the Government of purchasing goods and services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It would be particularly anomalous to read the statutory language differently here. Contracts made under ISDA specify that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]ach provision of the [ISDA] and each provision of this Contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Contractor.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7450l(c), (model agreement \xc2\xa71(a)(2)).  The Government, in effect, must demonstrate that its reading is clearly required by the statutory language.  Accordingly, the Government cannot back out of its contractual promise to pay each Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s full contract support costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government primarily seeks to distinguish this case from Cherokee Nation and Ferris on the ground that Congress here appropriated \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a given amount for contract support costs, thereby imposing an express cap on the total funds available.  See Brief for Petitioners 26, 49.  The Government argues, on this basis, that Ferris and Cherokee Nation involved \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts made against the back- drop of unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations,\xe2\x80\x9d while this case does not.  See Brief for Petitioners 49, 26.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat premise, however, is inaccurate.  In Ferris, Congress appropriated \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or improving Delaware River below Bridesburg, Pennsylvania, forty-five thousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n20Stat.\n364.  As explained in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own appropriations law handbook, the \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d language at issue in this case has an identical meaning to the quoted language in Ferris.  See GAO Redbook, p. 6\xe2\x80\x935 (\xe2\x80\x9cWords like \xe2\x80\x98not to exceed\xe2\x80\x99 are not the only way to establish a maximum limitation.  If the appropriation includes a specific amount for a particular object (such as \xe2\x80\x98For Cuban cigars, $100\xe2\x80\x99), then the appropriation is a maximum which may not be exceeded\xe2\x80\x9d).  The appropriation in Cherokee Nation took a similar form.  See, e.g., \n\n108Stat.\n2527\xe2\x80\x932528 (\xe2\x80\x9cFor expenses necessary to carry out .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ISDA [and certain other enumerated Acts], $1,713,052,000\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no ba- sis, therefore, for distinguishing the class of appropria- tion in those cases from this one.  In each case, the agency remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress identified.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis result does not leave the \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d language in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 appropriation without legal effect.  To the contrary, it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming other funds to pay contract support costs\xe2\x80\x94thereby protecting funds that Congress envisioned for other BIA programs, including tribes that choose not to enter ISDA contracts.  But when an agency makes competing contractual commitments with legally available funds and then fails to pay, it is the Government that must bear the fiscal consequences, not the contractor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent attempts to distinguish this case from Cherokee Nation and Ferris on different grounds, relying on \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b)\xe2\x80\x99s proviso that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serv- ing a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, that clause establishes that each dol- lar allocated by the Secretary reduces the amount of appropriations legally available to pay other contractors.  In effect, the dissent understands \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) to make the legal availability of appropriations turn on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures rather than the sum allocated by Congress.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat interpretation, which is inconsistent with ordinary principles of Government contracting law, is improbable.  We have explained that Congress ordinarily controls the availability of appropriations; the agency controls whether to make funds from that appropriation available to pay a contractor.  See Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 642\xe2\x80\x93643.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s allocation choices do not affect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s liability in the event of an underpayment.  See id., at 641 (when an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unrestricted appropriation is sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment even if the agency has allocated the funds to another purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In Cherokee Nation, we found those ordinary principles generally applicable to ISDA.

As we explained, su- pra, at 9, the clause underscores the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discre- tion to allocate funds among tribes, but does not alter the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legal obligation when the agency fails to pay.  That reading gives full effect to the clause\xe2\x80\x99s text, which addresses the \xe2\x80\x9camount of funds provided,\xe2\x80\x9d and specifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for one tribe to make \xe2\x80\x9cfunds available\xe2\x80\x9d to another.  450j\xe2\x80\x931(b).

See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, \n\n256 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1921)\n.  In Sutton, for instance, Congress made a specific line-item appropriation of $23,000 for the completion of a particular project.  Id., at 577.  We held that the sole contractor engaged to complete that project could not recover more than that amount for his work.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ferris and Sutton lines of cases are distinguishable, however.  GAO Redbook, p. 6\xe2\x80\x9318.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is settled that contractors paid from a general appropriation are not barred from recovering for breach of contract even though the appropriation is exhausted,\xe2\x80\x9d but that \xe2\x80\x9cunder a specific line-item appropriation, the answer is different.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The different results \xe2\x80\x9cfollo[w] logically from the old maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular contract, that amount is specified in the appropriation act and the contractor is deemed to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This case is far different.  Hundreds of tribes entered into thousands of independent contracts, each for amounts well within the lump sum appropriated by Congress to pay contract support costs.  Here, where each Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontract is but one activity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect [each] contractor to know how much of that appropriation remain[ed] available for it at any given time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see also Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government argues that legislative history suggests that Congress approved of the distribution of available funds on a uniform, pro rata basis.  But \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lincoln, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted). \xe2\x80\x9c[I]ndicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on the agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to spend appropriated funds is cabined only by the \xe2\x80\x9ctext of the appropriation,\xe2\x80\x9d not by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expectations of how the funds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative history.  Int\xe2\x80\x99l Union, UAW, 746 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 860\xe2\x80\x93861.  That principle also reflects the same ideas underlying Ferris.  If a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s right to payment varied based on a future court\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain interpretation of legislative history, it would increase the Government\xe2\x80\x99s cost of contracting.  Cf. Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 644. That long-run expense would likely far exceed whatever money might be saved in any individual case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Government points out, the state of affairs resulting in this case is the product of two congressional decisions which the BIA has found difficult to reconcile.  On the one hand, Congress obligated the Secretary to accept every qualifying ISDA contract, which includes a promise of \xe2\x80\x9cfull\xe2\x80\x9d funding for all contract support costs.  On the other, Congress appropriated insufficient funds to pay in full each tribal contractor.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s frustration is understandable, but the dilemma\xe2\x80\x99s resolution is the responsibility of Congress.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress is not short of options.  For instance, it could reduce the Government\xe2\x80\x99s financial obligation by amending ISDA to remove the statutory mandate compelling the BIA to enter into self-determination contracts, or by giving the BIA flexibility to pay less than the full amount of contract support costs.  It could also pass a moratorium on the formation of new self-determination contracts, as it has done before.  See \xc2\xa7328, \n\n112Stat.\n2681\xe2\x80\x93291 to 292.  Or Congress could elect to make line-item appropriations, allocating funds to cover tribes\xe2\x80\x99 contract support costs on a contractor-by-contractor basis.  On the other hand, Con- gress could appropriate sufficient funds to the BIA to meet the tribes\xe2\x80\x99 total contract support cost needs.  Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress may do just that.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 112\xe2\x80\x93151, p. 42 (2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee believes that the Bureau should pay all contract support costs for which it has contractually agreed and directs the Bureau to include the full cost of the contract support obligations in its fiscal year 2013 budget submission\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe desirability of these options is not for us to say.  We make clear only that Congress has ample means at hand to resolve the situation underlying the Tribes\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  Any one of the options above could also promote transparency about the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal obligations with respect to ISDA\xe2\x80\x99s directive that contract support costs be paid in full.  For the period in question, however, it is the Govern- ment\xe2\x80\x94not the Tribes\xe2\x80\x94that must bear the consequences of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to mandate that the Government enter into binding contracts for which its appropriation was sufficient to pay any individual tribal contractor, but \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cherokee Nation, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0As defined by ISDA, contract support costs \xe2\x80\x9cshall consist of an amount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on by a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and prudent management, but which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s real argument is that \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) reverses the applicability of the Ferris rule to ISDA, so that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of funds to one contractor reduces the legal availability of funds to others.  See post, at 4 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Secretary could have allocated the funds to [a] tribe is irrelevant.  What matters is what the Secretary does, and once he allocates the funds to one tribe, they are not available to another\xe2\x80\x9d).  We are not persuaded that \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) was intended to enact that radical departure from ordinary Government contracting principles.

First, in each annual appropriations statute for the Depart- ment of the Interior from fiscal year 1994 to 2001, Congress provided that spending on contract support costs for all tribes was \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a certain amount.  The fiscal year 1995 appropriations statute is representative.  It provided: \xe2\x80\x9cFor operation of Indian programs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , $1,526,778,000, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of which not to exceed $95,823,000 shall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for contract support costs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n108Stat.\n2510\xe2\x80\x932511.

But the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause in \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) expressly provides that the Secretary is \xe2\x80\x9cnot required\xe2\x80\x9d to engage in such reprogramming to make one tribe\xe2\x80\x99s funds \xe2\x80\x9cavailable to another tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  It follows that appropriations allocated for \xe2\x80\x9cprograms, projects, or activities serving a tribe\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to another tribe, unless the Secretary reallocates them.  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, the Government shares this view that the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically relieves the Secretary of any obligation to make funds available to one contractor by reducing payments to others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 51 (citing Arctic Slope Native Assn., Ltd. v.

The Court agrees.  Ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  That leaves only one other possible source of funds to pay the disputed costs in this case: funds appropriated for contract support costs, but allocated to pay such costs incurred by other tribes.  Those funds were not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d either, however, because they were \xe2\x80\x9cfunding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Secretary was not required to reduce such funding \xe2\x80\x9cto make funds available to another tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court fails to appreciate the full significance of the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause in \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b).  As construed by the Court, that clause merely confirms that the Secretary \xe2\x80\x9cmay allocate funds to one tribe at the expense of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  But as explained above, the clause does more than that: It also establishes that when the Secretary does allocate funds to one tribe at the expense of another, the latter tribe has no right to those funds\xe2\x80\x94the funds are not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to it.  The fact that the Secretary could have allocated the funds to the other tribe is irrelevant.  What matters is what the Secretary actually does, and once he allocates the funds to one tribe, they are not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to another.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court rejects this reading of the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause, on the ground that it would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cradical departure from ordinary Government contracting principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa06.  But the fact that the clause operates as a constraint on the \xe2\x80\x9cavailability of appropriations\xe2\x80\x9d is evident not only from its text, which speaks in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cfunds available,\xe2\x80\x9d but also from its placement in the statute, immediately following the \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the availability\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, by contrast, the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause merely \xe2\x80\x9cunderscores the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to allocate funds among tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  There is, however, no reason to suppose that Congress enacted the provision simply to confirm this \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d rule.  Ibid.  We generally try to avoid reading statutes to be so \xe2\x80\x9cinsig- nificant.\xe2\x80\x9d  TRW Inc. v.

Leavitt, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631 (2005)\n.  Ante, at 8.  Like respondents here, the tribes in Cherokee Nation sued the Government for unpaid contract support costs under the Act.  Congress had appropriated certain sums to the Indian Health Service \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or expenses necessary to carry out\xe2\x80\x9d the Act, e.g., \n\n108Stat.\n2527\xe2\x80\x932528, but\xe2\x80\x94unlike in this case\xe2\x80\x94those appropriations \xe2\x80\x9ccontained no relevant statutory restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.  The Government in Cherokee Nation contended that it was not obligated to pay the contract support costs as promised, in light of the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause in \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b).  The Government argued that the clause \xe2\x80\x9cmakes nonbinding a promise to pay one tribe\xe2\x80\x99s costs where doing so would require funds that the Government would otherwise devote to \xe2\x80\x98programs, projects, or activities serving .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an- other tribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 641 (quoting \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe ruled against the Government, but not because of any disagreement with its reading of the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  The basis for our decision was instead that \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant congressional appropriations contained other unrestricted funds, small in amount but sufficient to pay the claims at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 641 (emphasis altered).  Those funds were allocated for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inherent federal functions,\xe2\x80\x99 such as the cost of running the Indian Health Service\xe2\x80\x99s central Washington office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 641\xe2\x80\x93642.  They were not restricted by the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause, because they were not funds for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98programs, projects, or activities serving .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. another tribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 641 (quoting \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b)).  Nor were they restricted by the pertinent appropriations statutes, which, as noted, contained no relevant limiting language.  See ibid.  We therefore held that those funds\xe2\x80\x94which we described as \xe2\x80\x9cunrestricted\xe2\x80\x9d throughout our opinion, id., at 641, 642, 643, 647\xe2\x80\x94were available to pay the disputed contract support costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs even the Tribes concede, Cherokee Nation does not control this case.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this case is controlled by Cherokee\xe2\x80\x9d (counsel for the Tribes)).  The reason is not that the appropriations statutes in this case contained \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d caps while those in Cherokee Nation did not.  The Court is correct that appropriating an amount \xe2\x80\x9cfor\xe2\x80\x9d a particular purpose has the same effect as providing that appropriations for that purpose are \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d that amount.  Ante, at 11.  What makes this case different is where Congress drew the line.  In Cherokee Nation, the statutes capped funding for \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses necessary to carry out\xe2\x80\x9d the Act, a category that included funding for both \xe2\x80\x9cinherent federal functions\xe2\x80\x9d and contract support costs.  Accordingly, funding for one could be used for the other, without violating the cap.  Here, by contrast, the statutes capped funding for contract support costs specifically.  Thus, once the Secretary exhausted those funds, he could not reprogram other funds\xe2\x80\x94such as funds for \xe2\x80\x9cinherent federal functions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to pay the costs.  With the caps in place, moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9creduction\xe2\x80\x9d clause, as explained above, rendered unavailable the only possible source of funds left: funds already allocated for other contract support costs.  Unlike in Cherokee Nation, therefore, there were no unrestricted funds to pay the costs at issue in this case.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s quotation from Cherokee Nation concerning \xe2\x80\x9cwhen an \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cunrestricted appropriation is sufficient to fund the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 12 (emphasis added) (quoting Cherokee Nation, supra, at 641), is accordingly beside the point.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also relies on Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542 (1892).  That case involved a government contract to dredge the Delaware River.  When work under the contract stopped because funds from the relevant appropriation had been exhausted, a contractor sued the Government for breach of contract, and the Court of Claims held that he was entitled to recover lost profits.  As the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its administration, nor can his legal rights be affected or impaired by its maladministration or by its diversion, whether legal or illegal, to other objects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 546.  That principle, however, cannot \xe2\x80\x9cdictate the result in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  The statute in Ferris appropriated an amount \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or improving [the] Delaware River,\xe2\x80\x9d which prevented spending for that purpose beyond the specified amount.  \n\n20Stat.\n364.  But in that case, all funds appropriated for that purpose were equally avail- able to all contractors.  Here that is not true; \xc2\xa7450j\xe2\x80\x931(b) makes clear that funds allocated to one contractor are not available to another.  Thus, the principle in Ferris does not apply.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 10, that each of the Tribes\xe2\x80\x99 contracts provides that the Act and the contract \xe2\x80\x9cshall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Contractor.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 203; see also \xc2\xa7450l(c) (Model Agreement \xc2\xa71(a)(2)).  But a provision can be construed \xe2\x80\x9cliberally\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly\xe2\x80\x9d only when there is some ambiguity to construe.  And here there is none.  Congress spoke clearly when it said that the provision of funds was \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the availability of appropriations,\xe2\x80\x9d that spending on contract support costs was \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a specific amount, and that the Secretary was \xe2\x80\x9cnot required\xe2\x80\x9d to make funds allocated for one tribe\xe2\x80\x99s costs \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to another.  The unambiguous meaning of these provisions is that when the Secretary has allocated the maximum amount of funds appropriated each fiscal year for contract support costs, there are no other appropriations \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to pay any remaining costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is hardly a typical government contracts case.  Many government contracts contain a \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the availability of appropriations\xe2\x80\x9d clause, and many appropriations statutes contain \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d language.  But this case involves not only those provisions but a third, relieving the Secretary of any obligation to make funds \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to one contractor by reducing payments to others.  Such provisions will not always appear together, but when they do, we must give them effect.  Doing so here, I would hold that the Tribes are not entitled to payment of their contract support costs in full, and I would reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
