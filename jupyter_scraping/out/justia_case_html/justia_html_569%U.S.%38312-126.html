Perkins, however, testified that Jones and Henderson left him during the evening, and that he later saw Jones with blood on his clothing.

To overcome AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limitations, he asserted newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, relying on three affidavits, the most recent dated July 16, 2002, each pointing to Jones as the murderer.  The District Court found that, even if the affidavits could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period.  Alternatively, the court found, Perkins had not shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror would have convicted him.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  Acknowledging that Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 petition was untimely and that he had not diligently pursued his rights, the court held that Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 actual-innocence claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it had been filed on time.  In so ruling, the court apparently considered Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 delay irrelevant to appraisal of his actual-innocence claim.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup v.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions support his view.  The Court has not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding actual-innocence claim, Herrera v. Collins, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 390\n\xe2\x80\x93405, but it has recognized that a prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 404.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has applied this \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental miscarriage of justice exception\xe2\x80\x9d to overcome various procedural defaults, including, as most relevant here, failure to observe state procedural rules, such as filing deadlines.  See Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722\n.  The exception, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions bear out, survived AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  See, e.g., Calderon v. Thompson, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538\n; House, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 537\xe2\x80\x93538.  These decisions \xe2\x80\x9csee[k] to balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schlup, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 324.  Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.

That is not so, for AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limitations apply to the typical case in which no actual-innocence claim is made, while the exception applies to a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows \xe2\x80\x9cit is more likely than not that \xe2\x80\x98no reasonable juror\xe2\x80\x99 would have convicted [the petitioner],\xe2\x80\x9d Schlup, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329.  Many petitions that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be timely or not measured by \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(D)\xe2\x80\x99s triggering provision.  Nor does Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) indicate an intent to preclude courts from applying the exception in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(D) cases.  Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).  Rather, Congress constrained the exception\xe2\x80\x99s application with respect to second-or-successive petitions and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court.  The more rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified version of the exception into other provisions of AEDPA is that, in a case not governed by those provisions, the exception survived AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage intact and unrestricted.

A petitioner invoking the miscarriage of justice exception \xe2\x80\x9cmust show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schlup, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 327.  Unexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing.  Taking account of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s actual-innocence claim, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry, is tuned to the exception\xe2\x80\x99s underlying rationale of ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cthat federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Herrera, 506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404.

In those cases, a convincing showing of actual innocence enabled habeas petitioners to overcome a procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their constitutional claims.  Here, the question arises in the context of \n\n28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1), the statute of limitations on federal habeas petitions prescribed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.  Specifically, if the petitioner does not file her federal habeas peti- tion, at the latest, within one year of \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(D), can the time bar be overcome by a convincing showing that she committed no crime?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe hold that actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup and House, or, as in this case, expiration of the statute of limitations.  We caution, however, that tenable actual-innocence gateway pleas are rare: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] petitioner does not meet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the district court that, in light of the new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329; see House, 547 U. S., at 538 (emphasizing that the Schlup standard is \xe2\x80\x9cdemanding\xe2\x80\x9d and seldom met).  And in making an assessment of the kind Schlup envisioned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe timing of the [petition]\xe2\x80\x9d is a factor bearing on the \xe2\x80\x9creliability of th[e] evidence\xe2\x80\x9d purporting to show actual innocence.

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court denying Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 petition, and held that Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 actual-innocence claim allowed him to pursue his habeas petition as if it had been filed on time.  670 F.\xc2\xa03d 665, 670 (2012).

That is so, the State maintains, because AEDPA prescribes a comprehensive system for determining when its one-year limitations period begins to run.  \xe2\x80\x9cIncluded within that system,\xe2\x80\x9d the State observes, \xe2\x80\x9cis a specific trigger for the precise circumstance presented here: a constitutional claim based on new evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Section 2244(d)(1)(D) runs the clock from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  In light of that provision, the State urges, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no need for the courts to act in equity to provide additional time for persons who allege actual innocence as a gateway to their claims of constitutional error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 request for an equitable exception to the statute of limitations, the State charges, would \xe2\x80\x9crende[r] superfluous this carefully scripted scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 18.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State\xe2\x80\x99s argument in this regard bears blinders.  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limitations apply to the typical case in which no allegation of actual innocence is made.  The miscarriage of justice exception, we underscore, applies to a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows \xe2\x80\x9cit is more likely than not that no reasonable ju- ror would have convicted [the petitioner].\xe2\x80\x9d  Schlup, 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 2244(d)(1)(D) is both modestly more stringent (because it requires diligence) and dramatically less stringent (because it requires no showing of innocence).  Many petitions that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be timely or not measured by \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(D)\xe2\x80\x99s triggering provision.  That provision, in short, will hardly be rendered superfluous by recognition of the miscarriage of justice exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State further relies on provisions of AEDPA other than \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(D), namely, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e) (2), to urge that Congress knew how to incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception when it was so minded.  Section 2244(b)(2)(B), the State observes, provides that a petitioner whose first federal habeas petition has already been adjudicated when new evidence comes to light may file a second-or-successive petition when, and only when, the facts underlying the new claim would \xe2\x80\x9ces-tablish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B)(ii).  And \xc2\xa72254(e)(2), which generally bars evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings ini-tiated by state prisoners, includes an exception for pris-oners who present new evidence of their innocence.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B) (permitting evidentiary hearings in federal court if \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).  Rather, Congress constrained the application of the exception.  Prior to AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, a court could grant relief on a second-or-successive petition, then known as an \xe2\x80\x9cabusive\xe2\x80\x9d petition, if the petitioner could show that \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCleskey, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 495.  Section 2244(b)(2)(B) limits the exception to cases in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d and the petitioner can establish that no reasonable factfinder \xe2\x80\x9cwould have found [her] guilty of the underlying offense\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress thus required second-or-successive habeas petitioners attempting to benefit from the miscarriage of justice exception to meet a higher level of proof (\xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d) and to satisfy a diligence requirement that did not exist prior to AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLikewise, petitioners asserting actual innocence pre-AEDPA could obtain evidentiary hearings in federal court even if they failed to develop facts in state court.

See Brief for Respondent 52 (unjustified delay may figure in determining \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a petitioner has made a sufficient showing of innocence\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we stated in Schlup, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] court may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of [a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] affiants bear on the probable reliability of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. evidence [of actual innocence].\xe2\x80\x9d  513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 332.

The timing of such a petition, however, should seriously undermine the credibility of the actual-innocence claim.  Moreover, the deceased witness\xe2\x80\x99 prior testimony, which would have been subject to cross-examination, could be introduced in the event of a new trial.  See Crawford v. Washington, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36\n\xe2\x80\x9354 (2004) (recognizing exception to the Confrontation Clause where witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination).  And frivolous petitions should occasion instant dismissal.  See \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 Rule 4.  Focusing on the merits of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s actual-innocence claim and taking account of delay in that context, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry, is tuned to the rationale underlying the miscarriage of justice exception\xe2\x80\x94i.e., ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cthat federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Herrera, 506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe now return to the case at hand.  The District Court proceeded properly in first determining that Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 claim was filed well beyond AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period and that equitable tolling was unavailable to Perkins because he could demonstrate neither exceptional circumstances nor diligence.  See supra, at 5.  The District Court then found that Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 alleged newly discovered evidence, i.e., the information contained in the three affidavits, was \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially available to [Perkins] at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\tApp. to Pet. for Cert. 31a.

We have explained that untimeliness, although not an unyielding ground for dismissal of a petition, does bear on the credibility of evidence proffered to show actual innocence.  On remand, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 petition as insufficient to meet Schlup\xe2\x80\x99s actual-innocence standard should be dispositive, absent cause, which we do not currently see, for the Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation.  We stress once again that the Schlup standard is demanding.  The gateway should open only when a petition presents \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error.\xe2\x80\x9d  513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 316.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In House, we rejected the analogous argument that AEDPA re-placed the standard for actual-innocence gateway claims prescribed in Schlup v.

Zant, \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 467, \n489 (1991)\n (abuse of the writ), to limit the ha- beas practice that it had radically expanded in the early or mid-20th century to include review of the merits of conviction and not merely jurisdiction of the convicting court, see Stone v. Powell, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465\n\xe2\x80\x93478 (1976) (citing Frank v. Mangum, \n\n237 U.\xc2\xa0S. 309 (1915)\n); Brown v.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 441, 483\xe2\x80\x93499 (1963).  For example, the doctrine of procedural default holds that a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s default of his federal claims \xe2\x80\x9cin state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule\xe2\x80\x9d bars federal habeas review of those claims.  Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722, \n750 (1991)\n.  That doctrine is not a statutory or ju- risdictional command; rather, it is a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d rule \xe2\x80\x9cgrounded in \xe2\x80\x98considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Dretke v.

As relevant here, we have also expressed a willingness to excuse a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s default, even absent a showing of cause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Murray v.

Where a petitioner would, but for a judge-made doctrine like procedural default, have a good habeas claim, it offends no command of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s for a federal court to consider the petition.  But that free-and-easy approach has no place where a statutory bar to habeas relief is at issue.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,\xe2\x80\x9d Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.), and \xe2\x80\x9cjudgments about the proper scope of the writ are \xe2\x80\x98normally for Congress to make,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Felker v.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s insupportable leap from judge-made procedural bars to all procedural bars, including statutory bars, does all the work in its opinion\xe2\x80\x94and there is not a whit of precedential support for it.  McCleskey v. Zant applied a \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage of justice\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the judge-made abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.  499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487\xe2\x80\x93489, 495.  Coleman v. Thompson and Murray v. Carrier applied it to the judge-made procedural-default doctrine.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 750; 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 496.  Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1992)\n, applied it to a variant of procedural default: a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s failure adequately to develop material facts in state court.  Id., at 8.  Kuhlmann v. Wilson, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1986)\n, a plurality opinion, applied it to a statute that merely said lower federal courts \xe2\x80\x9cneed not\xe2\x80\x9d entertain successive petitions, thus leaving them with \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to entertain successive petitions under some circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 449, 451 (emphasis added).  Not one of the cases on which the Court relies today supports the extraordinary premise that courts can create out of whole cloth an exception to a statutory bar to relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe opinion for the Court also trots out post-AEDPA cases to prove the irrelevant point that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he miscarriage of justice exception .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. survived AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  What it ignores, yet again, is that after AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, as before, the exception applied only to nonstatutory obstacles to relief.  Bousley v. United States and House v. Bell were applications of the judge-made doctrine of procedural default.  See Bousley, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614, \n623 (1998)\n; id., at 625 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s central holding\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0that none of its judge-made rules foreclose petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s collateral attack\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); id., at 630 (Scalia, J., dissenting); House, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 522.

Its explanation for this lack of precedent is that before AEDPA, \xe2\x80\x9cpetitions for federal habeas relief were not governed by any statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That is true but utterly unprobative.  There are many statutory bars to relief other than statutes of limitations, and we had never (and before today, have never) created an actual-innocence exception to any of them.  The reason why is obvious: Judicially amending a validly enacted statute in this way is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has no qualms about transgressing such a basic principle.  It does not even attempt to cloak its act of judicial legislation in the pretense that it is merely construing the statute; indeed, it freely admits that its opinion recognizes an \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute does not contain.  Ante, at 7.  And it dismisses, with a series of transparent non sequiturs, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming textual argument that the statute provides no such exception and envisions none.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe key textual point is that two provisions of \xc2\xa72244, working in tandem, provide a comprehensive path to relief for an innocent prisoner who has newly discovered evidence that supports his constitutional claim.  Section 2244(d)(1)(D) gives him a fresh year in which to file, starting on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) lifts the bar on second or successive petitions.  Congress clearly anticipated the scenario of a habeas petitioner with a credible innocence claim and addressed it by crafting an exception (and an exception, by the way, more restrictive than the one that pleases the Court today).  One cannot assume that Congress left room for other, judge-made applications of the actual-innocence exception, any more than one would add another gear to a Swiss watch on the theory that the watchmaker surely would have included it if he had thought of it.  In both cases, the intricate craftsmanship tells us that the designer arranged things just as he wanted them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s feeble rejoinder is that its (judicially in- vented) version of the \xe2\x80\x9cactual innocence\xe2\x80\x9d exception applies only to a \xe2\x80\x9cseverely confined category\xe2\x80\x9d of cases.  Ante, at 10.  Since cases qualifying for the actual-innocence exception will be rare, it explains, the statutory path for innocent petitioners will not \xe2\x80\x9cbe rendered superfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That is no answer at all.  That the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exception would not entirely frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99s design does not weaken the force of the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Congress addressed the issue comprehensively and chose to exclude dilatory prisoners like respondent.  By the Court\xe2\x80\x99s logic, a statute banning littering could simply be deemed to contain an exception for cigarette butts; after all, the statute as thus amended would still cover something.  That is not how a court respectful of the separation of powers should interpret statutes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven more bizarre is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern that applying AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations without recognizing an atextual actual-innocence exception would \xe2\x80\x9caccord greater force to a federal deadline than to a similarly designed state deadline.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9; see also ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa02.  The Court terms that outcome \xe2\x80\x9cpassing strange,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9, but it is not strange at all.  Only federal statutes of limitations bind federal habeas courts with the force of law; a state statute of limitations is given effect on federal habeas review only by virtue of the judge-made doctrine of procedural default.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 730\xe2\x80\x93731.  With its eye firmly fixed on something it likes\xe2\x80\x94a shiny new exception to a statute unloved in the best circles\xe2\x80\x94the Court overlooks this basic distinction, which would not trouble a second-year law student armed with a copy of Hart &amp; Wechsler.  The Court simply ignores basic legal principles where they pose an obstacle to its policy-driven, free-form improvisation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory-construction blooper reel does not end there.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s express inclusion of innocence-based exceptions in two neighboring provisions of the Act confirms, one would think, that there is no actual-innocence exception to \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  Section 2244(b)(2)(B), as already noted, lifts the bar on claims presented in second or successive petitions where \xe2\x80\x9cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. due diligence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts underlying the claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found\xe2\x80\x9d the petitioner guilty.  Section 2254(e)(2) permits a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing where a diligent state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim relies on new facts that \xe2\x80\x9cwould be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found\xe2\x80\x9d him guilty.  Ordinarily, we would draw from the express enumeration of these two actual-innocence exceptions the inference that no others were intended.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s twisting path to the contrary conclusion is not easy to follow, but I will try.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the key fact here is that these two provisions of AEDPA codified what had previously been judge-made barriers to relief and applied to them a stricter actual-innocence standard than the courts had been applying.  See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  From this, the Court reasons that Congress made a conscious choice not also to apply the more restrictive actual-innocence standard to the statute of limitations.  Ergo, the Court concludes, we are free to apply the more lenient version of the actual-innocence exception.  Ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  That clever account ignores the background against which Congress legislated.  Of course Congress did not \xe2\x80\x9cconstrain\xe2\x80\x9d application of the actual-innocence exception to the statute of limitations.  It felt no need to do so, because it had no reason whatsoever to suspect that any version of the exception would apply to the statute of limitations.  The collective efforts of respondent and the majority have turned up not a single instance where this Court has applied the actual-innocence exception to any statutory barrier to habeas relief, much less to a statute of limitations.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, supra.  What has been said of equitable tolling applies in spades to non-tolling judi- cial inventions: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress cannot intend to incorporate, by silence, various forms of equitable tolling that were not generally recognized in the common law at the time of enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bain &amp; Colella, Interpreting Federal Statutes of Limitations, 37 Creighton L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 493, 503 (2004). The only conceivable relevance of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) is (1) as we have said, that no other actual-innocence exception was intended, and (2) that if Congress had anticipated that this Court would amend \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) to add an actual-innocence exception (which it surely did not), it would have desired the more stringent formulation and not the expansive formulation applied today, which it specifically rejected for those other provisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThree years ago, in Holland v. Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010), we held that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling.  That holding offers no support for importing a novel actual-innocence exception.  Equit- able tolling\xe2\x80\x94extending the deadline for a filing because of an event or circumstance that deprives the filer, through no fault of his own, of the full period accorded by the statute\xe2\x80\x94seeks to vindicate what might be considered the genuine intent of the statute.  By contrast, suspending the statute because of a separate policy that the court believes should trump it (\xe2\x80\x9cactual innocence\xe2\x80\x9d) is a blatant over- ruling.  Moreover, the doctrine of equitable tolling is centuries old, and dates from a time when the separation of the legislative and judicial powers was incomplete.  See, e.g., Bree v. Holbech, 2 Doug. 655, 656 (1781) (Mansfield, J.); South-Sea Co. v. Wymondsell, 24 E. R. 1004, 3 P. Wms. 143, 144 (1732); Booth v. Warrington, 2 E. R. 111, 112\xe2\x80\x93113, 4 Bro.

As Professor Manning has explained, until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Crown retained \xe2\x80\x9cpretensions to independent legislative authority, and English judges continued to serve as the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s agents, in theory and practice a component of the executive.  Given these conditions, which distinguish the old English from the American constitutional context, it is not surprising to find a similarly indistinct line between appropriate legislative and judicial functions in matters of interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Manning, Textualism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (2001) (footnote omitted).  Thus, the doctrine of the equity of the statute, of which equitable tolling was an example, was reflected in Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-thirds of the way through the eighteenth century.\xe2\x80\x9d  Manning, supra, at 52.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAmerican courts\xe2\x80\x99 later adoption of the English equitable-tolling practice need not be regarded as a violation of the separation of powers, but can be seen as a reasonable assumption of genuine legislative intent.  Colonial legislatures would have assumed that equitable tolling would attend any statute of limitations they adopted.  In any case, equitable tolling surely represents such a reasonable assumption today.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.  Congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this background principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Young v. United States, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43\n\xe2\x80\x9350 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see Manning, What Divides Textualists from Purposivists? 106 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 70, 81\xe2\x80\x9382, and n. 42 (2006).  Congress, being well aware of the longstanding background presumption of equitable tolling, \xe2\x80\x9cmay provide otherwise if it wishes to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89, \n96 (1990)\n.  The majority and dissenting opinions in Holland disputed whether that presumption had been overcome, but all agreed that the presumption existed and was a legitimate tool for construing statutes of limitations.
