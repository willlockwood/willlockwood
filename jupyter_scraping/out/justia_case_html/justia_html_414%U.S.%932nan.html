In the First trial the prosecutor had waived the habitual offender provision for a mandatory life sentence in exchange for the petitioner\'s agreement to waive his right to jury trial. On retrial, petitioner exercised his right to jury trial and the prosecutor refused to waive the habitual offender sentence enhancement provisions. As a consequence petitioner received a mandatory life sentence upon conviction. The prosecutor has stipulated that: </p><ul>\'The decision made by the District Attorney of Travis County to waive the \'habitual count\' of the indictment in [the first trial] was based solely upon the fact that the Defendant waived a jury trial.

Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/17/case.html">412 U.S. 17</a>, 32 n. 20; Shapiro v.

A guilty plea constitutes a waiver of several fundamental rights, among them the right to jury trial. See Santobello v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/257/case.html#264">404 U.S. 257, 264</a> ( Douglas, J., concurring). Plea bargaining, the extreme importance of which was recognized in Santobello, leaves with the prosecutor the power to set the price for the exercise of those rights. Machibroda v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/487/case.html">368 U.S. 487</a>, held a guilty plea voidable if induced by the prosecutor\'s threat to bring additional prosecutions. Yet plea bargaining would be eliminated if an accepted plea to a lesser offense was rendered constitutionally vulnerable by the prosecutor\'s expressed intent to otherwise proceed to trial on the crime charged. <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="934">[414 U.S. 932 , 934]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1950601">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> CORPUS v.

Rev. 439 (1971), and Note, The Unconstitutionality of Plea Bargaining, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1387 (1970)), this Court has never spelled out the constitutional limits on the practice. This case, in which the accused\'s right to jury trial was expressly burdened with the possiblity of a mandatory life sentence (possibly the maximum penalty a State may exact for criminal conduct; see Furman v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/case.html">408 U.S. 238</a>) under the habitual offender provisions, provides an opportunity to delimit its permissible bounds.
