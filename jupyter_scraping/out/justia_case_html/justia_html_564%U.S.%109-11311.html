S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), petitioner Sykes had prior convictions for at least three felonies, including the state-law crime of \xe2\x80\x9cus[ing] a vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly or intentionally\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfle[e] from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d after being ordered to stop, Ind.

The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions subjected Sykes to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e), provides for an armed defendant who has three prior \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d convictions.  Rejecting Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 argument that his vehicle flight felony was not \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, is a violent felony for purposes of ACCA.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)], without inquiring into the specific conduct of th[e] particular offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a>, 202 (emphasis deleted).  When punishable by more than one year in prison, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes that involve use of explosives are violet felonies.  Under the residual clause in question so too is a crime that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), <em>i.e.,</em> a risk \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable to that posed by its closest analog among\xe2\x80\x9d the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated offenses.  <em>Id.</em>, at 203.  When a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of the offense.  Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  His indifference to these collateral consequences has violent\xe2\x80\x94even lethal\xe2\x80\x94potential for others.  A fleeing criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  Also telling is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.  In fact, the risks associated with vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.  While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of personal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes than for vehicle pursuits.  Thus, Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on vehicle flight falls within \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

S. 137</a>, and <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a>, require ACCA predicate crimes to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not\xe2\x80\x94overreads those opinions.  In general, levels of risk divide crimes that qualify as violent felonies from those that do not.  <em>Chambers</em> is no exception: It explained that failure to report does not qualify because the typical offender is not \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender.\xe2\x80\x9d  555 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  <em>Begay,</em> which held that driving under the influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate and stated that it is not purposeful, violent, and aggressive, 553 U. S., at 145\xe2\x80\x93148, is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sole residual clause decision in which risk was not the dispositive factor.  But <em>Begay</em> also gave a more specific reason for its holding: DUI \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be purposeful or deliberate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 145, and is analogous to strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.  <em>Begay</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d phrase is an addition to the statutory text that has no precise link to the residual clause.  Because vehicle flight is not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and is, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in the residual clause, it is a violent felony.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Sykes contends that the fact that Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(B) criminalizes flight by an offender who \xe2\x80\x9coperates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that Indiana did not intend for \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(A), under which he was convicted, to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights reached by subsection (b)(1)(B).  This argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats the two subsections as felonies of the same magnitude carrying similar prison terms, suggesting that subsection (b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) violation.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  The residual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that presented by several enumerated offenses.  It instructs potential recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again transgress.  This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a person to conform his conduct to the law.  While this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact.

The instant case is another in a series in which the Court is called upon to interpret \xc2\xa7924(e) to determine if a particular previous conviction was for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in the punishment enhancement statute.  See <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html"></a><a href="/us/550/192/index.html">550 U.

Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933 (2004).  The relevant text of the statute is set out\nin the discussion below.  For the reasons explained, the vehicle flight that the statute proscribes is a violent felony as the federal statute uses that term.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Marcus Sykes pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), in connection with an attempted robbery of two people at gunpoint.  Sykes had previous convictions for at least three felonies.

Sykes was convicted for vehicle flight, in violation of Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresisting law enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d law.  Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933.

The Court of Appeals of Indiana has interpreted the crime of vehicle flight to require \xe2\x80\x9ca knowing attempt to escape law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodward</em> v. <em>State</em>, 770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 897, 901 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  <em>Woodward </em>involved a driver who repeatedly flashed his bright lights and failed to obey traffic signals.  <em>Id.</em>, at 898.  When an officer activated his emergency equipment, the defendant became \xe2\x80\x9caware \xe2\x80\xa6 that [the officer] wanted him to pull his vehicle over,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead drove for a mile without \xe2\x80\x9cstopping, slowing, or otherwise acknowledging\xe2\x80\x9d the officer because, he later testified, he \xe2\x80\x9cwas \xe2\x80\x98trying to rationalize why [he] would be pulled over.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 898, 901.  Though the defendant later claimed that he was also seeking a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-lighted place to stop where there would be someone who knew him,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,\nat 901,<em> </em>his actions suggested otherwise. He passed two\ngas stations, a food outlet store, and a McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s be-\nfore pulling over.  When he got out of the car, he began to shout profanities at the pursuing officer.  <em>Ibid.  </em>By that time, the officer had called for backup and exited his own vehicle with his gun drawn.  <em>Id.</em>, at 898.  In answering the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the sufficiency of the above evidence, the Indiana court held that because he knew that a police officer sought to stop him, the defendant could not \xe2\x80\x9cchoose the location of the stop\xe2\x80\x9d and insist on completing the stop \xe2\x80\x9con his own terms,\xe2\x80\x9d as he had done, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout adequate justification,\xe2\x80\x9d which he lacked.  <em>Id.</em>, at 901\xe2\x80\x93902.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 federal sentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.  After observing Sykes driving without using needed headlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a traffic stop.  Sykes did not stop.  A chase ensued.  Sykes wove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road and through yards containing bystanders, passed through a fence, and struck the rear of a house.  Then he fled on foot.  He was found only with the aid of a police dog.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court decided that his three prior convictions, including the one for violating the prohibition on vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of \xc2\xa7924(e) and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment.  On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F.\xc2\xa03d 334 (2010).  The court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Appeals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits.  <em>Powell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 490 (CA1 2005) <em>(per curiam); United States</em> v. <em>Harrimon</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 531, 534\xe2\x80\x93537 (CA5 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>LaCasse</em>, 567 F.\xc2\xa03d 763, 765\xe2\x80\x93767 (CA6 2009);<em> United States</em> v. <em>McConnell</em>, 605 F. 3d 822, 827\xe2\x80\x93830 (CA10 2010) (finding the flight to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d under the \xe2\x80\x9cnearly identical\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines).<em> </em>It was in conflict with a ruling by a Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa03d 1280, 1291\xe2\x80\x931296 (2009), and at least in tension, if not in conflict, with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Tyler</em>, 580 F.\xc2\xa03d 722, 724\xe2\x80\x93726 (2009), and for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kelly</em>, 422 F.\xc2\xa03d 889, 892\xe2\x80\x93897 (2005), <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jennings</em>, 515 F.\xc2\xa03d 980, 992\xe2\x80\x93993 (2008), and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Peterson</em>, No. 07\xe2\x80\x9330465, 2009 WL 3437834, *1 (Oct. 27, 2009).  The writ of certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), allows this Court to address the conflict.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether an offense is a violent felony, this Court has explained,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwe employ the categorical approach \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Under this approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.  That is, we consider whether the <em>elements of the offense</em> are of the type that would\njustify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 202 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 599\xe2\x80\x93602 (1990).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSo while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 own case were violent, the question is whether \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), an offense is deemed a violent felony if it is a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment that</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nResisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).  Thus, it is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within the so-called residual provision of clause (ii).  To be a vio-lent crime, it must be an offense that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise in-\nvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question, then, is whether Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on flight from an officer by driving a vehicle\xe2\x80\x94the violation of Indiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier conviction\xe2\x80\x94falls within the residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  The offenses enumerated in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x94burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when \xe2\x80\x9cthe risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 203 (explaining that attempted burglary poses risks akin to that of completed burglary).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent\xe2\x80\x94even lethal\xe2\x80\x94potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of burglary.  Burglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon\xe2\x80\x99s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Gant</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because an accepted way to restrain a driver who poses dangers to others is through seizure, officers pursuing fleeing drivers may deem themselves duty bound to escalate their response to ensure the felon is apprehended.  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 385 (2007), rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator \xe2\x80\x9cmight have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.\xe2\x80\x9d  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a\nlaw enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See <em>post, </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (listing Indiana cases addressing ordinary intentional vehicle flight and noting the high-risk conduct that those convictions involved).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although statistics are not dispositive, here they confirm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s vehicular flight crime is a violent felony.  See <em>Chambers</em>, 555 U. S., at 129 (explaining that statistical evidence sometimes \xe2\x80\x9chelps provide a conclusive \xe2\x80\xa6 answer\xe2\x80\x9d concerning the risks that crimes present).  As Justice Thomas explains, chase-related crashes kill more than 100 nonsuspects every year.  See <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Injury rates are much higher.  Studies show that between 18% and 41% of chases involve crashes, which always carry a risk of injury, and that between 4% and 17% of all chases end in injury.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A 2008 International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) study examined 7,737 police pursuits reported by 56 agencies in 30 States during 2001\xe2\x80\x932007.  C. Lum &amp; G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and Reform 54.  Those pursuits, the study found, resulted in 313 injuries to police and bystanders, a rate of slightly over 4 injuries to these nonsuspects per 100 pursuits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 57.  Given that police may be least likely to pursue suspects where the dangers to bystanders are greatest\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> when flights occur at extraordinarily high speeds\xe2\x80\x94\nit is possible that risks associated with vehicle flight are even higher.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those risks may outstrip the dangers of at least two offenses enumerated in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  According to a study by the Department of Justice, approximately 3.7 million burglaries occurred on average each year in the United States between 2003 and 2007.  Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Catalano, Victimization during Household Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010).  Those burglaries resulted in an annual average of approximately 118,000 injuries, or 3.2 injuries for every 100 burglaries.  <em>Id., </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  That risk level is 20% lower than that which the IACP found for vehicle pursuits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U. S. Fire Administration (USFA) maintains the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest data bank on fires.  It secures participation from over one-third of U. S. fire departments.  It reports an estimated 38,400 arsons in 2008.  Those fires resulted in an estimated 1,255 injuries, or 3.3 injuries per 100 arsons.

That risk level is about 20% lower than that reported by the IACP for vehicle flight.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehicle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the Armed Career Criminal Act\xe2\x80\x99s (ACCA) residual clause demands.  In his view this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Begay</em> and <em>Chambers</em> require ACCA predicates to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.  Sykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes \xe2\x80\x9ctypically committed by those whom one normally labels \xe2\x80\x98armed career criminals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that is, crimes that \xe2\x80\x9cshow an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Begay</em>,<em> </em>553 U. S.,<em> </em>at 146.  In general, levels of risk divide crimes that qualify from those that do not.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>James</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html"></a><a href="/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a> (finding attempted burglary risky enough to qualify).  <em>Chambers</em> is no exception.  555 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936) (explaining that failure to report does not qualify because the typical offender is not \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause in which risk was not the dis-positive factor is <em>Begay</em>, which held that driving under\nthe influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate.  There, the Court stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and aggressive.  553 U. S., at 145\xe2\x80\x93148.  But the Court also gave a more specific reason for its holding.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 145 (analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes).  By contrast,<em> </em>the Indiana statute at issue here has a stringent <em>mens rea</em> requirement.  Violators must act \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly or intentionally.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(a); see <em>Woodward</em>, 770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 901 (construing the statute to require \xe2\x80\x9ca knowing attempt to escape law enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d has no precise textual link to the residual clause, which requires that an ACCA predicate \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The <em>Begay </em>phrase is an addition to the statutory text.  In many cases the purposeful, violent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the inquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former formulation and those that present serious potential risks of physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.  As between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a categorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve the case before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Begay </em>involved a crime akin to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, violent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to explain the result.  The felony at issue here is not a strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it is, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in which the offender \xe2\x80\x9coperates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(B).  In structuring its laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude.  They are both class D felonies, and both carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9350\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x937(a).  The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of \xe2\x80\xa6 process \xe2\x80\xa6 ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)\xe2\x80\x94flight\xe2\x80\x94which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, the \xe2\x80\x9csimilarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 10 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also <em>ibid.</em>, n. 2.  By adding subsection (b)(1)(A) in 1998, the Indiana Legislature determined that subsection (b)(1)(A) by itself sufficed as a basis for the punishments available under subsection (b)(1)(B).  <em>Post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311; see also <em>post,</em> at 10, n.\xc2\xa02 (identifying reckless endangerment statutes with similar structures); cf. <em>post</em>, at 12 (explaining that because in most cases Indiana does not \xe2\x80\x9cspecify what additional punishment is warranted when [a] crime kills or injures,\xe2\x80\x9d its provisions creating higher penalties for vehicle flights that do so reflect a judgment that these flights are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently risky\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.  As the above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand does not present the occasion to decide that question.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  It could have defined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered offenses.  Under the principle that all are deemed to know the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase\nhis sentence.  Given that ACCA \xe2\x80\x9crequires judges to make sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by different offenses,\xe2\x80\x9d this approach could simplify adjudications for judges in some cases.  <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 210, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress instead stated a normative principle.  The re-sidual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlaw-\nful possession of the firearm when the relevant prior offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives.  The provision instructs potential recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again transgress.  It states an intelligible principle and provides guidance that allows a person to \xe2\x80\x9cconform his or her conduct to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/41/index.html">527 U.

The majority also correctly refuses to apply the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0purposeful, violent, and aggressive\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d test created in <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/137/index.html">553 U.

Therefore I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly or intentionally \xe2\x80\xa6 flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop\xe2\x80\x9d commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(a)(3).  If the person \xe2\x80\x9cuses a vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA if it is \xe2\x80\x9cburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.

Statistics, common experience, and Indiana cases support this conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The specific crimes Congress listed as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon-[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d in ACCA\xe2\x80\x94arson, extortion, burglary, and use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94provide a \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline against which to measure the degree of risk\xe2\x80\x9d that a nonenumerated offense must present in order to qualify as a violent felony.  <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a>, 208 (2007); see also <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.  Its elements are \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 599 (1990).  As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary is in \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress\xe2\x80\x9d and the danger inherent in such a \xe2\x80\x9cface-to-face confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 203.  The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See <em>id.</em>, at 195.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, <em>every</em> \xc2\xa73(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  <em>Every </em>\xc2\xa73(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance<em> </em>of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s direct order to stop, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is a clear challenge to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s authority and typically initiates pursuit.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harrimon</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Spells</em>, 537 F.\xc2\xa03d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cTaking flight calls the officer to give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to pedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the officer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit\xe2\x80\x9d).  Finally, in <em>every</em> \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator<em> </em>is armed with what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle.

S. 372</a>, 383 (2007) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9ceven remotely comparable to the extreme danger to human life\xe2\x80\x9d posed by that vehicular chase); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he dangerous circumstances surrounding a person\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to flee from law enforcement are compounded by the\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s operation of a motor vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aceves-Rosales</em>, 832 F.\xc2\xa02d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indisputable that an automobile \xe2\x80\xa6 can be used as a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, every violation of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles \xe2\x80\x9carmed burglary in the presence of a security guard\xe2\x80\x9d more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk\xe2\x80\x94a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that\nconfrontation\xe2\x80\x94than burglary.  It follows that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,\xe2\x80\x9d poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.  <em>James</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 208.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk\xe2\x80\x9d of intentional vehicular flight.  Cf. <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a>, 129 (2009) (statistical evidence, though not always necessary, \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly supports the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a serious potential risk of physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d).  Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.  National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis, Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving Police in Pursuit 37\xe2\x80\x9356 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such deaths between 2000 and 2009).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The number injured must be much higher.  Many thousands of police chases occur every year.  In California and Pennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police were involved in a combined total of more than 8,700 chases in 2007 alone.  See Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research &amp; Development, Police Pursuits 2007 Annual Report; Report to the Legislature, Senate Bill 719, California Police Pursuits (March 2008); see also Schultz, Hudak, &amp; Alpert, Emergency Driving and Pursuits, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, Apr. 2009, pp.\xc2\xa01, 4 (surveying more than 2,100 police officers and finding an average of just over one pursuit per officer each year).  And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.  Wells &amp; Falcone, Research on Police Pursuits: Advantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies, 20 Policing: Int\xe2\x80\x99l J. Police Strategies &amp; Management 729, 740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate between 18% and 41%).  Indeed, studies show that 4% to 17% of all chases actually cause injury.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also C. Lum &amp; G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and Reform 57 (2008) (finding that 23.5% of flights involve a crash, and 9% of flights cause injury).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An International Association of Chiefs of Police study\nof 7,737 pursuits across 30 States found 900 injuries, of which 313 were to police or bystanders.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As the majority observes, that injury rate is just over 4 injuries per 100 chases, <em>excluding</em> injuries to the perpetrator.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  By comparison, the injury rate for burglary and arson is around 3 injuries per 100 crimes, or less.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9; see also <em>Harrimon</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 537 (citing similar arson statistics, showing between 1 and 3 injuries per 100 fires, apparently including injuries to perpetrators).  Statistics support what logic suggests: The ordinary case of intentional vehicular flight is risky, indeed, more so than some offenses listed in ACCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statistical risks of intentional flight merely reinforce common sense and real world experience.

Although these cases are only a limited collection, their facts illustrate that convictions under \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) often involve highly dangerous conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(1)(B), which includes \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d as an additional element, indicates that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes observes that it would violate the statute to flee at low speed, obeying traffic signs and stopping after only a short distance.  See <em>Woodward</em> v. <em>State</em>, 770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 897, 900\xe2\x80\x93901 (Ind. App. 2002); <em>post</em>, at 4 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  Such a flight, he urges, would not present \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d so\na conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a violent felony.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to violate \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional vehicular flight is dangerous \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 208.  It is also possible to imagine committing burglary\xe2\x80\x94an enumerated offense\xe2\x80\x94under circumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical injury.  See <em>id.</em>, at 207 (hypothesizing a \xe2\x80\x9cbreak-in of an unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and away from any potential intervenors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See <em>Swain</em> v. <em>State</em>, 923 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 32, 2010 WL 623720 (Ind. App., Feb. 23, 2010); <em>Woodward</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 898.  Yet not even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct.  In <em>Swain</em>, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Hurry up.  Come on.  They\xe2\x80\x99re coming,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and drove off as the runner jumped in.  <em>Id.</em>, at *1.  She stopped 10 to 15 seconds later, when police vehicles converging on the scene took up pursuit.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Woodward</em>, the defendant ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed several good places to pull over, and drove all the way home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and obeyed traffic laws.  770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 898.  Eventually the defendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the officer, who drew his pistol.  <em>Id.,</em> at 898, 901; see also <em>id.</em>, at 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to stop \xe2\x80\x9cexcept on his own terms\xe2\x80\x9d and noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe dangers that could await a police officer stopping where the citizen selects\xe2\x80\x9d).  These two cases fall well short of showing\nthat intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See also <em>post</em>, at 6 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (noting that\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cintuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures to stop \xe2\x80\xa6 seems consistent with common sense and\nexperience\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, \xc2\xa73(b)\n(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while \xe2\x80\x9coper-at[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substan-\ntial risk of bodily injury to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) has no such element.  From this, Sykes infers that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) casts \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  But the fact that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) includes \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk of bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d\nas an element does not restrict \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky\nconduct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, apart from the existence of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version\nof \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, \xc2\xa73(a)(1); interfering with service of process, \xc2\xa73(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, \xc2\xa73(a)(3).  Under \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person\xe2\x80\x9d has long been a class D felony.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) to provide that <em>any </em>use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under \xc2\xa73(a)(3) is <em>always</em> a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It is still the case that under \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is \xe2\x80\x9coperate[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This rough equivalence between \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) and \xc2\xa73(b)\n(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law.  The conduct\nunderlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, demonstrates that despite \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B), convictions under \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the remainder of Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner that causes serious bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(2).  The same act becomes a class B felony if someone is killed.  \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(b)(3).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Justice Kagan asserts that each of these \xe2\x80\x9cseparate, escalating crimes\xe2\x80\x9d captures an increasing degree of risk and necessarily means that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A), the offense <em>simpliciter</em>, is less risky than it otherwise seems.<em>  Post</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaw in this reasoning is that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(b)(2) and (3) enhance punishment based solely on the <em>results </em>of the flight<em>, </em>not the degree of risk it posed.  Neither provision requires any action by a suspect beyond that which satisfies the elements of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent<em> </em>in a violation of \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.  The risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicular flight <em>simpliciter</em> was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9343\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x937.2; \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9343\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x937.  In sum, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) is less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support the idea that it is inherently risky.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s crime of intentional vehicular flight, \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A), \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The crime is therefore a violent felony under ACCA.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indiana law at the time of Sykes\xe2\x80\x99 conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is \xe2\x80\x9creckless endangering in the second degree\xe2\x80\x9d either to \xe2\x80\x9crecklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,\xe2\x80\x9d Haw.\xc2\xa0Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7707\xe2\x80\x93714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), <em>or </em>to \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7707\xe2\x80\x93714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough <em>per se</em> that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\xe2\x80\x93A, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly here, I infer that \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense <em>inherently </em>qualifies as, or approximates, \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) when it added \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A).  <em>Post</em>, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange<font b="1"> for the legislature to have left the reference to \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bruesewitz</em> v. <em>Wyeth LLC</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).

More specifically, it is an at-tempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what distinguishes \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felonies\xe2\x80\x9d under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes.  See <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a> (2007); <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/137/index.html">553 U. S. 137</a> (2008); <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a> (2009).  We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in about every second or third volume of the United States Reports.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion produces a fourth ad\xc2\xa0hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\xc2\xa0 Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/352/index.html">461 U. S. 352</a>, 357 (1983).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ACCA defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d in relevant part, as \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year \xe2\x80\xa6 that \xe2\x80\xa6 is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See \xc2\xa7924(e)(1); see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa03d 1280, 1282, n.\xc2\xa01 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause; that is, if it \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree\nof risk \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in the first of our\nresidual-clause trilogy, <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See <em>id.</em>, at 230 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the <em>James</em> standard to the pres-\nent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to <em>any</em> of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Daye</em>, 571 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 228\xe2\x80\x93236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Upton</em>, 512 F.\xc2\xa03d 394, 403\xe2\x80\x93405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see <em>Chambers,</em> <em>supra</em>.  I predicted this inadequacy of the \xe2\x80\x9cclosest analog\xe2\x80\x9d test in my <em>James </em>dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But as it turns out, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion introduces the <em>James </em>standard with the words \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or instance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely <em>one example</em> of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) \xe2\x80\x9cprovide guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in <em>James</em>\xe2\x80\x94finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this \xe2\x80\x9cseries\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test of <em>Begay?</em>  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today\xe2\x80\x99s tutti-frutti opinion.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn many cases,\xe2\x80\x9d we are told, it \xe2\x80\x9cwill be redundant with the inquiry into risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  That seems to be the case here\xe2\x80\x94though why, and when it will <em>not </em>be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s accusation that Sykes \xe2\x80\x9coverreads the opinions of this Court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of <em>Begay</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test, which the Court now suggests applies only \xe2\x80\x9cto strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ante</em>, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful\xe2\x80\x9d test, since the last two adjectives (\xe2\x80\x9cviolent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed <em>Begay</em> \xe2\x80\x9coverrea[d]\xe2\x80\x9d it just as Sykes does<footcall num="*">\xe2\x80\x94and as does the Government, see Brief for United States 8.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only case that is not brought forward in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, <em>Chambers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a>\xe2\x80\x94which applied both the risky-as-the-least-risky test and the \xe2\x80\x9cpur-poseful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test to reach the con-clusion that failure to report for periodic incarceration\nwas not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does cite <em>Chambers </em>for another point: Whereas <em>James </em>rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no \xe2\x80\x9chard statistics\xe2\x80\x9d on risk-iness \xe2\x80\x9chave been called to our attention,\xe2\x80\x9d 550 U. S., at\n210; and whereas <em>Begay </em>made no mention of statistics; <em>Chambers </em>explained (as today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion points out) that \xe2\x80\x9cstatistical evidence sometimes \xe2\x80\x98helps provide a conclusive \xe2\x80\xa6 answer\xe2\x80\x99 concerning the risks that crimes present,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8 (quoting <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 129).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion then outdoes <em>Chambers </em>in the volume of statistics that it spews forth\xe2\x80\x94statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, <em>ante</em>, at 8; statistics from the Department of Justice concerning injuries attributable to burglaries, <em>ante</em>, at 9; statistics from the U. S. Fire Administration concerning injuries attributable to fires, <em>ibid.</em>, and (by reference to Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence) statistics from the National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis, the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research, the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and several articles published elsewhere concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, <em>ante</em>, at 8 (citing <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702\xe2\x80\x93703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies\xe2\x80\x99 findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See <em>post</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa04 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See <em>ante</em>, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1\xe2\x80\x932 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http:\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0www.usfa.dhs.gov\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0downloads\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0pdf\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0tfrs\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government\xe2\x80\x99s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also <em>Chambers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the more fundamental problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness\nof the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured <em>ex ante</em>\xe2\x80\x94<em>before </em>the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not <em>after.  </em>Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When I dissented from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>James</em>, I said that the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshoddy draftsmanship\xe2\x80\x9d put courts to a difficult choice:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThey can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, \xe2\x80\xa6 ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a \xe2\x80\x98serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x99 (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d 550 U. S., at 229\xe2\x80\x93230.</p>\n<p align="left">\nMy dissent \xe2\x80\x9ctried to implement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 230,<em> </em>the third option; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.  \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cpermits an unintelligible crim-inal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unexplained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 230\xe2\x80\x93231.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My assessment has not been changed by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s later decisions in the ACCA \xe2\x80\x9cseries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, which adds to the \xe2\x80\x9cclosest analog\xe2\x80\x9d test <em>(James)</em> the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test <em>(Begay)</em>, and even the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I had proposed as the exclusive criterion, has not made the statute\xe2\x80\x99s applica-\ntion clear and predictable.  And all of them together\xe2\x80\x94or even the risky-as-the-least-risky test alone, I am now convinced\xe2\x80\x94never will.  The residual-clause series will be endless, and we will be doing ad\xc2\xa0hoc application of ACCA to the vast variety of state criminal offenses until the cows come home.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not \xe2\x80\x9cgive a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice\xe2\x80\x9d of its reach, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Batchelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/index.html">442 U. S. 114</a>, 123 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbitrary enforcement, see <em>Kolender</em>, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past\xe2\x80\x94indeed, in the recent past.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Skilling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 561 U. S. ___ (2010).  That is regrettable, see <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes\xe2\x80\x94and what confirms its incurable vagueness\xe2\x80\x94is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield \xe2\x80\x9can intelligible principle,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/255/81/index.html">255 U. S. 81</a>, 89\xe2\x80\x9390 (1921).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,\nthis is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9cNone of the provisions the Court cites \xe2\x80\xa6 is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word \xe2\x80\x98otherwise,\xe2\x80\x99 preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase \xe2\x80\x98shades of red,\xe2\x80\x99 standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase \xe2\x80\x98fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, <em>navy blue, </em>or colors that otherwise involve shades of red\xe2\x80\x99 assuredly does so.\xe2\x80\x9d    <em>James</em>,<em> </em>550 U. S., at 230, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p align="left">\nOf course even if the cited statutes were comparable, repetition of constitutional error does not produce constitutional truth.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I think it would be highly responsible\xe2\x80\x94to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Holloway</em>, 630 F.\xc2\xa03d 252, 260 (CA1 2011); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 629 F.\xc2\xa03d 290, 295\xe2\x80\x93296 (CA2 2011) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, 612 F.\xc2\xa03d 170, 196 (CA3 2010); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, 631 F.\xc2\xa03d 680, 683 (CA4 2011); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harrimon</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 531, 534 (CA5 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Young</em>, 580 F.\xc2\xa03d 373, 377 (CA6 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sonnenberg</em>, 628 F.\xc2\xa03d 361, 364 (CA7 2010); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Boyce</em>, 633 F.\xc2\xa03d 708, 711 (CA8 2011); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Terrell</em>, 593 F.\xc2\xa03d 1084, 1089\xe2\x80\x931091 (CA9 2010); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ford</em>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d 1263, 1272\xe2\x80\x931273 (CA10 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrison</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa03d 1280, 1295\xe2\x80\x931296 (CA11 2009).</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963579">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKAGAN, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSYKES V.

A person may attempt to outrun police officers by driving recklessly and at high speed, in disregard of traffic laws and with disdain for others\xe2\x80\x99 safety.  Or a person may fail to heed an officer\xe2\x80\x99s command to pull over, but otherwise drive in a lawful manner, perhaps just trying to find a better place to stop.  In Indiana, as in most States, both of these individuals are lawbreakers.  But in Indiana, again as in most States, the law takes account of the differences between them, by distinguishing simple from aggravated forms of vehicular flight.  Unlike the Court, I would attend to these distinctions when deciding which of Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s several vehicular flight crimes count as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).  Because petitioner Marcus Sykes was convicted only of simple vehicular flight, and not of any flight offense involving aggressive or dangerous activity, I would find that he did not commit a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court relates, we must decide whether the crime of which Sykes was convicted falls within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.<em> </em>To do so, the crime must \xe2\x80\x9cpresen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and involve conduct that is \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/137/index.html">553 U. S. 137</a>, 145 (2008).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Because we use the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d we do not concern ourselves with Sykes\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct.  See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 602 (1990).<em> </em>Nor do we proceed by exploring whether some platonic form of an offense\xe2\x80\x94here, some abstract notion of vehicular flight\xe2\x80\x94satisfies ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  We instead focus on the elements of the actual state statute at issue.  Cf. <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a>, 126\xe2\x80\x93127 (2009) (breaking down an Illinois statute into discrete offenses to decide whether the crime of conviction fit within the residual clause); <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a>, 202 (2007) (examining how Florida\xe2\x80\x99s law defined attempted burglary to determine if the residual clause included that offense).  More particularly, we ask whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct encompassed by the elements\xe2\x80\x9d of that statute, \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d (not in every conceivable case), involves the requisite danger and violence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 208.  By making this inquiry, we attempt to determine whether the crime involved is \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic of the armed career criminal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise said, whether the prohibited conduct is of a kind that \xe2\x80\x9cmakes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Begay</em>, 553 U. S., at 145 (in-ternal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this approach, some vehicular flight offenses should count as violent felonies under ACCA.  Consider, for example, a statute that makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully flee from a law enforcement officer by driving at high speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a statute, by its terms, encompasses conduct that ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  And the covered conduct qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 145.  When a motorist responds to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s signal to stop by increasing his speed or taking reckless evasive action, he turns his car into a weapon and provokes confrontation.  In so doing, he engages in behavior \xe2\x80\x9croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\xe2\x80\x9d to that involved in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated offenses\xe2\x80\x94the sort of conduct, in other words, \xe2\x80\x9ctypically committed by . . . \xe2\x80\x98armed career criminals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 143, 146.  Like the majority, see <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, I therefore would classify crimes of this type\xe2\x80\x94call them aggravated vehicular flight offenses\xe2\x80\x94as violent felonies under ACCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But a vehicular flight offense need not target aggressive and dangerous behavior.  Imagine the converse of the statute described above\xe2\x80\x94a statute making it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully flee from a law enforcement officer <em>without </em>driving at high speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  That hypothetical statute addresses only simple vehicular flight: mere dis-regard of a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s directive to stop, devoid of additional conduct creating risk to others.  This behavior\xe2\x80\x94often called \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to stop\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is illegal in most States (under a wide variety of statutory provisions).  In Indiana, for example, a driver who \xe2\x80\x9cknow[s] that a police officer wishes to effectuate a traffic stop\xe2\x80\x9d may commit a felony if he attempts to \xe2\x80\x9cchoose the location of the stop,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than pulling over immediately; it makes no difference that the driver \xe2\x80\x9cdid not speed or disobey any \xe2\x80\xa6 traffic laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>State, </em>770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 897, 902 (Ind. App. 2002).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But a mere failure to stop does not usually \xe2\x80\x9cpresen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), any more than normal driving does.  Nor is this conduct \xe2\x80\x9cviolent \xe2\x80\xa6 and aggressive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Begay</em>, 553 U. S., at 145; see Brief for United States 43 (characterizing as \xe2\x80\x9cnonviolent\xe2\x80\x9d a flight from police that complies with \xe2\x80\x9call traffic laws\xe2\x80\x9d).  True, the offender is ignoring a command he should obey.  But nothing in his behavior is affirmatively belligerent: It does not \xe2\x80\x9cshow an increased likelihood that [he] is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Begay,</em> 553 U. S., at 146<em>.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</em>  And so, under our precedents, a statute criminalizing <em>only </em>simple vehicular flight would not fall within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  I do not understand the majority to disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Indiana provision under which Sykes was convicted straddles the two hypothetical statutes I have just described.  That provision, subsection (b)(1)(A), states that a person commits a felony if he \xe2\x80\x9cflees from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cus[ing] a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ind. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2009).  As the Indiana courts have recognized, the subsection thus criminalizes mere failure to stop, which should not count as a violent felony under ACCA.  See <em>Woodward, </em>770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 897; <em>supra</em>, at 4, and n. 2.  But the provision <em>also</em> includes<font b="1"> more violent forms of vehicular flight: It covers a person who speeds or drives recklessly, who leads the police on a \xe2\x80\x9cHollywood-style car chase,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 380 (2007), and who endangers police officers, other drivers, and pedestrians.  And so the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct encompassed by the elements\xe2\x80\x9d of\nthis subsection, <em>James, </em>550 U. S., at 208, runs the gamut\xe2\x80\x94from simple to aggravated vehicular flight, from the least violent to the most violent form of the activity.  Accord, <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (stating that subsection (b)(1)(A) is \xe2\x80\x9cnot restrict[ed] . . . to nonrisky conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  The question presented is whether such a facially broad provision meets the requirements of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If subsection (b)(1)(A) were the whole of Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s law on vehicular flight, the majority would have a reasonable argument that the provision does so.  As noted, a statute fits within the residual clause if it covers conduct that <em>in the ordinary case</em>\xe2\x80\x94not in every conceivable case\xe2\x80\x94poses serious risk of physical injury and is purposeful, violent, and aggressive.  See <em>James,</em> 550 U. S., at 208; <em>Begay</em>, 553 U. S., at 145.  We therefore must decide what the ordinary case of vehicular flight actually is<em>.  </em>Is it the person trying to escape from police by speeding or driving recklessly, in a way that endangers others?  Or is it instead the person driving normally who, for whatever reason, fails to respond immediately to a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s signal?  The Government has not presented any empirical evidence addressing this question, and such evidence may not in fact exist.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See Wells &amp; Falcone, Research on Police Pursuits: Advantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies, 20 Policing Int\xe2\x80\x99l J. Police Strategies &amp; Management 729 (1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cCollecting valid and reliable data on policing activities is a perennial problem \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  This is particularly true when studying \xe2\x80\xa6 vehicle pursuits\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Begay, </em>553 U. S., at 154 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cNeedless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures to stop\xe2\x80\x94that the aggravated form of the activity is also the ordinary form\xe2\x80\x94seems consistent with common sense and experience.  So that judgment, even though unsupported by data, would likely be sufficient to justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion were subsection (b)(1)(A) the only relevant provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But subsection (b)(1)(A) does not stand alone, and the context of the provision casts a different light on it.  Like a great many States (45 by my count), Indiana divides the world of vehicular flight into discrete categories, corresponding to the seriousness of the criminal behavior.  At the time of Sykes\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Indiana had four degrees\nof vehicular flight, only the first of which\xe2\x80\x94subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94covered mere failure to stop.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933.  Indiana classified as a felon any person who:</p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xe2\x80\x9cflees from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cus[ing] a vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73(b)(1)(A);</f></f></left></p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xe2\x80\x9cflees from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that <em>creates a substantial risk of bodily injury</em> to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>\xc2\xa73(b)(1)(B);[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</f></f></left></p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xe2\x80\x9cflees from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that <em>causes serious bodily injury</em> to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73(b)(2); or</f></f></left></p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xe2\x80\x9cflees from a law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9coperat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that <em>causes the death</em> of another person,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73(b)(3) (all emphasis added).</f></f></left></p>\n<p>\n\nVehicular flight in Indiana is therefore not a single offense, but instead a series of separate, escalating crimes.  Each category captures conduct more dangerous than the one before it, as shown by the language italicized above.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  And at the very beginning of this series is subsection (b)(1)(A), the offense of which Sykes was convicted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That placement alters the nature of the analysis.  We have previously examined the way statutory provisions relate to each other to determine whether a particular provision counts as a violent felony under ACCA.  In <em>Chambers</em>, 555 U. S., at 126\xe2\x80\x93127, we considered an Illinois statute prohibiting within a single section several different kinds of behavior, including escape from a penal institution and failure to report to a penal institution.  The courts below had treated the statute as defining a single crime of felonious escape and held that crime to qualify as a violent felony under ACCA.  See <em>id.,</em> at 125; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Chambers, </em>473 F.\xc2\xa03d 724, 725\xe2\x80\x93726 (CA7 2007).<font b="1">  We disagreed, stating that failure to report was a distinct offense, which did not meet ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  That was so, we stated, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he behavior that likely underlies a failure to report would seem less likely to involve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more aggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chambers, </em>555 U. S., at 127.<em> </em> In addition, we noted, the statute \xe2\x80\x9clist[ed] escape and failure to report separately\n(in its title and its body).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>We thus considered\nthe failure-to-report clause in its statutory context\xe2\x80\x94as\none part of a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s delineation of related criminal offenses\xe2\x80\x94to determine whether the behavior it encompassed ordinarily poses a serious risk of injury.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That same focus on statutory structure resolves this case, because it reveals subsection (b)(1)(A) to aim at a single form\xe2\x80\x94the least serious form\xe2\x80\x94of vehicular flight.  Remember: Indiana has made a purposeful choice to divide the full spectrum of vehicular flight into different degrees, based on the danger associated with a driver\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  Once again, starting with the most serious conduct: flight resulting in death; flight resulting in physical injury; flight creating a substantial risk of physical in-\njury; flight.  That last category\xe2\x80\x94flight\xe2\x80\x94almost screams to have the word \xe2\x80\x9cmere\xe2\x80\x9d placed before it.  Under the In-\ndiana statute, flight\xe2\x80\x94the conduct prohibited by subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94is what is left over when no aggravating factor causing substantial risk or harm exists.  Put on blinders, and the subsection is naturally<font b="1"> understood to address all<font b="1"> flight, up to and including the most dangerous kinds.  But take off those blinders\xe2\x80\x94view the statute as a whole\xe2\x80\x94and the subsection is instead seen to target failures to stop.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this vein, the distinction between subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) is especially telling.  As noted, subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits vehicular flight that \xe2\x80\x9ccreates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  That language almost precisely tracks the phrasing of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, which refers to conduct that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  This correspondence indicates that the conduct criminalized under subsection (b)(1)(B) qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA.  But subsection (b)(1)(A) lacks the very feature that makes subsection (b)(1)(B) and ACCA such a perfect match: It<font b="1"> does not require any behavior that poses serious risk to others.  This difference in statutory elements indicates that subsection (b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x94but <em>not</em> subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94is directed toward the conduct described in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  To count <em>both </em>as ACCA offenses is to pay insufficient heed to the way the Indiana Legislature drafted its statute\xe2\x80\x94as a series of escalating offenses, ranging from the simple to the most aggravated.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not deny that a State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to divide a generic form of conduct (like vehicular flight) into sep-arate, escalating crimes may make a difference under ACCA; rather, the Court declines to address that question.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  The Court rejects the structural argument here for one, and only one, reason.  Indiana, the major-\nity says, \xe2\x80\x9ctreats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude\xe2\x80\x9d: They are both class D felonies carrying the same punishment.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  See also <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  But the Court is wrong to think that fact dispositive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In general, \xe2\x80\x9csimilar punishment does not necessarily imply similar risk\xe2\x80\x9d (or similar violence).  <em>James,</em> 550 U. S., at 217 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Because this is so, the Court has never suggested that all state offenses falling within a single felony class and subject to the same penalties must receive the same treatment under ACCA.  To the contrary, we have always focused on the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 208 (majority opinion)\xe2\x80\x94an inquiry that does not mention the offense\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing consequences.  And that is for good reason.  It would be quite remarkable if either all or none of Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s (or any State\xe2\x80\x99s) class D felonies satisfied the requirements of the residual clause.  In Indiana, other such felonies, subject to \xe2\x80\x9cthe same magnitude\xe2\x80\x9d of punishment, <em>ante</em>, at 12, include election fraud, computer tampering, and \xe2\x80\x9ccemetery mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Ind. Code \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x931 <em>et seq. </em>(2009); \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9343\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x934; \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9343\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x932.1.<font b="1">  I presume the Court does not also intend to treat these offenses as violent felonies under ACCA.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, Indiana sentencing law has always enabled judges to take account of the difference between subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) in imposing punishment.  As the majority notes, <em>ante, </em>at 12, Indiana provides for a range of prison terms for class D felonies, stretching\nfrom six months to three years.  And in deciding what term to impose (or whether to suspend the term), courts may consider an array of aggravating factors\xe2\x80\x94including whether the crime \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened serious harm to per-\nsons,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9338\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x937.1(b)(1).  Convictions under subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) therefore may produce widely varying sentences, as judges respond to the different forms\n of vehicular flight targeted by the offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court argues, in support of its position, that the \xe2\x80\x9csimilarity in punishment\xe2\x80\x9d reveals that the conduct falling within subsection (b)(1)(A) is \xe2\x80\x9crough[ly] equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of risk, to the conduct falling within subsection (b)(1)(B).  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  More specifically, the Court claims that the Indiana Legislature added subsection (b)(1)(A) to the statute in 1998 because it determined that vehicular flight is <em>per se </em>risky\xe2\x80\x94and that all such flight therefore deserves the same punishment as is meted out to the various non-flight conduct that subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits upon a showing of risk.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12;<em> </em>see also n.\xc2\xa09, <em>supra</em>.  But that argument disregards the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to criminalize vehicular flight in <em>both </em>provisions\xe2\x80\x94that is, to retain subsection (b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on <em>risky</em> vehicular flight alongside subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on simple flight.  In effect, the Court reads subsection (b)(1)(A) as including all vehicular flight and subsection (b)(1)(B) as including only the other (non-flight) things it mentions\xe2\x80\x94even though subsection (b)(1)(B) specifically bars \xe2\x80\x9cflee[ing] from a law enforcement officer \xe2\x80\xa6 in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the Court assumes that the Indiana Legislature, in enacting subsection (b)(1)(A), simply forgot to remove the reference to vehicular flight in subsection (b)(1)(B).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 10 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (acknowledging superfluity).  But if so, the legis-lature forgot four more times to correct its error, as it\nserially amended and re-amended its vehicular-flight stat-\nute over the last 13 years.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  And more fundamentally, a better explanation than legislative mistake is available for Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enact subsection (b)(1)(A) while keeping subsection (b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on risky vehicular flight.  Prior to 1998, Indiana, unlike most other States in the nation, cf. <em>infra, </em>at 13, did not criminalize simple vehicular flight (<em>i.e.</em>, failure to stop) <em>at all</em>.  See 1998 Ind. Acts 677\xe2\x80\x93678.  So Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s decision to create that offense in subsection (b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94and to distinguish it from the more aggravated forms of vehicular flight already penalized under subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2), and (b)(3)\xe2\x80\x94brought\nthe State\xe2\x80\x99s vehicular-flight statute into conformity with the prevailing approach used nationwide.  Especially given that backdrop, I would not impute shoddy draftsmanship to the Indiana Legislature.  I would heed what that body said, rather than assume (just because it made both offenses class D felonies) that it must have meant something different.  And what the legislature said is that vehicular flight comes in different forms\xe2\x80\x94one posing substantial risk of injury (subsection (b)(1)(B)) and one not (subsection (b)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The best that can be said for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is that it is very narrow\xe2\x80\x94indeed, that it decides almost no case other than this one.  As noted above, see <em>supra</em>, at 10, the Court reserves the question whether a vehicular flight provision like subsection (b)(1)(A) is a crime of violence under ACCA \xe2\x80\x9cwhere that offense carries a less severe penalty than [a greater] offense that includes it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But as fate would have it, that reservation describes the great majority of vehicular flight statutes across the country.  Indiana is idiosyncratic in this respect; other States not only separately prohibit, but also differently punish, simple and aggravated vehicular flight.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Or perhaps I should say Indiana <em>was </em>idiosyncratic.  That is because in 2006, a few years after Sykes\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Indiana amended its vehicular flight statute to set different penalties for violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B).  A person who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) today faces a mandatory 30-day sentence that cannot be suspended; that sentence rises to six months or one year\nfor repeat offenders.  See Ind. Code \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(d).  By contrast, a person who violates subsection (b)(1)(A), even more than once, is not subject to any mandatory jail time.  See \xc2\xa735\xe2\x80\x9344\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x933(d)<em>.  </em>So by its own terms, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94our fourth applying ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause in as many years\xe2\x80\x94applies only to a single State\xe2\x80\x99s vehicular flight statute as it existed from 1998 to 2006.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 7 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e will be doing ad\xc2\xa0hoc application of ACCA . . . until the cows come home\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Indiana statute before us creates a series of escalating offenses dividing the universe of vehicular flight into discrete categories.  One of those categories, subsection (b)(1)(B), requires proof that the defendant operated \xe2\x80\x9ca vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  That phrase tracks the language that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause uses to define a crime of violence.  Other provisions in the Indiana statute demand even more\xe2\x80\x94actual injury or death.  In stark contrast, subsection (b)(1)(A), the least severe of the State\xe2\x80\x99s vehicular flight offenses and the one of which Sykes was convicted, lacks any element relating to threat of physical injury.  In deciding this case, I would respect that statutory difference.  And because I would take the Indiana Legislature at its word, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I understand the majority to retain the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d test, but to conclude that it is \xe2\x80\x9credundant\xe2\x80\x9d in this case.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  Like Justice Scalia, see <em>ante</em>, at 3 (dissenting opinion), I find this conclusion puzzling.  I do not think the majority could mean to limit the test to \xe2\x80\x9cstrict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (majority opinion).   As Justice Scalia notes, see <em>ante</em>, at 3,<em> </em>that would be to eliminate the test\xe2\x80\x99s focus on \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caggression.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it would collide with <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/122/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/122/index.html">555 U. S. 122</a> (2009)\xe2\x80\x94a decision the majority cites approvingly, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x94which applied the test to an intentional crime.  See 555 U.

So I assume this test will make a resurgence\xe2\x80\x94that it will be declared non-redundant\xe2\x80\x94the next time the Court considers a crime, whether intentional or not, that involves risk of injury but not aggression or violence.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to show that <em>Woodward</em> involved conduct more risky and violent than a simple failure to stop.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3; see also <em>ante</em>, at 7 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  But the facts of that case, like the facts of this one, are irrelevant.  Under ACCA, all that matters is the elements of the offense, and the Indiana Court of Appeals held in <em>Woodward </em>that a person who \xe2\x80\x9cmerely fail[s] to stop\xe2\x80\x9d for police, and does nothing more, commits a felony under state law.  770 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 900\xe2\x80\x93902.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, a driver may refrain from pulling over immediately out of concern for his own safety.  He may worry, for example, that road con-ditions make it hazardous to stop.  Or a driver may fear that the\nperson initiating the stop is a criminal rather than a police officer.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brennan, Rapist to Spend Life in Prison, Tampa Tribune, Feb. 18, 2011, Metro section, p.\xc2\xa03 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A man] impersonating a police officer \xe2\x80\xa6 used the ruse to pull over a woman \xe2\x80\xa6 and then kidnap and rape her\xe2\x80\x9d); DeKunder, Watch for \xe2\x80\x9cFake\xe2\x80\x9d Police, Local Authorities Warn, Northeast Herald, Jan. 14, 2010, pp.\xc2\xa012, 13 (noting several similar incidents).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government offers anecdotal examples and statistical surveys<font b="1"> of vehicular flights, see Brief for United States 13\xe2\x80\x9315, 17\xe2\x80\x9322, but none helps to answer whether the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d case of vehicular flight is aggravated or simple.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936 (Scalia, J., dissenting).<em> </em>The an-ecdotes and all but one of the surveys demonstrate only that some vehicular flights result in serious injury, a proposition no one does or could dispute.  The single statistical study cited by the Government that posits an injury rate for vehicular flight concludes that about 4% of 7,737 reported police pursuits harmed police or bystanders.  But that study may well involve only aggravated flights.  See C. Lum &amp; G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and Reform 55 (2008) (noting that the study relies on voluntary and non-systematic reporting and that participating police departments might not have reported \xe2\x80\x9cinformal\xe2\x80\x9d incidents).  And even assuming the study is comprehensive, it is entirely consistent with the possibility that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the most common form\xe2\x80\x94of vehicular flight is mere failure to stop, which produces a much lower rate of injury.</font></p><font b="1">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0After Sykes\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Indiana added yet a fifth degree.

But conduct that leads to serious injury or death is ordinarily more risky, viewed <em>ex ante</em>, than conduct that does not produce these results.  And in any event, the fundamental point here is that the Indiana statute grades vehicular flight according to the seriousness of the behavior\xe2\x80\x94ranging from flight that need not pose any risk of harm, through flight posing a substantial risk of harm, to flight involving a <em>certainty</em> of harm.  Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) thus underscore that Indiana has divided the world of vehicular flight into discrete, ascending crimes, rather than treating all vehicular flight as of a piece.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0None of this is to deny that prosecutors may sometimes charge violent and dangerous offenders under subsection (b)(1)(A).  A prosecutor may elect to use a lower grade of vehicular flight when he could use a higher one, either as a matter of discretion or because the defendant entered into a plea bargain.  This case provides one example, see <em>ante</em>, at 4 (majority opinion), and Justice Thomas offers several others, see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But as everyone agrees, what matters in determining whether an offense qualifies under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d of conviction.  And in the absence of reliable empirical evidence, the structure of the Indiana statute provides the best way to discern the ordinary case under each subsection.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government spurns the structural argument on a different ground, contending that subsection (b)(1)(A) is not a lesser included offense of subsection (b)(1)(B).  The Court wisely does not accept this claim.  Both<font b="1"> subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) involve the use of a vehicle to flee, with subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally requiring that this use \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] a substantial risk of bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  So a fleeing driver who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) necessarily runs afoul of subsection (b)(1)(A) as well.  The Government contends, in response, that a person can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) and <em>not</em> (b)(1)(A) by engaging in conduct <em>other than</em> vehicular flight.  See Brief for United States 48\xe2\x80\x9349, n.\xc2\xa011.  That is because subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct-[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cresist[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a police officer by a variety of means, including through use of a vehicle.  But Indiana law makes clear that subsec-\ntion (b)(1)(A) still counts as a lesser included offense of subsection (b)(1)(B) in any prosecution involving<font b="1"> vehicular flight.  See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>State</em>, 658 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 563, 566\xe2\x80\x93567 (Ind. 1995) (holding a crime to be a lesser included offense if its elements are \xe2\x80\x9cfactually\xe2\x80\x9d subsumed within another offense).  And even if that were not the case, it should make no difference.  The meaningful question for purposes of ACCA is whether subsection (b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of aggravated vehicular flight indicates that subsection (b)(1)(A) targets simple vehicular flight.  That a person can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) by means independent of <em>any</em> vehicular flight has no bearing on that question.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See 2011 Ind.
