The detectives waited for the men to leave and then followed the car approximately a mile before stopping it.  They found keys during a patdown search of Bailey, who initially said that he resided in the apartment but later denied it when informed of the search.  Both men were handcuffed and driven in a patrol car to the apartment, where the search team had already found a gun and illicit drugs.  After arresting the men, police discovered that one of Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s keys unlocked the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt trial, the District Court denied Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress the apartment key and the statements he made to the detectives when stopped, holding that Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention was justified under Michigan v. Summers, \n\n452 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692\n, as a detention incident to the execution of a search warrant, and, in the alternative, that the detention was supported by reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  Bailey was convicted.  The Second Circuit affirmed denial of the suppression motion.  Finding that Summers authorized Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention, it did not address the alternative Terry holding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The rule in Summers is limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched and does not apply here, where Bailey was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question.

Mena, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93\n.  Detention is permitted \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the character of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 98.  In Summers and later cases the detained occupants were found within or immediately outside the residence being searched.  Here, however, petitioner left the apartment before the search began and was detained nearly a mile away.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x88\x926.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0In Summers, the Court recognized three important law enforcement interests that, taken together, justify detaining an occupant who is on the premises during the search warrant\xe2\x80\x99s execution, 452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702\xe2\x88\x92703.  The first, officer safety, requires officers to secure the premises, which may include detaining current occupants so the officers can search without fear that the occupants will become disruptive, dangerous, or otherwise frustrate the search.  If an occupant returns home during the search, officers can mitigate the risk by taking routine precautions.  Here, however, Bailey posed little risk to the officers at the scene after he left the premises, apparently without knowledge of the search.  Had he returned, he could have been apprehended and detained under Summers.  Were police to have the authority to detain persons away from the premises, the authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detaining those who are on the scene.  As for the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s additional concerns, if officers believe that it would be dangerous to detain a departing individual in front of a residence, they are not required to stop him; and if officers have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, they can instead rely on Terry.  The risk that a departing occupant might alert those still inside the residence is also an insufficient safety rationale for expanding the detention authority beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second law enforcement interest is the facilitation of the completion of the search.  Unrestrained occupants can hide or destroy evidence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the way.  But a general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search cannot justify detention beyond the vicinity of the premises.  Occupants who are kept from leaving may assist the officers by opening locked doors or containers in order to avoid the use of force that can damage property or delay completion of the search.  But this justification must be confined to persons on site as the search warrant is executed and so in a position to observe the progression of the search.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe third interest is the interest in preventing flight, which also serves to preserve the integrity of the search.  If officers are concerned about flight in the event incriminating evidence is found, they might rush the search, causing unnecessary damage or compromising its careful execution.  The need to prevent flight, however, if unbounded, might be used to argue for detention of any regular occupant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search, e.g., detaining a suspect 10 miles away, ready to board a plane.  Even if the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could facilitate a later arrest if incriminating evidence is discovered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the \n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mincey v. Arizona, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, none of the three law enforcement interests identified in Summers applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.  And each is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in Summers to permit the detention of a former occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0As recognized in Summers, the detention of a current occupant \xe2\x80\x9crepresents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d 452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 703, but an arrest of an individual away from his home involves an additional level of intrusiveness.  A public detention, even if merely incident to a search, will resemble a full-fledged arrest and can involve the indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises.  P.\xc2\xa012.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0Limiting the rule in Summers to the area within which an occupant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search is confined to its underlying justification.  Because petitioner was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of immediate vicinity, there is no need to further define that term here.  Since detention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search, the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later time in a more remote place.

A search may be of a person, a thing, or a place.  So too a seizure may be of a person, a thing, or even a place.  A search or a seizure may occur singly or in combination, and in differing sequence.  In some cases the validity of one determines the validity of the other.  The instant case involves the search of a place (an apartment dwelling) and the seizure of a person.  But here, though it is acknowledged that the search was lawful, it does not follow that the seizure was lawful as well.  The seizure of the person is quite in question.  The issue to be resolved is whether the seizure of the person was reasonable when he was stopped and detained at some distance away from the premises to be searched when the only justification for the detention was to ensure the safety and efficacy of the search.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt 8:45 p.m. on July 28, 2005, local police obtained a warrant to search a residence for a .380-caliber handgun.  The residence was a basement apartment at 103 Lake Drive, in Wyandanch, New York.  A confidential informant had told police he observed the gun when he was at the apartment to purchase drugs from \xe2\x80\x9ca heavy set black male with short hair\xe2\x80\x9d known as \xe2\x80\x9cPolo.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9326.  As the search unit began preparations for executing the warrant, two officers, Detectives Richard Sneider and Richard Gorbecki, were conducting surveillance in an unmarked car outside the residence.  About 9:56 p.m., Sneider and Gorbecki observed two men\xe2\x80\x94later identified as petitioner Chunon Bailey and Bryant Middleton\xe2\x80\x94leave the gated area above the basement apartment and enter a car parked in the driveway.  Both matched the general physical description of \xe2\x80\x9cPolo\xe2\x80\x9d provided by the informant.  There was no indication that the men were aware of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 presence or had any knowledge of the impending search.  The detectives watched the car leave the driveway.  They waited for it to go a few hundred yards down the street and followed.  The detectives informed the search team of their intent to follow and detain the departing occupants.  The search team then executed the search warrant at the apartment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetectives Sneider and Gorbecki tailed Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s car for about a mile\xe2\x80\x94and for about five minutes\xe2\x80\x94before pulling the vehicle over in a parking lot by a fire station.  They ordered Bailey and Middleton out of the car and did a patdown search of both men.  The officers found no weapons but discovered a ring of keys in Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s pocket.  Bailey identified himself and said he was coming from his home at 103 Lake Drive.  His driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, however, showed his address as Bayshore, New York, the town where the confidential informant told the police the suspect, \xe2\x80\x9cPolo,\xe2\x80\x9d used to live.  Id., at 89.  Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s passenger, Middleton, said Bailey was giving him a ride home and confirmed they were coming from Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s residence at 103 Lake Drive.  The officers put both men in handcuffs.  When Bailey asked why, Gorbecki stated that they were being detained incident to the execution of a search warrant at 103 Lake Drive.  Bailey responded: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t live there.  Anything you find there ain\xe2\x80\x99t mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not cooperating with your investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 57, 77.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe detectives called for a patrol car to take Bailey and Middleton back to the Lake Drive apartment.  Detective Sneider drove the unmarked car back, while Detective Gorbecki used Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s set of keys to drive Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s car back to the search scene.  By the time the group returned to 103 Lake Drive, the search team had discovered a gun and drugs in plain view inside the apartment.  Bailey and Middleton were placed under arrest, and Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s keys were seized incident to the arrest.  Officers later discovered that one of Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s keys opened the door of the basement apartment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBailey was charged with three federal offenses: possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii); possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(i).  At trial Bailey moved to suppress the apartment key and the statements he made when stopped by Detectives Sneider and Gorbecki.  That evidence, Bailey argued, derived from an unreasonable seizure.  After an evidentiary hearing the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York denied the motion to suppress.  The District Court held that Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention was permissible under Michigan v. Summers, \n\n452 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692 (1981)\n, as a detention incident to the execution of a search warrant.  In the alternative, it held that Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention was lawful as an investigatory detention supported by reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1968)\n.  After a trial the jury found Bailey guilty on all three counts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention was proper and affirmed denial of the suppression motion.  It interpreted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Summers to \xe2\x80\x9cauthoriz[e] law enforcement to detain the occupant of premises subject to a valid search warrant when that person is seen leaving those premises and the detention is effected as soon as reasonably practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  652 F.\xc2\xa03d 197, 208 (2011).  Having found Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention justified under Summers, the Court of Appeals did not address the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s alternative holding that the stop was permitted under Terry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions as to whether Michigan v.

In Summers, the defendant was detained on a walk leading down from the front steps of the house.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in O. T. 1980, No. 79\xe2\x80\x931794, pp. 41\xe2\x80\x9342; see also Muehler, supra, at 96 (detention of occupant in adjoining garage); Los Angeles County v. Rettele, \n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609, \n611 (2007)\n (per curiam) (detention of occupants in bedroom).  Here, however, petitioner left the apartment before the search began; and the police officers waited to detain him until he was almost a mile away.  The issue is whether the reasoning in Summers can justify detentions beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises being searched.  An exception to the \n \nFourth Amendment rule prohibiting detention absent probable cause must not diverge from its purpose and rationale.  See Florida v. Royer, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491, \n500 (1983)\n (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is necessary, then, to discuss the reasons for the rule explained in Summers to determine if its rationale extends to a detention like the one here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Summers, the Court recognized three important law enforcement interests that, taken together, justify the detention of an occupant who is on the premises during the execution of a search warrant: officer safety, facilitating the completion of the search, and preventing flight.  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702\xe2\x80\x93703.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first interest identified in Summers was \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 702.  There the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 702\xe2\x80\x93703.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen law enforcement officers execute a search warrant, safety considerations require that they secure the premises, which may include detaining current occupants.  By taking \xe2\x80\x9cunquestioned command of the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 703, the officers can search without fear that occupants, who are on the premises and able to observe the course of the search, will become disruptive, dangerous, or otherwise frustrate the search. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter Summers, this Court decided Muehler v. Mena.  The reasoning and conclusions in Muehler in applying the Summers rule go quite far in allowing seizure and detention of persons to accommodate the necessities of a search.  There, the person detained and held in handcuffs was not suspected of the criminal activity being investigated; but, the Court held, she could be detained nonetheless, to secure the premises while the search was underway.  The \xe2\x80\x9csafety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for weapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs, [and] the need to detain multiple occupants made the use of handcuffs all the more reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 100.  While the Court in Muehler did remand for consideration of whether the detention there\xe2\x80\x94alleged to have been two or three hours\xe2\x80\x94was necessary in light of all the circumstances, the fact that so prolonged a detention indeed might have been permitted illustrates the far-reaching authority the police have when the detention is made at the scene of the search.  This in turn counsels caution before extending the power to detain persons stopped or apprehended away from the premises where the search is being conducted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is likely, indeed almost inevitable in the case of a resident, that an occupant will return to the premises at some point; and this might occur when the officers are still conducting the search.  Officers can and do mitigate that risk, however, by taking routine precautions, for instance by erecting barricades or posting someone on the perimeter or at the door.  In the instant case Bailey had left the premises, apparently without knowledge of the search.  He posed little risk to the officers at the scene.  If Bailey had rushed back to his apartment, the police could have apprehended and detained him under Summers.  There is no established principle, however, that allows the arrest of anyone away from the premises who is likely to return.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe risk, furthermore, that someone could return home during the execution of a search warrant is not limited to occupants who depart shortly before the start of a search.  The risk that a resident might return home, either for reasons unrelated to the search or after being alerted by someone at the scene, exists whether he left five minutes or five hours earlier.  Unexpected arrivals by occupants or other persons accustomed to visiting the premises might occur in many instances.  Were police to have the authority to detain those persons away from the premises, the authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detaining those who are in fact on the scene.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals relied on an additional safety consideration.  It concluded that limiting the application of the authority to detain to the immediate vicinity would put law enforcement officers in a dilemma.  They would have to choose between detaining an individual immediately (and risk alerting occupants still inside) or allowing the individual to leave (and risk not being able to arrest him later if incriminating evidence were discovered).  652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  Although the danger of alerting occupants who remain inside may be of real concern in some instances, as in the case when a no-knock warrant has been issued, this safety rationale rests on the false premise that a detention must take place.  If the officers find that it would be dangerous to detain a departing individ-ual in front of a residence, they are not required to stop him.  And, where there are grounds to believe the departing occupant is dangerous, or involved in criminal activity, police will generally not need Summers to detain him at least for brief questioning, as they can rely instead on Terry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe risk that a departing occupant might notice the police surveillance and alert others still inside the residence is also an insufficient safety rationale to justify ex-panding the existing categorical authority to detain so that it extends beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.  If extended in this way the rationale would justify detaining anyone in the neighborhood who could alert occupants that the police are outside, all without individualized suspicion of criminal activity or connection to the residence to be searched.  This possibility demonstrates why it is necessary to confine the Summers rule to those who are present when and where the search is being conducted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second law enforcement interest relied on in Summers was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe orderly completion of the search may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 703.  This interest in efficiency derives from distinct, but related, concerns.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf occupants are permitted to wander around the premises, there is the potential for interference with the execution of the search warrant.  They can hide or destroy evidence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the way.  Those risks are not presented by an occupant who departs beforehand.  So, in this case, after Bailey drove away from the Lake Drive apartment, he was not a threat to the proper execution of the search.  Had he returned, officers would have been free to detain him at that point.  A general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search, however, cannot justify detention beyond the vicinity of the premises to be searched.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSummers also noted that occupants can assist the offi-cers.  Under the reasoning in Summers, the occupants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cself-interest may induce them to open locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This justification must be confined to those persons who are on site and so in a position, when detained, to at once observe the progression of the search; and it would have no limiting principle were it to be applied to persons beyond the premises of the search.  Here, it appears the police officers decided to wait until Bailey had left the vicinity of the search before detaining him.  In any event it later became clear to the officers that Bailey did not wish to cooperate.  See App. 57, 77 (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t live there.  Anything you find there ain\xe2\x80\x99t mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not cooperating with your investigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, by the time the officers brought Bailey back to the apartment, the search team had discovered contraband.  Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention thus served no purpose in ensuring the efficient completion of the search.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe third law enforcement interest addressed in Summers was the \xe2\x80\x9cthe legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702.  The proper interpretation of this language, in the context of Summers and in the broader context of the reasonableness standard that must govern and inform the detention incident to a search, is that the police can prohibit an occupant from leaving the scene of the search.  As with the other interests identified in Summers, this justification serves to preserve the integrity of the search by controlling those persons who are on the scene.  If police officers are concerned about flight, and have to keep close supervision of occupants who are not restrained, they might rush the search, causing unnecessary damage to property or compromising its careful execution.  Allowing officers to secure the scene by detaining those present also prevents the search from being impeded by occupants leaving with the evidence being sought or the means to find it.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concern over flight is not because of the danger of flight itself but because of the damage that potential flight can cause to the integrity of the search.  This interest does not independently justify detention of an occupant be- yond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.  The need to prevent flight, if unbounded, might be used to argue for detention, while a search is underway, of any regular occupant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search.  If not circumscribed, the rationale of preventing flight would justify, for instance, detaining a suspect who is 10 miles away, ready to board a plane.  The interest in preventing escape from police cannot extend this far without undermining the usual rules for arrest based on probable cause or a brief stop for questioning under standards derived from Terry.  Even if the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could facilitate a later arrest should incriminating evidence be discovered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the \n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mincey v. Arizona, \n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, \n393 (1978)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, of the three law enforcement interests identified to justify the detention in Summers, none applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.  Any of the individual interests is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in Summers to permit the detention of a former occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search.  This would give officers too much discretion.  The categorical authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant must be limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Summers, the Court recognized the authority to detain occupants incident to the execution of a search warrant not only in light of the law enforcement interests at stake but also because the intrusion on personal liberty was limited.  The Court held detention of a current occupant \xe2\x80\x9crepresents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 703.  Because the detention occurs in the individual\xe2\x80\x99s own home, \xe2\x80\x9cit could add only minimally to the public stigma associated with the search itself and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the indignity associated with a compelled visit to the police station.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 702.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhere officers arrest an individual away from his home, however, there is an additional level of intrusiveness.  A public detention, even if merely incident to a search, will resemble a full-fledged arrest.  As demonstrated here, detention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an initial detention away from the scene and a second detention at the residence.  In between, the individual will suffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises, giving all the appearances of an arrest.  The detention here was more intrusive than a usual detention at the search scene.  Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s car was stopped; he was ordered to step out and was detained in full public view; he was handcuffed, transported in a marked patrol car, and detained further outside the apartment.  These facts illustrate that detention away from a premises where police are already present often will be more intrusive than detentions at the scene. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSummers recognized that a rule permitting the detention of occupants on the premises during the execution of a search warrant, even absent individualized suspicion, was reasonable and necessary in light of the law enforcement interests in conducting a safe and efficient search.  Because this exception grants substantial authority to police officers to detain outside of the traditional rules of the \n \nFourth Amendment, it must be circumscribed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA spatial constraint defined by the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched is therefore required for detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant.  The police action permitted here\xe2\x80\x94the search of a residence\xe2\x80\x94has a spatial dimension, and so a spatial or geographical boundary can be used to determine the area within which both the search and detention incident to that search may occur.  Limiting the rule in Summers to the area in which an occupant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search is confined to its underlying justification.  Once an occupant is beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched, the search-related law enforcement interests are diminished and the intrusiveness of the detention is more severe.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, petitioner was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question; and so this case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to further define the meaning of immediate vicinity.  In closer cases courts can consider a number of factors to determine whether an occupant was detained within the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched, including the lawful limits of the premises, whether the occupant was within the line of sight of his dwelling, the ease of reentry from the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s location, and other relevant factors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConfining an officer\xe2\x80\x99s authority to detain under Summers to the immediate vicinity of a premises to be searched is a proper limit because it accords with the rationale of the rule.  The rule adopted by the Court of Appeals here, allowing detentions of a departed occupant \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as reasonably practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d departs from the spatial limit that is necessary to confine the rule in light of the substantial intrusions on the liberty of those detained.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause detention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search, the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later time in a more remote place.  If officers elect to defer the detention until the suspect or departing occupant leaves the immediate vicinity, the lawfulness of detention is controlled by other standards, including, of course, a brief stop for questioning based on reasonable suspicion under Terry or an arrest based on probable cause.  A suspect\xe2\x80\x99s particular actions in leaving the scene, including whether he appears to be armed or fleeing with the evidence sought, and any information the officers acquire from those who are conducting the search, including information that incriminating evidence has been discovered, will bear, of course, on the lawfulness of a later stop or detention.  For example, had the search team radioed Detectives Sneider and Gorbecki about the gun and drugs discovered in the Lake Drive apartment as the officers stopped Bailey and Middleton, this may have provided them with probable cause for an arrest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetentions incident to the execution of a search warrant are reasonable under the \n \nFourth Amendment because the limited intrusion on personal liberty is outweighed by the special law enforcement interests at stake.  Once an individual has left the immediate vicinity of a premises to be searched, however, detentions must be justified by some other rationale.  In this respect it must be noted that the District Court, as an alternative ruling, held that stopping petitioner was lawful under Terry.  This opinion expresses no view on that issue.  It will be open, on remand, for the Court of Appeals to address the matter and to determine whether, assuming the Terry stop was valid, it yielded information that justified the detention the officers then imposed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970561">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x93770\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tCHUNON L.

See id., at 701\xe2\x80\x93704.  Weighing those factors, the Court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cit is constitutionally reasonable to require [a] citizen to remain while officers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 705.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe existence and scope of the Summers exception were predicated on that balancing of the interests and burdens.  But\xe2\x80\x94crucially\xe2\x80\x94whether Summers authorizes a seizure in an individual case does not depend on any balancing, because the Summers exception, within its scope, is \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Muehler v. Mena, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93, \n98 (2005)\n.  That Summers establishes a categorical, bright-line rule is simply not open to debate\xe2\x80\x94Summers itself insisted on it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an ad\xc2\xa0hoc determination, because the officer is not required to evaluate either the quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 705, n.\xc2\xa019.

Weighing the equities\xe2\x80\x94Bailey \xe2\x80\x9cposed a risk of harm to the officers,\xe2\x80\x9d his detention \xe2\x80\x9cwas not unreasonably prolonged,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth\xe2\x80\x94the Court of Appeals proclaimed the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, \xe2\x80\x9cin the circumstances presented, reasonable and prudent.\xe2\x80\x9d  652 F.\xc2\xa03d 197, 206 (CA2 2011) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also post, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  That may be so, but it is irrelevant to whether Summers authorized the officers to seize Bailey without probable cause.  To resolve that issue, a court need ask only one question: Was the person seized within \xe2\x80\x9cthe immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched\xe2\x80\x9d?  Ante, at 11.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals read Summers\xe2\x80\x99 spatial constraint somewhat more promiscuously: In its view, it sufficed that police observed Bailey \xe2\x80\x9cin the process of leaving the premises\xe2\x80\x9d and detained him \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 206 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  That has pragmatic appeal; police, the argument runs, should not be precluded from seizing the departing occupant at a distance from the premises if that would be safer than stopping him on the front steps.  But it rests on the fallacy that each search warrant entitles the Government to a concomitant Summers detention.  Conducting a Summers seizure incident to the execution of a warrant \xe2\x80\x9cis not the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right; it is an exception\xe2\x80\x94justified by necessity\xe2\x80\x94to a rule that would otherwise render the [seizure] unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thornton v.

New York, \n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 200, \n213 (1979)\n.  Summers embodies a categorical judgment that in one narrow circumstance\xe2\x80\x94the presence of occupants during the execution of a search warrant\xe2\x80\x94seizures are reasonable despite the absence of probable cause.  Sum- mers itself foresaw that without clear limits its excep- tion could swallow the general rule: If a \xe2\x80\x9cmultifactor balancing test of \xe2\x80\x98reasonable police conduct under the cir-cumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d were extended \xe2\x80\x9cto cover all seizures that do not amount to technical arrests,\xe2\x80\x9d it recognized, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98protections intended by the Framers could all too easily dis-appear in the consideration and balancing of the multi-farious circumstances presented by different cases.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 705, n.\xc2\xa019 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at 213 (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  The dissent would harvest from Summers what it likes (permission to seize without probable cause) and leave behind what it finds uncongenial (limitation of that permission to a narrow, categorical exception, not an open-ended \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry).*  Summers anticipated that gambit and explicitly disavowed the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s balancing test.  See 452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 705, n.\xc2\xa019 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an ad\xc2\xa0hoc determination\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRegrettably, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Summers facilitated the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 error here by setting forth a smorgasbord of law-enforcement interests assertedly justifying its holding, including \xe2\x80\x9cpreventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found\xe2\x80\x9d and obtaining residents\xe2\x80\x99 assistance in \xe2\x80\x9copen[ing] locked doors or locked containers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 701\xe2\x80\x93703.  We should not have been so expansive.  The Summers exception is appropriately predicated only on law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s interest in carrying out the search unimpeded by violence or other disruptions.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe common denominator\xe2\x80\x9d of the few \n \nFourth Amendment doctrines permitting seizures based on less than probable cause \xe2\x80\x9cis the presence of some governmental interest independent of the ordinary interest in investigating crime and apprehending suspects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 707 (Stewart, J., dissenting).  Preventing flight is not a special governmental interest\xe2\x80\x94it is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in apprehending suspects.  Similarly, the interest in inducing residents to open locked doors or containers is nothing more than the ordinary interest in investigating crime.  That Summers detentions aid police in uncovering evidence and nabbing criminals does not distinguish them from the mine run of seizures unsupported by probable cause, which the \n \nFourth Amendment generally proscribes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSummers\xe2\x80\x99 clear rule simplifies the task of officers who encounter occupants during a search.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f police are to have workable rules, the balancing of the competing in-terests .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98must in large part be done on a categorical basis\xe2\x80\x94not in an ad hoc, case-by-case fashion by individual police officers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 705, n.\xc2\xa019 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at 219\xe2\x80\x93220 (White, J., concurring)); see also Ari- zona v.

In Michigan v. Summers, \n\n452 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692 (1981)\n, this Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implic-itly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occu-pants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 705 (footnote omitted).  And the similarities between Summers and this case are multiple.  In Summers the police had a valid warrant based on probable cause to search a house for drugs.  Id., at 693.  Here the police had a valid warrant based on probable cause to search a house for a gun and ammunition, believed to be used in multiple drug deals.  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9318, 26.  In Summers the police, beginning to execute that warrant, were outside the house.  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 693.  Here the police, beginning to execute that warrant, were outside the house.  468 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 376.  In Summers the police then \xe2\x80\x9cencountered\xe2\x80\x9d an occupant of the house \xe2\x80\x9cdescending the front steps.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 693.  Here the police then encountered two occupants of the house ascending the back (basement) steps.  468 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 376; App. 43, 45.  In Summers the police entered the house soon after encountering that occupant.  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 693. Here the police entered the house soon after encountering those occupants (while other officers pursued them).  App. 49, 59\xe2\x80\x9360.  In Summers the police detained the occupant while they engaged in their search.  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 693.  Here the police did the same.  468 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 377.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, given Summers, only one question is open.  In Summers the police detained the occupant before he left \xe2\x80\x9cthe sidewalk outside\xe2\x80\x9d of the house.  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702, n.\xc2\xa016.  Here the police, for good reason, permitted the occupants to leave the premises and stopped them a few blocks from the house.  App. 48, 72, 86, 103.  (See Appendix, infra.)  The resulting question is whether this difference makes a constitutional difference.  In particular, which is the right constitutional line to demarcate where a Summers detention may be initiated?  Is it the Court\xe2\x80\x99s line, drawn at the \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate vicinity\xe2\x80\x9d of the house?  Ante, at 12.  Or is it the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s line, drawn on the basis of what is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably practicable\xe2\x80\x9d?  652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 207.  I agree, of course, with the concurrence that the question involves drawing a line of demarcation granting a categorical form of detention authority.  The question is simply where that line should be drawn.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court in Summers rested its conclusion upon four considerations, each of which strongly supports the reasonableness of Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s detention, and each of which is as likely or more likely to support detention of an occupant of searchable premises detained \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as reasonably practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d 652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 208, as it is to support the detention of an occupant detained \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the immediate vicinity\xe2\x80\x9d of those premises, ante, at 13.  First, the Court in Summers found \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f prime importance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the fact that the police had obtained a warrant to search [the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s] house for contraband.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 701.  That fact meant that the additional detention-related \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of the privacy of the persons who resided there\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cless intrusive\xe2\x80\x9d than in a typical detention.  Ibid.  The same is true here and always true in this class of cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Court in Summers said that the detention was justified in part by \xe2\x80\x9cthe legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 702.  This factor, which Summers identifies as the \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost obvious\xe2\x80\x9d rationale supporting detention, ibid., will be present in all Summers detentions.  Summers applies when police have a search warrant for contraband, id., at 701, 705, n.\xc2\xa020, and any occupant departing a residence containing contraband will have incentive to flee once he encounters police.  Indeed, since here the warrant itself described the possessor of the unlawful gun in terms that applied to both of the detained occupants, App. 46, the strength of this interest is equal to or greater than its strength in Summers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the Court in Summers said that the detention was justified in part by \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 702.  The strength of this interest is greater here than in Summers, for here there was good reason, backed by probable cause, to believe that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] chrome .380 handgun, ammunition, [and] magazine clips\xe2\x80\x9d were on the premises.  App. 17.  As I discuss below, the interest in minimizing harm to officers is compromised by encouraging them to initiate searches before they are prepared to do so safely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the Court in Summers said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe orderly completion of the search may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 703.  The strength of this interest here is equal to its strength in Summers.  See, e.g., United States v. Montieth, 662 F.\xc2\xa03d 660, 663 (CA4 2011) (After being followed, detained, and returned to his home, Montieth helped officers find \xe2\x80\x9cmarijuana, firearms, and cash\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court in Summers did not emphasize any other consideration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is, however, one further consideration, namely an administrative consideration.  A bright line will sometimes help police more easily administer \n \nFourth Amendment rules, while also helping to ensure that the police do not go beyond the bounds of the reasonable.  The majority, however, offers no easily administered bright line.  It de-scribes its line as one drawn at \xe2\x80\x9cthe immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched,\xe2\x80\x9d to be determined by \xe2\x80\x9ca number of factors .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. including [but not limited to] the lawful limits of the premises, whether the occupant was within the line of sight of his dwelling, the ease of reentry from the occupant\xe2\x80\x99s location, and other relevant factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s line invites case-by-case litigation although, divorced as it is from interests that directly motivate the \n \nFourth Amendment, it offers no clear case-by-case guidance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, as the lower courts pointed out, considerations related to the risks of flight, of evidence destruction, and of physical danger overcome any administrative advantages.  Consider why the officers here waited until the occupants had left the block to stop them: They did so because the occupants might have been armed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, even if those emerging occupants were not armed (and even if the police knew it), those emerging occupants might have seen the officers outside the house.  And they might have alerted others inside the house where, as we now know (and the officers had probable cause to believe), there was a gun lying on the floor in plain view.  App. 202.  Suppose those inside the house, once alerted, had tried to flee with the evidence.  Suppose they had destroyed the evidence.  Suppose that one of them had picked up the gun and fired when the officers entered.  Suppose that an individual inside the house (perhaps under the influence of drugs) had grabbed the gun and begun to fire through the window, endangering police, neighbors, or families passing by.  See id., at 26 (informant describing gun\xe2\x80\x99s relation to drugs in the house).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsiderations of this kind reveal the dangers inherent in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s effort to draw a semi-bright line.  And they show the need here and in this class of cases to test the constitutionality of the details of a search warrant\xe2\x80\x99s execution by taking more directly into account concerns related to safety, evidence, and flight, i.e., the kinds of concerns more directly related to the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cultimate touchstone of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kentucky v.

Quite right.  But that response is not convincing.  After all, the police do not know whether an emerging individual has seen an officer.  If he has, the risks are as I have described them, e.g., that those inside may learn of imminent police entry and fire the gun.  In any event, the police may fear that they might be or have been spotted.  And they may consequently feel the need, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, to seize the emerging individual just before he leaves the \xe2\x80\x9cvicinity\xe2\x80\x9d but just too soon to guard against the danger of physical harm inherent in any search for guns.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority adds that, where the departing individ-uals themselves are dangerous, Terry v.

The seizures the majority imagines, however, strike me as red herrings, for I do not see how they could be justified as having taken place as soon as \xe2\x80\x9creasonably practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, the majority can find no such example in any actual case\xe2\x80\x94even though almost every Court of Appeals to have considered the matter has taken the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach.

The difference is obvious: A hypothetical occupant 10 miles away from the searchable premises is less likely to learn of the search (and thus less likely to alert those inside or return to disrupt the search) than is an occupant like Bailey, who may perceive the police presence without alerting the police to the fact that he noticed them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is even less likely\xe2\x80\x94indeed impossible\xe2\x80\x94that the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s rule would (as the majority claims) permit \xe2\x80\x9cdetaining anyone in the neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9, for the rule explicitly applies only to those \xe2\x80\x9cin the process of leaving the premises,\xe2\x80\x9d 652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore fundamentally, Summers explained that detention incident to a search is permissible because, once police have obtained a search warrant, they \xe2\x80\x9chave an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 699.  That articulable, individualized suspicion attaches to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly describ[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. place to be searched.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 4.  In turn, the connection between individualized suspicion of that place and individualized suspicion of \xe2\x80\x9can individual in the process of leaving the premises\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficiently tight to justify detention.  652 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.  That connection dissipates when the individual is not actually leaving the premises where, according to a neutral magistrate, there is probable cause to believe contraband can be found, and the Summers justification therefore does not apply.  Hence, Summers applies only where the connection between the searchable premises and the detained occupant is as tight as it is in cases like Summers and this one: In both, a departing occupant had just left his home and was merely turned around and escorted back there for the duration of a search.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, I believe that the majority has substituted a line based on indeterminate geography for a line based on realistic considerations related to basic \n \nFourth Amendment concerns such as privacy, safety, evidence destruction, and flight.
