JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On petition of Insurance Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, and over the protest of respondent, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, as to the appropriateness of the bargaining unit, the National Labor Relations Board, in a proceeding under \xc2\xa7 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 453, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(c) (1958 ed.), certified the union as the bargaining representative of all debit insurance agents, including all canvassing regular and office account agents at respondent\'s district office in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondent deliberately refused to bargain with the union in order to challenge the appropriateness of the employee unit certified by the Board.  <em>See Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. Labor Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/146/case.html">313 U. S. 146</a></span>.  The union thereupon filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board.  The Board, adhering to its prior unit determination, held that respondent violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 158(a)(1) and (5) (1958 ed.), and directed respondent to bargain with the union.  142 N.L.R.B. 491.

Board . . . has indeed . . . [regarded] the extent of union organization as controlling in violation of \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5) of the Act."</p>\n<p>327 F.2d at 911.  We granted certiorari because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 380 U. S. 441</a></p><p> of an apparent conflict between this decision and the decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board,</em> 328 F.2d 820, <em>petition for certiorari pending,</em> No. 56 this Term, which sustained the Board\'s determination in the Delaware case, 138 N.L.R.B. 565, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board,</em> 330 F.2d 62, <em>petition for certiorari pending,</em> No. 229 this Term, which sustained the Board\'s determination in the Cleveland case, 138 N.L.R.B. 512.  <em>See also National Labor Relations Board v. Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co.,</em> 328 F.2d 891 (C.A.3d Cir.), <em>petition for certiorari pending,</em> No. 91 this Term.</p>\n<p>Section 9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 453, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(b) (1958 ed.) provides:</p>\n<p>"The Board shall decide in each case whether, in order to assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this subchapter, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof. . . ."</p>\n<p>This broad delegation of authority, <em>see Pittsburgh Glass Co. v. Labor Board, supra,</em> was limited in 1947 by the enactment of \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5) of the Act, 61 Stat. 144, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(c)(5) (1958 ed.), which provides that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n determining whether a unit is appropriate for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section, the extent to which the employees have organized shall not be controlling."</p>\n<p>Although it is clear that, in passing this amendment, Congress intended to overrule Board decisions where the unit determined could only be supported on the basis of the extent of organization, both the language and legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 380 U. S. 442</a></p><p> history [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] of \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5) demonstrate that the provision was not intended to prohibit the Board from considering the extent of organization as one factor, though not the controlling factor, in its unit determination. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals here properly recognized this effect of \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5), but held, in light of the unarticulated bases of decision, and what appeared to it to be inconsistent determinations approving units requested by the union, that the only conclusion that it could reach was that the Board has made the extent of organization the controlling factor, in violation of the congressional mandate.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the enforcing court should not overlook or ignore an evasion of the \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5) command.  We further agree that, in determining whether or not there has been such an evasion, the results in other recent decisions of the Board are relevant.  We cannot, however, agree that the only possible conclusion here is that the Board has violated \xc2\xa7 9(c)(5).  <em>Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board (Cleveland), supra; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board (Delaware), supra.</em></p>\n<p>On the other hand, due to the Board\'s lack of articulated reasons for the decisions in and distinctions among these cases, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the Board\'s action here cannot be properly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 380 U. S. 443</a></p><p> reviewed.  When the Board so exercises the discretion given to it by Congress, it must "disclose the basis of its order" and "give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it."

The nearest district office is located 12 miles away, in Pawtucket.  In the prior proceeding in Case No. 4-RC-4865, based on the same record incorporated by reference herein, we found that each of Employer\'s individual district offices was, in effect, a separate administrative entity through which the Employer conducted its business operations, and therefore was inherently appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.  <em>See Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,</em> 138 NLRB . . . (565).  Applying the tests set forth therein, we find that, since there is no recent history of collective bargaining, no union seeking a larger unit, and the district office sought is located in a separate and distinct geographical area, the employees located at the Woonsocket district office constitute an appropriate unit.  <em>See also Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,</em> . . . [138] NLRB . . . [734]."</p>\n<p>The cases cited are the Board\'s decisions in the Delaware and Sioux City cases discussed <em>supra.</em>  They do not appear, because of their variant factual circumstances, to be direct authority for decision in this case.  Moreover, the Board made no attempt to distinguish other cases, particularly the Chicago and Cleveland cases discussed <em>supra,</em> in which it certified different types of units.  The unfair labor practice proceeding added nothing to the analysis, as the trial examiner did not review the issue, as he felt "bound by the Board\'s ruling in the representation proceeding," 142 N.L.R.B. at 492, and the Board affirmed the trial examiner\'s ruling without discussion, <em>id.</em> at 491.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, the Board may articulate the basis of its order by reference to other decisions or its general policies laid down in its rules and its annual reports, reflecting its "cumulative experience," <em>Labor Board v.

The employer sought review of the Board\'s order, asking that it be set aside.  Concededly, it should be.  But we need not act as <em>amicus</em> for the Board, telling it what to do.  The Board is powerful and resourceful, and can start over again should it wish.  How stale this record may be we do not know.  Neither of the parties asks for a remand.
