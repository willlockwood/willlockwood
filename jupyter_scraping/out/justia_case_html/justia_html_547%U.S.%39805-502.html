Entering the yard, they saw through a screen door and windows an altercation in the kitchen between four adults and a juvenile, who punched one of the adults, causing him to spit blood in a sink.  An officer opened the screen door and announced the officers\xe2\x80\x99 presence.  Unnoticed amid the tumult, the officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, whereupon the altercation gradually subsided.  The officers arrested respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and related offenses.  The trial court granted their motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home on the ground that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court held that the injury caused by the juvenile\xe2\x80\x99s punch was insufficient to trigger the \xe2\x80\x9cemergency aid doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d because it did not give rise to an objectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, semiconscious, or missing person feared injured or dead was in the home.  Furthermore, the court suggested the doctrine was inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult but had acted exclusively in a law enforcement capacity.  The court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Police may enter a home without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate touchstone is \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.

This Court has repeatedly rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that, in assessing the reasonableness of an entry, consideration should be given to the subjective motivations of individual officers.  Because the officers\xe2\x80\x99 subjective motivation is irrelevant, <em>Bond</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/334/index.html">529 U.

This contention is misplaced.  In <em>Welsh</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9conly potential emergency\xe2\x80\x9d confronting the officers was the need to preserve evidence of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol level, an exigency the Court held insufficient under the circumstances to justify a warrantless entry into the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s home.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Here, the officers were confronted with <em>ongoing</em> violence occurring <em>within</em> the home, a situation <em>Welsh </em>did not address.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry here was plainly reasonable under the circumstances.

Moreover, in light of the fracas they observed in the kitchen, the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence was just beginning.  Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until another blow rendered someone unconscious, semiconscious, or worse before entering.  The manner of their entry was also reasonable, since nobody heard the first announcement of their presence, and it was only after the announcing officer stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again that the tumult subsided.  That announcement was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door and, under the circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s knock-and-announce rule.  Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to make them stand dumbly at the door awaiting a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their presence.

We conclude that they may.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises out of a melee that occurred in a Brigham City, Utah, home in the early morning hours of July 23, 2000.  At about 3 a.m., four police officers responded to a call regarding a loud party at a residence.  Upon arriving at the house, they heard shouting from inside, and proceeded down the driveway to investigate.  There, they observed two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard.  They entered the backyard, and saw\xe2\x80\x94through a screen door and windows\xe2\x80\x94an altercation taking place in the kitchen of the home.  According to the testimony of one of the officers, four adults were attempting, with some difficulty, to restrain a juvenile.  The juvenile eventually \xe2\x80\x9cbroke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in the face.\xe2\x80\x9d  2005 UT 13, \xc2\xb62, 122 P.\xc2\xa03d 506, 508.  The officer testified that he observed the victim of the blow spitting blood into a nearby sink.  App. 40.  The other adults continued to try to restrain the juvenile, pressing him up against a refrigerator with such force that the refrigerator began moving across the floor.  At this point, an officer opened the screen door and announced the officers\xe2\x80\x99 presence.  Amid the tumult, nobody noticed.  The officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, and as the occupants slowly became aware that the police were on the scene, the altercation ceased.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officers subsequently arrested respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication.  In the trial court, respondents filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home, arguing that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment.  The court granted the motion, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the Supreme Court of Utah, Brigham City argued that although the officers lacked a warrant, their entry was nevertheless reasonable on either of two grounds.  The court rejected both contentions and, over two dissenters, affirmed.  First, the court held that the injury caused by the juvenile\xe2\x80\x99s punch was insufficient to trigger the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cemergency aid doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d because it did not give rise to an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0objectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, semi-conscious, or missing person feared injured or dead [was] in the home.\xe2\x80\x9d  122 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 513 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Furthermore, the court suggested that the doctrine was inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult, but instead had acted \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively in their law enforcement capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.  This exception applies, the court explained, where police have probable cause and where \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable person [would] believe that the entry was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under this standard, the court stated, the potential harm need not be as serious as that required to invoke the emergency aid exception.  Although it found the case \xe2\x80\x9ca close and difficult call,\xe2\x80\x9d the court nevertheless concluded that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry was not justified by exigent circumstances.  <em>Id.,</em> at 515.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), in light of differences among state courts and the Courts of Appeals concerning the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard governing warrantless entry by law enforcement in an emergency situation.

Nevertheless, because the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.  <em>Flippo</em> v. <em>West Virginia, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/11/index.html">528 U.

Accordingly, law enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.  <em>Mincey, supra,</em> at 392; see also<em> Georgia</em> v. <em>Randolph,</em> 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering \xe2\x80\xa6 to determine whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents do not take issue with these principles, but instead advance two reasons why the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry here was unreasonable.  First, they argue that the officers were more interested in making arrests than quelling violence.  They urge us to consider, in assessing the reasonableness of the entry, whether the officers were \xe2\x80\x9cindeed motivated primarily by a desire to save lives and property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 3; see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6 (entry to render emergency assistance justifies a search \xe2\x80\x9conly when the searching officer is acting outside his traditional law-enforcement capacity\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Utah Supreme Court also considered the officers\xe2\x80\x99 subjective motivations relevant.  See 122 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 513 (search under the \xe2\x80\x9cemergency aid doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d may not be \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases have repeatedly rejected this approach.  An action is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively</em>, justify [the] action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/128/index.html">436 U. S. 128</a>, 138 (1978) (emphasis added).  The officer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective motivation is irrelevant.  See <em>Bond</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/334/index.html">529 U. S. 334</a>, 338, n.\xc2\xa02 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe parties properly agree that the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in determining whether that officer\xe2\x80\x99s actions violate the Fourth Amendment \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0; the issue is not his state of mind, but the objective effect of his actions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Whren</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a>, 813 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U.

S. 32</a>, 46 (2000) (emphasis added); see also <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Wells,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/1/index.html">495 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1990) (an inventory search must be regulated by \xe2\x80\x9cstandardized criteria\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cestablished routine\xe2\x80\x9d so as not to \xe2\x80\x9cbe a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).  But this inquiry is directed at ensuring that the purpose behind the <em>program</em> is not \xe2\x80\x9cultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edmond, </em>531 U. S., at 44.  It has nothing to do with discerning what is in the mind of the individual officer conducting the search.  <em>Id.,</em> at 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents further contend that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the officers\xe2\x80\x99 intrusion into the home.  They rely on <em>Welsh</em> v. <em>Wisconsin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/740/index.html">466 U. S. 740</a>, 753 (1984), in which we held that \xe2\x80\x9can important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made.\xe2\x80\x9d  This contention, too, is misplaced.  <em>Welsh</em> involved a warrantless entry by officers to arrest a suspect for driving while intoxicated.  There, the \xe2\x80\x9conly potential emergency\xe2\x80\x9d confronting the officers was the need to preserve evidence (<em>i.e.</em>, the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s blood-alcohol level)\xe2\x80\x94an exigency that we held insufficient under the circumstances to justify entry into the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s home.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Here, the officers were confronted with <em>ongoing</em> violence occurring <em>within</em> the home.  <em>Welsh</em> did not address such a situation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry here was plainly reasonable under the circumstances.  The officers were responding, at 3 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, to complaints about a loud party.  As they approached the house, they could hear from within \xe2\x80\x9can altercation occurring, some kind of a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was loud and it was tumultuous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 33.  The officers heard \xe2\x80\x9cthumping and crashing\xe2\x80\x9d and people yelling \xe2\x80\x9cstop, stop\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cget off me.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 28, 29.  As the trial court found, \xe2\x80\x9cit was obvious that \xe2\x80\xa6 knocking on the front door\xe2\x80\x9d would have been futile.  <em>Id., </em>at 92.  The noise seemed to be coming from the back of the house; after looking in the front window and seeing nothing, the officers proceeded around back to investigate further.  They found two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard.  From there, they could see that a fracas was taking place inside the kitchen.  A juvenile, fists clenched, was being held back by several adults.  As the officers watch, he breaks free and strikes one of the adults in the face, sending the adult to the sink spitting blood.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these circumstances, the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning.  Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until another blow rendered someone \xe2\x80\x9cunconscious\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csemi-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d or worse before entering.  The role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties; an officer is not like a boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it becomes too one-sided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The manner of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry was also reasonable.  After witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the screen door and \xe2\x80\x9cyelled in police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 40.  When nobody heard him, he stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again.  Only then did the tumult subside.  The officer\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of his presence was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door.  Indeed, it was probably the only option that had even a chance of rising above the din.  Under these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s knock-and-announce rule.  Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to require them to stand dumbly at the door awaiting a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their presence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962099">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nBRIGHAM CITY V.

The charges that have been pending against respondents for the past six years are minor offenses\xe2\x80\x94intoxication, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and disorderly conduct\xe2\x80\x94two of which could have been proved by evidence that was gathered by the responding officers before they entered the home.  The maximum punishment for these crimes ranges between 90 days and 6 months in jail.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous opinion restating well-settled rules of federal law is so clearly persuasive that it is hard to imagine the outcome was ever in doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under these circumstances, the only difficult question is which of the following is the most peculiar: (1) that the Utah trial judge, the intermediate state appellate court, and the Utah Supreme Court all found a Fourth Amendment violation on these facts; (2) that the prosecution chose to pursue this matter all the way to the United States Supreme Court; or (3) that this Court voted to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A possible explanation for the first is that the suppression ruling was correct as a matter of Utah law, and neither trial counsel nor the trial judge bothered to identify the Utah Constitution as an independent basis for the decision because they did not expect the prosecution to appeal.*<footcall num="*">  The most plausible explanation for the latter two decisions is that they were made so police officers in Utah may enter a home without a warrant when they see ongoing violence\xe2\x80\x94we are, of course, reversing the Utah Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the contrary.  But that purpose, laudable though it may be, cannot be achieved in this case.  Our holding today addresses only the limitations placed by the Federal Constitution on the search at issue; we have no authority to decide whether the police in this case violated the Utah Constitution.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Utah Supreme Court, however, has made clear that the Utah Constitution provides greater protection to the privacy of the home than does the Fourth Amendment.  See <em>State </em>v. <em>Debooy</em>, 2000 UT 32, \xc2\xb612, 996 P.\xc2\xa02d 546, 549.  And it complained in this case of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 failure to raise or adequately brief a state constitutional challenge, thus preventing the state courts from deciding the case on anything other than Fourth Amendment grounds.  See 2005 UT 13, \xc2\xb612, 122 P.\xc2\xa03d 506, 510.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]urpris[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he reluctance of litigants to take up and develop a state constitutional analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the court expressly invited future litigants to bring challenges under the Utah Constitution to enable it to fulfill its \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibility as guardians of the individual liberty of our citizens\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[e] a principled exploration of the interplay between federal and state protections of individual rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 511.  The fact that this admonishment and request came from the Utah Supreme Court in this very case not only demonstrates that the prosecution selected the wrong case for establishing the rule it wants, but indicates that the Utah Supreme Court would probably adopt the same rule as a matter of state constitutional law that we reject today under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether or not that forecast is accurate, I can see no reason for this Court to cause the Utah courts to redecide the question as a matter of state law.  Federal interests are not offended when a single State elects to provide greater protection for its citizens than the Federal Constitution requires.  Indeed, I continue to believe \xe2\x80\x9cthat a policy of judicial restraint\xe2\x80\x94one that allows other decisional bodies to have the last word in legal interpretation until it is truly necessary for this Court to intervene\xe2\x80\x94enables this Court to make its most effective contribution to our federal system of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1067 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, while I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I remain persuaded that my vote to deny the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari was correct.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Indeed, it was the prosecution that prepared the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order granting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to suppress.
