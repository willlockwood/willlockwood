Appellant argues that this selection procedure permits the jury commissioners to know the race, sex, and approximate age of every juror before the venire is selected, and that as a consequence, a clear and ready opportunity for discrimination inheres in the selection procedure.

The State, 230 Ga. 327, 331, 196 S.E. 2d 849, 853 (1973).</p></ul> <p> Although a defendant in a criminal case does not have a constitutional right to grand and petit jury arrays that represent the community in exact, mathematical proportions, the selection procedure employed must provide \'a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross section of the community.\' Williams v. Florida, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/78/case.html#100">399 U.S. 78, 100</a> (1970). \'[A] State cannot, consistent with due process, subject a defendant to indictment or trial by a jury that has been selected in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States.\' Peters v. Kiff, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/493/case.html#502">407 U.S. 493, 502</a> (1972). (Opinion of Marshall, J.) </p><p> Appellant\'s challenge to the racial composition of the venire appears to me to require application of the principles that guided our judgment in Alexander v. Louisiana, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/625/case.html">405 U.S. 625</a> (1972). In Alexander petitioner introduced statistical evidence that blacks comprised 21.06% of the population, but only 6.75% of the grand jury panels, demonstrating an underrepresentation of 67.9%. In addition, petitioner introduced evidence that the jury commissioners used information cards which designated the race of each potential juror. We held that petitioner\'s statistical evidence establishing that blacks were underrepresented, together with the evidence that the selection procedures themselves were not racially neutral, established a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination, and thus shifted the burden of proof to the State \'to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral se- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="889">Page 414 U.S. 886 , 889</a></p><p> lection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result. Turner v. Fouche, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/346/case.html#361">396 U.S. 346, 361</a> (1970); Eubanks v. Louisiana, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/584/case.html#587">356 U.S. 584, 587</a> (1958). \' Since the State failed to meet its burden of proof, we set aside Alexander\'s conviction. </p><p> Similarly, appellant\'s statistics here demonstrate substantial underrepresentation of blacks on the grand and petit jury venire, 49.7% and 61.7% respectively. Furthermore, there inheres in the selection procedures employed by the Coweta County jury commissioners the same fatal defect we found in the procedures employed in Alexander, i. e., the procedures assure that the jury commissioner shall learn the race of every potential juror before the list is compiled. See Avery v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/559/case.html">345 U.S. 559</a> (1953); Whitus v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/545/case.html">385 U.S. 545</a> (1967). Thus, appellant in this case also seems to have established a prima facie case of racial discrimination, that under Alexander shifted to the State burden of proof to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action. Under Alexander also, the State\'s evidence in the form of the testimony of the jury commissioners that they made no conscious effort to exclude anyone on the basis of race, sex, or age, would not appear to suffice to rebut the presumption. For in Alexander we held that \'affirmations of good faith in making individual selections are insufficient to dispel a prima facie case of systematic exclusion. Turner v. Fouche, supra, at 361; Jones v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/24/case.html#25">389 U.S. 24, 25</a> (1967); Sims v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/404/case.html#407">389 U.S. 404, 407</a> (1967).\' </p><p> Appellant also contends that women and young adults age 18 30 were systematically and purposefully excluded from the venire from which the grand and petit jury lists were compiled. The statistical evidence indicates that women were underrepresented by 91.6% on the grand jury list, and 70.6% on the petit jury list. Young </p><p><a class="page-number" name="890">Page 414 U.S. 886 , 890</a></p><p> adults were underrepresented by 95.2% on the grand jury list, and 88.2% on the petit jury list. Though Alexander involved racial discrimination, appellant\'s contention certainly presents a substantial question whether the principles of that decision should apply where any large, identifiable segment of the community is arbitrarily or discriminatorily underrepresented on the jury venire. Therefore, I would set this case for oral argument to consider both appellant\'s racial claims and his claims that selection procedure which enables jury commissioners to know the sex and approximate age of potential jurors also constitute a prima facie case of sex or age discrimination. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] \'Does systematic, intentional and discriminatory exclusion of Negroes, women and young adults age 18 to 30, from jury service, violate Appellant\'s rights of Due Process and Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and does disproportionate under representation of these groups in the jury pools constitute a prima facie case of discrimination?\' </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
