MARSHALL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">STERN, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL <em>v</em>. MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF MARSHALL</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 10\xe2\x80\x93179.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 18, 2011\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 23, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">Article III, \xc2\xa71, of the Constitution mandates that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,\xe2\x80\x9d and provides that the judges of those constitutional courts \xe2\x80\x9cshall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creceive for their Services[\xc2\xa0] a Compensation[\xc2\xa0] [that] shall not be diminished\xe2\x80\x9d during their tenure.  The questions presented in this case are whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157 and Article III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s father, approximately a year before his death.  Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J. Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tortiously interfered with that gift.  After J. Howard died, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in federal court.  Pierce filed a proof of claim in that proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in controlling his father\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of dollars in damages on her counterclaim.  Pierce objected that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on that counterclaim because it was not a \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C).  As set forth in \xc2\xa7157(a), Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] under title 11\xe2\x80\x9d; those that \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] in\xe2\x80\x9d a Title 11 case; and those that are \xe2\x80\x9crelated to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  District courts may refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district, and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in \xe2\x80\x9call core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7157(a), (b)(1).  In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy judge may only \xe2\x80\x9csubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).  Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 categories of core proceedings, including \xe2\x80\x9ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim was a core proceeding.  The District Court reversed, reading this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent in <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/index.html">458 U. S. 50</a>, to \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[\xc2\xa0] that it would be unconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court held that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat related to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as proposed, not final.  Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the District Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed.  It held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim because the claim was not \xe2\x80\x9cso closely related to [Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because that holding made the Texas probate court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment the earliest final judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclusive effect.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter final judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim as a core proceeding under \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C).  Pierce argues that \xc2\xa7157(b) authorizes bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 itself.  But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of core proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under bankruptcy law, and the structure of \xc2\xa7157 makes clear that no such category exists.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim because his defamation claim is a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal injury tort\xe2\x80\x9d that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to hear under \xc2\xa7157(b)(5).  The Court agrees with Vickie that \xc2\xa7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the defamation claim.  The Court is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such.  See generally <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>Shinseki</em>, 562 U. S. ___; <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>.  Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree, and the statutory context belies Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it is jurisdictional.  Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the defamation claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to litigate his claim there.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Although \xc2\xa7157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Article III is \xe2\x80\x9can inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cboth defines the power and protects the independence of the Judicial Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion).  Article III protects liberty not only through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but also by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to protect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III challenge to a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  In <em>Northern Pipeline,</em> the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\xe2\x80\x94who also lacked the tenure and salary guarantees of Article III\xe2\x80\x94could \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\xe2\x80\x9d against an entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.  <em>Id.,</em> at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion).  The plurality in <em>Northern Pipeline </em>recognized that there was a category of cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress could constitutionally assign to \xe2\x80\x9clegislative\xe2\x80\x9d courts for resolution.  A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and rejected the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was acting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.  <em>Id.,</em> at 69\xe2\x80\x9372; see <em>id.,</em> at 90\xe2\x80\x9391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  After the decision in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, Congress revised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.  With respect to the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings listed in \xc2\xa7157(b)(2), however, the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded under the 1978 Act.  The authority exercised by the newly constituted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s exceeds the bounds of Article III.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim does not fall within the public rights exception, however defined.  The Court has long recognized that, in general, Congress may not \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 284.  The Court has also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights, \xe2\x80\xa6 which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Several previous decisions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights exception\xe2\x80\x94those arising \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and those that are instead matters \xe2\x80\x9cof private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a>, 50, 51.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, the Court rejected the limitation of the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a party.  The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  In other words, it is still the case that what makes a right \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d rather than private is that the right is integrally related to particular Federal Government action.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>, 564 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311); <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/568/index.html">473 U. S. 568</a>, 584; <em>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</em> v. <em>Schor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/833/index.html">478 U. S. 833</a>, 844, 856.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/33/index.html">492 U. S. 33</a>, the most recent case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a bankruptcy trustee\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception.  Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim is similar.  It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches, as in <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284; it does not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in <em>Thomas</em>, 473 U. S., at 584\xe2\x80\x93585; and it is not \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely dependent upon\xe2\x80\x9d adjudication of a claim created by federal law, as in <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 856.  This case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment <em>by a court</em> with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.  If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right,\xe2\x80\x9d then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recognized into mere wishful thinking.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adjudicate Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  Initially, Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s defamation claim does not affect the nature of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference counterclaim as one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x94the type of claim that, under <em>Northern Pipeline </em>and <em>Granfinanciera</em>,<em> </em>must be decided by an Article III court.  The cases on which Vickie relies, <em>Katchen</em> v. <em>Landy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/323/index.html">382 U. S. 323</a>, and <em>Langenkamp</em> v. <em>Culp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/42/index.html">498 U. S. 42</a> (<em>per curiam</em>), are inapposite.  <em>Katchen</em> permitted a bankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s voidable preference claim against a creditor only where there was no question that the referee was required to decide whether there had been a voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to allow the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The <em>Katchen </em>Court \xe2\x80\x9cintimate[d] no opinion concerning whether\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy referee would have had \xe2\x80\x9csummary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the [creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proof of\xc2\xa0] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  382 U. S., at 333, n.\xc2\xa09.  The <em>per curiam</em> opinion in <em>Langenkamp</em> is to the same effect.  In this case, by contrast, the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x94in order to resolve Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim\xe2\x80\x94was required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not \xe2\x80\x9cdisposed of in passing on objections\xe2\x80\x9d to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim.  In both <em>Katchen </em>and <em>Langenkamp</em>, moreover, the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.  Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim is instead a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.  Pp. 29\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not \xe2\x80\x9cadjuncts\xe2\x80\x9d of the district courts.  The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts considered in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, do not \xe2\x80\x9cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law\xe2\x80\x9d or engage in \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).  Whereas the adjunct agency in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson</em> \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders \xe2\x80\xa6 [that] could be enforced only by order of the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate orders and judgments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including final judgments\xe2\x80\x94subject to review only if a party chooses to appeal, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7157(b)(1), 158(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Such a court is an adjunct of no one.  Pp. 34\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Finally, Vickie and her <em>amici</em> predict that restrictions on a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional costs on the bankruptcy process.  It goes without saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Chadha</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/index.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 944.  In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical consequences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests.  The framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by state courts and district courts, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7157(c), 1334(c), and the Court does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the statute.

Innumerable children have been born into the cause: innumerable young people have married into it;\xe2\x80\x9d and, sadly, the original parties \xe2\x80\x9chave died out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9clong procession of [judges] has come in and gone out\xe2\x80\x9d dur-ing that time, and still the suit \xe2\x80\x9cdrags its weary length before the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those words were not written about this case, see C.\xc2\xa0Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens 4\xe2\x80\x935 (1891), but they could have been.  This is the second time we have had occasion to weigh in on this long-running dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II, a man believed to have been one of the richest people in Texas.  The Marshalls\xe2\x80\x99 litigation has worked its way through state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and California, and two of those courts\xe2\x80\x94a Texas state probate court and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District\nof California\xe2\x80\x94have reached contrary decisions on its mer-its.  The Court of Appeals below held that the Texas state decision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a counterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her bankruptcy proceeding.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  To determine whether the Court of Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two issues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b) to issue a final judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the history of this litigation is complicated, its resolution ultimately turns on very basic principles.  Article III, \xc2\xa71, of the Constitution commands that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\xe2\x80\x9d  That Article further provides that the judges of those courts shall hold their offices during good behavior, without diminution of salary.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Those requirements of Article III were not honored here.  The Bankruptcy Court in this case exercised the judicial power of the United States by entering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even though the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure during good behavior nor salary protection.  We conclude that, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we have already recounted the facts and procedural history of this case in detail, see <em>Marshall</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/293/index.html">547 U. S. 293</a>, 300\xe2\x80\x93305 (2006), we do not repeat them in full here.  Of current relevance are two claims Vickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s fortune.  Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith, Vickie was J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s third wife and married him about a year before his death.  <em>Id.,</em> at 300; see <em>In re</em> <em>Marshall</em>, 392 F.\xc2\xa03d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004).  Although J. Howard bestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during their courtship and marriage, he did not include her in\nhis will.  547 U. S., at 300.  Before J. Howard passed away, Vickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting that Pierce\xe2\x80\x94J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s younger son\xe2\x80\x94fraudulently induced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include her, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his property.  Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and defended the validity of J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s trust and, eventually, his will.  392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1122\xe2\x80\x931123, 1125.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s death, Vickie filed a petition for bankruptcy in the Central District of California.  Pierce filed a complaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell members of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain control of his father\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  547 U. S., at 300\xe2\x80\x93301; <em>In re</em> <em>Marshall</em>, 600 F.\xc2\xa03d 1037, 1043\xe2\x80\x931044 (CA9 2010).  The complaint sought a declaration that Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s defamation claim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceedings.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a).  Pierce subsequently filed a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning that he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate.  See \xc2\xa7501(a).  Vickie responded to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to the alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.  As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that Pierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking the legal steps necessary to provide her with half his property.  547 U. S., at 301.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued\nan order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim for defamation.  On September 27, 2000, after a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment\non Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim in her favor.  The court later awarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages.  600 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1045; see 253 B.\xc2\xa0R. 550, 561\xe2\x80\x93562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000); 257 B.\xc2\xa0R. 35, 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made earlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority over the counterclaim was limited because Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim was not a \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C).  See 257 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 39.  As explained below, bankruptcy courts may hear and en-\nter final judgments in \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d in a bankruptcy case.  In non-core proceedings, the bankruptcy courts instead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, for that court\xe2\x80\x99s review and issuance of final judgment.  The Bankruptcy Court in this case concluded that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim was \xe2\x80\x9ca core proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cpower to enter judgment\xe2\x80\x9d on the counterclaim under \xc2\xa7157(b)(1).  <em>Id.</em>, at 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court disagreed.  It recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cVickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within the literal language\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute designating certain proceedings as \xe2\x80\x9ccore,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C), but understood this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent to \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[\xc2\xa0] that it would be unconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\xe2\x80\x9d  264 B.\xc2\xa0R. 609, 629\xe2\x80\x93630 (CD Cal. 2001) (citing <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/50/index.html">458 U. S. 50</a>, 79, n. 31 (1982) (plurality opinion)).  The District Court accordingly concluded that a \xe2\x80\x9ccounterclaim should not be characterized as core\xe2\x80\x9d when it \xe2\x80\x9cis only somewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted, and when the unique characteristics and context of the counterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off or other counterclaims that customarily arise.\xe2\x80\x9d  264 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 632.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the District Court concluded that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim was not core, the court determined that it was required to treat the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as \xe2\x80\x9cproposed[,] rather than final,\xe2\x80\x9d and engage in an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent review\xe2\x80\x9d of the record.  <em>Id.,</em> at 633; see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).  Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the District Court declined to give that judgment preclusive effect and went on to decide the matter itself.  271 B.\xc2\xa0R. 858, 862\xe2\x80\x93867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275 B.\xc2\xa0R. 5, 56\xe2\x80\x9358 (CD Cal. 2002).  Like the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court found that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s expectancy of a gift from J. Howard.  The District Court awarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each in the amount of $44,292,767.33.  <em>Id.,</em> at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on a different ground, 392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1137, and we\xe2\x80\x94in the first visit of the case to this Court\xe2\x80\x94reversed the Court of Appeals on that issue.  547 U. S., at 314\xe2\x80\x93315.  On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals held that \xc2\xa7157 mandated \xe2\x80\x9ca two-step approach\xe2\x80\x9d under which a bankruptcy judge may issue a final judgment in a proceeding only\nif the matter both \xe2\x80\x9cmeets Congress\xe2\x80\x99 definition of a core proceeding <em>and</em> arises under or arises in title 11,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Code.  600 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1055.  The court also reasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final judgments on all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cwould certainly run afoul\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>.  600 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1057.  With those concerns in mind, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ca counterclaim under \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C) is properly a \xe2\x80\x98core\xe2\x80\x99 proceeding \xe2\x80\x98arising in a case under\xe2\x80\x99 the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the counterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted; second brackets added).  The court ruled that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim did not meet that test.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1059.  That holding made \xe2\x80\x9cthe Texas probate court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 the earliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court should have \xe2\x80\x9cafford[ed] preclusive effect\xe2\x80\x9d to the Texas \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x99s determination of relevant legal and factual issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1064\xe2\x80\x931065.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We again granted certiorari.  561 U.

We have not directly addressed the question, however, and Pierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment on a core proceeding only if that proceeding also \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] in\xe2\x80\x9d a Title 11 case or \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] under\xe2\x80\x9d Title 11 itself.  Brief for Respondent 51 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy courts to \xe2\x80\x9chear and determine all cases under title 11 and all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  As written, \xc2\xa7157(b)(1) is ambiguous.  The \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9carising in\xe2\x80\x9d phrases might, as Pierce suggests, be read as referring to a limited category of those core proceedings that are addressed in that section.  On the other hand, the phrases might be read as simply describing what core proceedings are: matters arising under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case.  In this case the structure and context of \xc2\xa7157 contradict Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7157(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute necessarily assumes that there is a category of core proceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a Title 11 case.  The manner in which the statute delineates the bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority, however, makes plain that no such category exists.  Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to instead submit proposed findings in \xe2\x80\x9ca proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nowhere does \xc2\xa7157 specify what bankruptcy courts are to do with respect to the category of matters that Pierce posits\xe2\x80\x94core proceedings that do <em>not</em> arise under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case.  To the contrary, \xc2\xa7157(b)(3) only instructs a bankruptcy judge to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine, on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s own motion or on timely motion of a party, whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under this subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related to a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two options.  The statute does not suggest that any other distinctions need be made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our reading of the statute, core proceedings are those that arise in a bankruptcy case or under Title 11.  The detailed list of core proceedings in \xc2\xa7157(b)(2) pro-\nvides courts with ready examples of such matters.  Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7157, in contrast, supposes that some core pro-ceedings will arise in a Title 11 case or under Title 11\nand some will not.  Under that reading, the statute provides no guidance on how to tell which are which.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it significant that Congress failed to provide any framework for identifying or adjudicating the asserted category of core but not \xe2\x80\x9carising\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings, given the otherwise detailed provisions governing bankruptcy court authority.  It is hard to believe that Congress would go to the trouble of cataloging 16 different types of proceedings that should receive \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d treatment, but then fail to specify how to determine whether those matters arise under Title 11 or in a bankruptcy case if\xe2\x80\x94as Pierce asserts\xe2\x80\x94the latter inquiry is determinative of the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pierce argues that we should treat core matters that arise neither under Title 11 nor in a Title 11 case as proceedings \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d a Title 11 case.  Brief for Respondent 60 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We think that a contradiction in terms.  It does not make sense to describe a \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy proceeding as merely \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy case; oxymoron is not a typical feature of congressional drafting.

Core proceedings are, at most, those that arise in title 11 cases or arise under title 11\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  And, as already discussed, the statute simply does not provide for a proceeding that is simultaneously core and yet only related to the bankruptcy case.

Pierce is also correct that we will, where possible, construe federal statutes so as \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Commod-ity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Schor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/833/index.html">478 U.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16\xe2\x80\x9317, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Deputy Solicitor General) (Section \xe2\x80\x9c157(b)(5) is in [the United States\xe2\x80\x99] view not jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the limited scope of that provision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or for-feit any objections under \xc2\xa7157(b)(5), in the same way that a party may waive or forfeit an objection to the bankruptcy court finally resolving a non-core claim.

Vickie asserts that in this case Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of his defamation claim, and forfeited any argument to the contrary, by failing to seek withdrawal of the claim until he had litigated it before the Bankruptcy Court for 27 months.  <em>Id.,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9323.  On the merits, Vickie contends that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal injury tort and wrongful death<em> </em>claims\xe2\x80\x9d does not include non-physical torts such as defamation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not determine what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal injury tort\xe2\x80\x9d in this case because we agree with Vickie that \xc2\xa7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of his defamation claim.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[b]randing a rule as going to a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>Shinseki</em>, 562 U.

To begin, the statutory text does not refer to either district court or bankruptcy court \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d instead addressing only where personal injury tort claims \xe2\x80\x9cshall be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory context also belies Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional claim.  Section 157 allocates the authority to enter final judgment between the bankruptcy court and the district court.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7157(b)(1), (c)(1).  That allocation does not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction.  See \xc2\xa7157(c)(2) (parties may consent to entry of final judgment by bankruptcy judge in non-core case).   By the same token, \xc2\xa7157(b)(5) simply specifies where a particular category of cases should be tried.  Pierce does not explain why that statutory limitation may not be similarly waived.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only could but did consent to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of his defamation claim.  Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie objected to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim for defamation, arguing that Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim was unenforceable and that Pierce should not receive any amount for it.  See 29 Court of Appeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031, 6035 (hereinafter Supplemental Record).  Vickie also noted\nthat the Bankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objection, given the litigation posture of Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim before the Bankruptcy Court.  See <em>id.,</em> at 6031.  Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s filing prompted Pierce to advise the Bankruptcy Court that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll parties are in agreement that the amount of the contingent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce] shall be determined by the adversary proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d that had been commenced in the Bankruptcy Court.  31 Supplemental Record 6801.  Pierce asserted that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s objection should be overruled or, alternatively, that any ruling on the objection \xe2\x80\x9cshould be continued until the resolution of the pending adversary proceeding litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> Pierce identifies no point in the record where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that it lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim because the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court that \xc2\xa7157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from resolving his defamation claim until over two years\xe2\x80\x94and several adverse discovery rulings\xe2\x80\x94after he filed that claim in June 1996.  The first filing Pierce cites as rais-\ning that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the District Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the Bankruptcy Court.  See Brief for Respondent 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The District Court did initially withdraw the reference as requested, but it then returned the proceeding to the Bankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce \xe2\x80\x9cimplicated the jurisdiction of that bankruptcy court.  He chose to be a party to that litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.\xc2\xa0129.  Although Pierce had objected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction over Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, he advised the court at that time that he was \xe2\x80\x9chappy to litigate [his] claim\xe2\x80\x9d there.  29 Supplemental Record 6101.  Counsel stated that even though Pierce thought it was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably cheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim] were sent back or joined back with the State Court litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierce \xe2\x80\x9cdid choose\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Court forum and \xe2\x80\x9cwould be more than pleased to do it [t]here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 6101\xe2\x80\x936102; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n.\xc2\xa017 (District Court referring to these statements).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy Court, we conclude that he consented to that court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument to the contrary).

If Pierce believed that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to decide his claim for defamation, then he should have said so\xe2\x80\x94and said so promptly.

Those limitations serve two related purposes.  \xe2\x80\x9cSeparation-of-powers principles are intended, in part, to protect each branch of government from incursion by the others.  Yet the dynamic between and among the branches is not the only object of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s concern.

The colonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand of the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons why: because the King of Great Britain \xe2\x80\x9cmade Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Declaration of Independence \xc2\xb611.  The Framers undertook in Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial power of the new Federal Government from a repeat of those abuses.  By appointing judges to serve without term limits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to remove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers sought to ensure that each judicial decision would be rendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with Congress or the Executive, but rather with the \xe2\x80\x9c[c]lear heads \xe2\x80\xa6 and honest hearts\xe2\x80\x9d deemed \xe2\x80\x9cessential to good judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J.

That is why we have long recognized that, in general, Congress may not \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).

In the 1984 Act, Congress provided that the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be appointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which their districts are located.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7152(a).  And, as we have explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings.  See<em> supra,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to such \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d matters, however, the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same powers they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978 Act), 92 Stat. 2549.  As in <em>Northern Pipeline,</em> for example, the newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged under \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C) with resolving \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the law to which\xe2\x80\x9d a counterclaim may lead.  458 U.

As in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, the new courts in core proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cissue final judgments, which are binding and enforceable even in the absence of an appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U.

And, as in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, the district courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy courts in core proceedings only under the usual limited appellate standards.  That requires marked deference to, among other things, the bankruptcy judges\xe2\x80\x99 findings of fact.  See \xc2\xa7158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy.

We disagree.  It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this case exercised the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in purporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state common law claim, just as the court did in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>.  No \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right\xe2\x80\x9d exception excuses the failure to comply with Article III in doing so, any more than in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>.  Vickie argues that this case is different because the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy.  But the debtors\xe2\x80\x99 claims in the cases on which she relies were themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law, which would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy process of allowing or disallowing claims.  Here Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim is a state law action independent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling on the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim in bankruptcy.  <em>Northern Pipeline</em> and our subsequent decision in <em>Granfinanciera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/33/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/33/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/33/index.html">492 U.

As explained above, in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> we rejected the argument that the public rights doctrine permitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law suit brought by a debtor against a company that had not filed a claim against the estate.

That case involved the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s sale of property belonging to a customs collector who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal Government that he had collected on its behalf.  <em>Id.,</em> at 274, 275.  The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land through a different transfer, objected that the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the property was void, because it was a judicial act that could not be assigned to the Executive under Article III.  <em>Id.,</em> at 274\xe2\x80\x93275, 282\xe2\x80\x93283.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court laid out the principles guiding its analysis.  <em>Id.,</em> at 284.  It confirmed that Congress cannot \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an example of such matters, the Court referred to \xe2\x80\x9c[e]quitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded territories\xe2\x80\x9d and cited cases in which land issues were conclusively resolved by Executive Branch officials.  <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Foley</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, 15 How. 433 (1854); <em>Burgess</em> v. <em>Gray</em>, 16 How. 48 (1854)).  In those cases \xe2\x80\x9cit depends upon the will of congress whether a remedy in the courts shall be allowed at all,\xe2\x80\x9d so Congress could limit the extent to which a judicial forum was available.  <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284.  The challenge in <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s</em> <em>Lessee</em> to the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s sale of the collector\xe2\x80\x99s land likewise fell within the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d category of cases, because it could only be brought if the Federal Government chose to allow it by waiving sovereign immunity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 283\xe2\x80\x93284.<em> </em> The point of <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> was simply that Congress may set the terms of adjudicating a suit when the suit could not otherwise proceed at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequent decisions from this Court contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights exception\xe2\x80\x94those arising \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and those that were instead matters \xe2\x80\x9cof private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U.

The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert government agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  In other words, it is still the case that what makes a right \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d rather than private is that the right is integrally related to particular federal government action.

A customer filed such a claim to recover a debit balance in his account, while the broker filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court to recover the same amount as lawfully due from the customer.  The broker later submitted its claim to the CFTC, but after that agency ruled against the customer, the customer argued that agency jurisdiction over the broker\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim violated Article III.  <em>Id.,</em> at 837\xe2\x80\x93838.

Most significantly, given that the customer\xe2\x80\x99s reparations claim before the agency and the broker\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim were competing claims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly emphasized that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to allow the agency to exercise jurisdiction over the broker\xe2\x80\x99s claim, or else \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nreparations procedure would have been confounded.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n<em>Id.,</em> at 856.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most recent case in which we considered application of the public rights exception\xe2\x80\x94and the only case in which we have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy context since <em>Northern Pipeline</em>\xe2\x80\x94is <em>Granfinanciera, S.

In <em>Granfinanciera </em>we rejected a bankruptcy trustee\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding fell within the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  We explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact, and if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the Federal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an Article III court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  We reasoned that fraudulent conveyance suits were \xe2\x80\x9cquintessentially suits at common law that more nearly resemble state law contract claims brought by a bankrupt corporation to augment the bankruptcy estate than they do creditors\xe2\x80\x99 hierarchically ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 56.  As a consequence, we concluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were \xe2\x80\x9cmore accurately characterized as a private rather than a public right as we have used those terms in our Article III decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 55.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim\xe2\x80\x94like the fraudulent conveyance claim at issue in <em>Granfinanciera</em>\xe2\x80\x94does not fall within any of the varied formulations of the public rights exception in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases.  It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches, as in <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284, or one that \xe2\x80\x9chistorically could have been determined exclusively by\xe2\x80\x9d those branches, <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 68 (citing <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp.</em>, 279 U. S., at 458).  The claim is instead one under state common law between two private parties.  It does not \xe2\x80\x9cdepend[\xc2\xa0] on the will of congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 284; Congress has nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claimed right to relief does not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in <em>Thomas</em>, 473 U. S., at 584\xe2\x80\x93585, or <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U. S., at 458.  It is not \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely dependent upon\xe2\x80\x9d adjudication of a claim created by federal law, as in <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 856.  And in contrast to the objecting party in <em>Schor</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 855\xe2\x80\x93856, Pierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim in the bankruptcy court proceedings.  He had nowhere else to go if he wished to recover from Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s estate.  See <em>Granfinanciera</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 59, n.\xc2\xa014 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]arallel reasoning [to <em>Schor</em>] is unavailable in the context of bankruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not limited to a \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized area of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d\nas in <em>Crowell</em>, <em>Thomas</em>, and <em>Schor</em>.  <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).  We deal here not with an agency but with a court, with substantive jurisdiction reaching any area of the <em>corpus juris</em>.  See <em>ibid.</em>; <em>id.,</em> at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  This is not a situation in which Congress devised an \xe2\x80\x9cexpert and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are particularly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U. S., at 46; see <em>Schor</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 855\xe2\x80\x93856.  The \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d in the federal system at resolving common law counterclaims such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s are the Article III courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must stay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent reads our cases differently, and in particular contends that more recent cases view <em>Northern Pipeline</em> as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 6 (quoting <em>Thomas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 584).  Just so: Substitute \xe2\x80\x9ctort\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ccontract,\xe2\x80\x9d and that statement directly covers this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that there may be instances in which the distinction between public and private rights\xe2\x80\x94at least as framed by some of our recent cases\xe2\x80\x94fails to provide concrete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular agency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive regulatory scheme.  Given the extent to which this case is so markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the public rights exception in the context of such a regime, however, we do not in this opinion express any view on how the doctrine might apply in that different context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is plain here is that this case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment <em>by a court</em> with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.  If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right,\xe2\x80\x9d then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers we have long recognized into mere wishful thinking.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish <em>Northern Pipeline</em> and <em>Granfinanciera </em>on the ground that Pierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings.  Given Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues, the Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her counterclaim under our decisions in <em>Katchen</em> v. <em>Landy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/323/index.html">382 U. S. 323</a> (1966), and <em>Langenkamp</em> v. <em>Culp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/42/index.html">498 U. S. 42</a> (1990) (<em>per curiam</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not agree.  As an initial matter, it is hard to see why Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s decision to file a claim should make any difference with respect to the characterization of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[P]roperty interests are created and defined by state law,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98[u]nless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America</em> v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/443/index.html">549 U. S. 443</a>, 451 (2007) (quoting <em>Butner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/48/index.html">440 U. S. 48</a>, 55 (1979)).  Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim for defamation in no way affects the nature of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim for tortious interference as one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x94the very type of claim that we held in <em>Northern Pipeline </em>and <em>Granfinanciera </em>must be decided by an Article III court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s contention, moreover, our decisions in <em>Katchen </em>and <em>Langenkamp </em>do not suggest a different result.  <em>Katchen</em> permitted a bankruptcy referee acting under the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to a bankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as \xe2\x80\x9csummary jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over a voidable preference claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who had filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.  See 382 U. S., at 325, 327\xe2\x80\x93328.  A voidable preference claim asserts that a debtor made a payment to a particular creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect increase that creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proportionate share of the estate.  The preferred creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim in bankruptcy can be disallowed as a result of the preference, and the amounts paid to that creditor can be recovered by the trustee.  See <em>id.,</em> at 330; see also 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(d), 547(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the creditor in <em>Katchen</em> objected that the preference issue should be resolved through a \xe2\x80\x9cplenary suit\xe2\x80\x9d in an Article III court, this Court concluded that summary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate, because it was not possible for the referee to rule on the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim without first resolving the voidable preference issue.  382 U. S., at 329\xe2\x80\x93330, 332\xe2\x80\x93333, and n.\xc2\xa09, 334.  There was no question that the bankruptcy referee could decide whether there had been a voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent\nto allow the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Once the referee did that, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit\xe2\x80\x9d; such a suit \xe2\x80\x9cwould be a meaningless gesture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 334.  The plenary proceeding the creditor sought could be brought into the bankruptcy court because \xe2\x80\x9cthe same issue [arose] as part of the process of allowance and disallowance of claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was in that sense that the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9che who invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the consequences of that procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 333, n.\xc2\xa09.  In <em>Katchen</em> one of those consequences was resolution of the preference issue as part of the process of allowing or disallowing claims, and accordingly there was no basis for the creditor to insist that the issue be resolved in an Article III court.  See <em>id.,</em> at 334.  Indeed, the <em>Katchen </em>Court expressly noted that it \xe2\x80\x9cintimate[d] no opinion concerning whether\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy referee would have had \xe2\x80\x9csummary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the [creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proof of] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 333, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our <em>per curiam</em> opinion in <em>Langenkamp</em> is to the same effect.  We explained there that a preferential transfer claim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly favored creditor has filed a claim, because <em>then</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthe ensuing preference action by the trustee become[s] integral to the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U. S., at 44.  If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a proof of claim, the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s preference action does <em>not</em> \xe2\x80\x9cbecome[\xc2\xa0] part of the claims-allowance process\xe2\x80\x9d subject to resolution by the bankruptcy court.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see <em>id.,</em> at 45.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In ruling on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, the Bankruptcy Court was required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not \xe2\x80\x9cdisposed of in pass-\ning on objections\xe2\x80\x9d to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim for defama-\ntion, which the court had denied almost a year earlier.  <em>Katchen</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 332, n.\xc2\xa09.  There was some overlap between Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim and Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s defamation claim that led the courts below to conclude that the counterclaim was compulsory, 600 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1057, or at least in an \xe2\x80\x9cattenuated\xe2\x80\x9d sense related to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim, 264 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 631.  But there was never any reason to believe that the process of adjudicating Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim would necessarily resolve Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  See <em>id.,</em> at 631, 632 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary facts at issue on Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim were the relationship between Vickie and her attorneys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe counterclaim raises issues of law entirely dif-ferent from those raise[d] on the defamation claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  The United States acknowledges the point.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae,</em> p.\xc2\xa0(I) (question presented concerns authority of a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a compulsory counterclaim \xe2\x80\x9cwhen adjudication of the counterclaim requires resolution of issues that are not implicated by the claim against the estate\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,\n</em>at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only overlap between the two claims in this case was the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously taken control of his father\xe2\x80\x99s estate in the manner alleged by Vickie in her counterclaim and described in the allegedly defamatory statements.  From the outset, it was clear that, even assuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it did) rule in Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s favor on that question, the court could not enter judgment for Vickie unless the court additionally ruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tortious interference with an expected gift as a valid cause of action, what the elements of that action were, and whether those elements were met in this case.  275 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 50\xe2\x80\x9353.  Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted by other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to prove, above and beyond Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference, (1) the existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable certainty that the expectancy would have been realized but for the interference; and (3) damages.  <em>Id.,</em> at 51; see 253 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 558\xe2\x80\x93561.  Also, because Vickie sought punitive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the Bankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s favor without determining whether to subject Pierce to the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cretribution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment[,] and deterrence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Exxon Shipping Co.</em>, 554 U.

There thus was never reason to \nbelieve that the process of ruling on Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of \nclaim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In both <em>Katchen </em>and <em>Langenkamp</em>, moreover, the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.  In <em>Langen-kamp</em>, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe trustee instituted adversary proceedings under 11 U.

In <em>Katchen</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Trustee \xe2\x80\xa6 [asserted] that the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences inhibited by Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum Opinion (Feb. 8, 1963), Tr. of Record in O.\xc2\xa0T. 1965, No. 28, p.\xc2\xa03; see 382 U.

(\xc2\xa760(b) of the then-applicable Bankruptcy Act) (\xe2\x80\x9cpreference may be avoided by the trustee if the creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby \xe2\x80\xa6 has, at the time when the transfer is made, reasonable cause to believe that the debtor is insolvent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim, in contrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon bankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent that there are no \xe2\x80\x9crelevant distinction[s]\xe2\x80\x9d between Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim in this case and the claim at issue in <em>Langenkamp</em>.  <em>Post</em>, at 14.  We see no reason to treat Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance action in <em>Granfinanciera</em>.  492 U.

Vickie has failed to demonstrate that her counterclaim falls within one of the \xe2\x80\x9climited circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d covered by the public rights exception, particularly given our conclusion that, \xe2\x80\x9ceven with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the \xe2\x80\x98public rights\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art.

Brief for Petitioner 61\xe2\x80\x9364.  We rejected a similar argument in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, see 458 U. S., at 84\xe2\x80\x9386 (plurality opinion); <em>id.,</em> at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds true today.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin, as explained above, it is still the bankruptcy court itself that exercises the essential attributes of judicial power over a matter such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  See <em>supra,</em> at 20.  The new bankruptcy courts, like the old, do not \xe2\x80\x9cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law\xe2\x80\x9d\nor engage in \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).  Instead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the law to which\xe2\x80\x9d the parties\xe2\x80\x99 counterclaims might lead.  <em>Id.,</em> at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, whereas the adjunct agency in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson</em> \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders \xe2\x80\xa6 [that] could be enforced only by order of the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Northern Pipeline, supra,</em> at 85, a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate orders and judgments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including final judgments\xe2\x80\x94subject to review only if a party chooses to appeal, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7157(b)(1), 158(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  It is thus no less the case here than it was in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he authority\xe2\x80\x94and the respon-sibility\xe2\x80\x94to make an informed, final determination \xe2\x80\xa6 remains with\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy judge, not the district court.  458 U. S., at 81 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given that authority, a bankruptcy court can no more be deemed a mere \xe2\x80\x9cadjunct\xe2\x80\x9d of the district court than a district court can be deemed such an \xe2\x80\x9cadjunct\xe2\x80\x9d of the court of appeals.  We certainly cannot accept the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s notion that judges who have the power to enter final, binding orders are the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9claw clerks[\xc2\xa0] and the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s administrative officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11.  And even were we wrong in this regard, that would only confirm that such judges should not be in the business of entering final judgments in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes, bankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by the Article III courts, rather than the President.  See Brief for Petitioner 59.  If\xe2\x80\x94as we have concluded\xe2\x80\x94the bankruptcy court itself exercises \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential attributes of judicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 851 (internal quotation marks omitted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy judge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in such proceedings.  The constitutional bar remains.  See The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (\xe2\x80\x9cPeriodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to [a judge\xe2\x80\x99s] necessary independence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Vickie and her <em>amici</em> predict as a practical matter that restrictions on a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional costs on the bankruptcy process.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9336, 57\xe2\x80\x9358; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>29\xe2\x80\x9330.  It goes without saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Chadha</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/index.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 944 (1983).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, we are not convinced that the practical consequences of such limitations on the authority of bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as Vickie and the dissent suggest.  See <em>post</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  The dissent asserts that it is important that counterclaims such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s be resolved \xe2\x80\x9cin a bankruptcy court,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, \xe2\x80\x9cto be effective, a single tribunal must have broad authority to restructure [debtor-creditor] relations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 14, 15 (emphasis deleted).  But the framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by judges other than those of the bankruptcy courts.  Section 1334(c)(2), for example, requires that bankruptcy courts abstain from hearing specified non-core, state law claims that \xe2\x80\x9ccan be timely adjudicated[\xc2\xa0] in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1334(c)(1) similarly provides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing any proceeding, including core matters, \xe2\x80\x9cin the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As described above, the current bankruptcy system also requires the district court to review <em>de novo</em> and enter final judgment on any matters that are \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy proceedings, \xc2\xa7157(c)(1), and permits the district court to withdraw from the bankruptcy court any referred case, proceeding, or part thereof, \xc2\xa7157(d).  Pierce has not argued that the bankruptcy courts \xe2\x80\x9care barred from \xe2\x80\x98hearing\xe2\x80\x99 all counterclaims\xe2\x80\x9d or proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law on those matters, but rather that it must be the district court that \xe2\x80\x9cfinally decide[s]\xe2\x80\x9d them.  Brief for Respondent 61.  We do not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the current statute; we agree with the United States that the question presented here is a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d one.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If our decision today does not change all that much, then why the fuss?  Is there really a threat to the separation of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial power outside Article III only over certain counterclaims in bankruptcy?  The short but emphatic answer is yes.  A statute may no more lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial Branch than it may eliminate it entirely.  \xe2\x80\x9cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/1/index.html">354 U.

Although \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form,\xe2\x80\x9d we cannot overlook the intrusion: \xe2\x80\x9cillegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boyd</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/index.html">116 U.

We conclude today that Congress, in one isolated respect, exceeded that limitation in the Bankruptcy Act of 1984.  The Bankruptcy Court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim.

Had Pierce preserved his argument under that provision, we would have been confronted with several questions on which there is little consensus or precedent.

I adhere to my view, however, that\xe2\x80\x94our contrary precedents notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca matter of public rights \xe2\x80\xa6 must at a minimum arise between the government and others,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/33/index.html">492 U. S. 33</a>, 65 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sheer surfeit of factors that the Court was required to consider in this case should arouse the suspicion that something is seriously amiss with our jurisprudence in this area.  I count at least seven different reasons given in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge was required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one \xe2\x80\x9cunder state common law\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 27; that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98completely dependent upon\xe2\x80\x99 adjudication of a claim created by federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cPierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim in the bankruptcy court proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cthe asserted authority to decide Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not limited to a \xe2\x80\x98particularized area of the law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 28; that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was never any reason to believe that the process of adjudi-cating Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s proof of claim would necessarily resolve Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 32; that the trustee was not \xe2\x80\x9casserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 33; and that the Bankruptcy Judge \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] the power to enter \xe2\x80\x98appropriate orders and judgments\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94including final judgments\xe2\x80\x94subject to review only if a party chooses to appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from their sheer numerosity, the more fundamental flaw in the many tests suggested by our jurisprudence is that they have nothing to do with the text or tradition of Article III.  For example, Article III gives no indication that state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an Article III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to which the area of the law is \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized.\xe2\x80\x9d  The multifactors relied upon today seem to have entered our jurisprudence almost randomly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal administrative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse) by our landmark decision in <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a> (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in <em>all </em>federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established historical practice to the contrary.  For that reason\xe2\x80\x94and not because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and harms\xe2\x80\x94I agree that Article III judges are not required in the context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  See <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/index.html">458 U. S. 50</a>, 71 (1982) (plurality opinion).  Perhaps historical practice permits non-Article III judges to process claims against the bankruptcy estate, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L.\xc2\xa0J. 567, 607\xe2\x80\x93609 (1998); the subject has not been briefed, and so I state no position on the matter.  But Vickie points to no historical practice that authorizes a non-Article III judge to adjudicate a counterclaim of the sort at issue here.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963619">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSTERN V.

PIERCE MARSHALL</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[June 23, 2011]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan, join dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pierce Marshall filed a claim in Federal Bankruptcy Court against the estate of Vickie Marshall.  His claim asserted that Vickie Marshall had, through her lawyers, accused him of trying to prevent her from obtaining money that his father had wanted her to have; that her accusations violated state defamation law; and that she consequently owed Pierce Marshall damages.  Vickie Marshall filed a compulsory counterclaim in which she asserted that Pierce Marshall had unlawfully interfered with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to grant her an <em>inter vivos </em>gift and that he consequently owed her damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court adjudicated the claim and the counterclaim.  In doing so, the court followed statutory procedures applicable to \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy proceedings.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b).  And ultimately the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of Vickie Marshall.  The question before us is whether the Bankruptcy Court possessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Vickie Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  I agree with the Court that the bankruptcy statute, \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C), authorizes a bankruptcy court to adjudicate the counterclaim.  But I do not agree with the majority about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  I believe the statute is consistent with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s delegation of the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to the Judicial Branch of Government.  Art. III, \xc2\xa71.  Consequently, it is constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My disagreement with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion stems in part from my disagreement about the way in which it interprets, or at least emphasizes, certain precedents.  In my view, the majority overstates the current relevance of statements this Court made in an 1856 case, <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272 (1856), and it overstates the importance of an analysis that did not command a Court majority in <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/index.html">458 U. S. 50</a> (1982), and that was subsequently disavowed.  At the same time, I fear the Court understates the importance of a watershed opinion widely thought to demonstrate the constitutional basis for the current authority of administrative agencies to adjudicate private disputes, namely, <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a> (1932).  And it fails to follow the analysis that this Court more recently has held applicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before\nus here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation\nof adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers principles derived from Article III.  See <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/568/index.html">473 U. S. 568</a> (1985); <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Schor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/833/index.html">478 U. S. 833</a> (1986).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I shall describe these cases in some detail in order to explain why I believe we should put less weight than does the majority upon the statement in <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> and the analysis followed by the <em>Northern Pipeline </em>plurality and instead should apply the approach this Court has applied in <em>Crowell</em>, <em>Thomas</em>, and <em>Schor</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, the Court held that the Constitution permitted an executive official, through summary, nonjudicial proceedings, to attach the assets of a customs col-lector whose account was deficient.  The Court found evidence in common law of \xe2\x80\x9csummary method[s] for the recovery of debts due to the crown, and especially those due from receivers of the revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 How., at 277, and it analogized the Government\xe2\x80\x99s summary attachment process to the kind of self-help remedies available to private parties, <em>id</em>., at 283.  In the course of its opinion, the Court wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its na-\nture, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or\nin equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it bring under the judicial power a matter which, from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.  At the same time there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 284.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority reads the first part of the statement\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of Article III.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  I would read the statement in a less absolute way.  For one thing, the statement is in effect dictum.  For another, it is the remainder of the statement, announcing a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights,\xe2\x80\x9d that has had the more lasting impact.  Later Courts have seized on that distinction when <em>upholding</em> non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it down.  See <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/279/438/index.html">279 U. S. 438</a>, 451\xe2\x80\x93452 (1929) (Court of Customs Appeals); <em>Williams</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/553/index.html">289 U. S. 553</a>, 579\xe2\x80\x93580 (1933) (Court of Claims).  The one exception is <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>where the Court struck down the Bankruptcy Act of 1978.  But in that case there was no majority.  And a plurality, not a majority, read the statement roughly in the way the Court does today.  See 458 U. S., at 67\xe2\x80\x9370.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, I believe the majority places insuf-ficient weight on <em>Crowell</em>, a seminal case that clarified the scope of the dictum in <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>.  In that case,\nthe Court considered whether Congress could grant to an Article I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an employee\xe2\x80\x99s workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation claim against his employer.  The Court assumed that an Article III court would review the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision <em>de novo </em>in respect to questions of law but it would conduct a less searching review (looking to see only if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s award was \xe2\x80\x9csupported by evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x9d) in respect to questions of fact.  <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9350.  The Court pointed out that the case involved a dispute between private persons (a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d) and (with one exception not relevant here) it upheld Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of primary factfinding authority to the agency.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Brandeis, dissenting (from a here-irrelvant por-tion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory scheme raised only a due process question: When does due process require decision by an Article III judge?  He answered that question by finding constitutional the statute\xe2\x80\x99s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 87.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Crowell</em> has been hailed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest of the cases validating administrative adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bator, The Constitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative Courts Under Article III, 65 Ind. L.\xc2\xa0J. 233, 251 (1990).  Yet, in a footnote, the majority distinguishes <em>Crowell </em>as a case in which the Court upheld the delegation of adjudicatory authority to an administrative agency simply because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s power to make the \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized, narrowly confined factual determinations\xe2\x80\x9d at issue arising in a \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized area of law,\xe2\x80\x9d made the agency a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue \xe2\x80\x98adjunct\xe2\x80\x99 of the District Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23, n.\xc2\xa06.  Were <em>Crowell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding as narrow as the majority suggests,\none could question the validity of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of authority to adjudicate disputes among private parties to other agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, thereby resurrecting important legal questions previously thought to have been decided.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7160; 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718; 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710704; 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73612(b).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, in my view, overemphasizes the precedential effect of the plurality opinion in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9321.  There, the Court held unconstitutional the jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 granting adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy judges who lack the protections of tenure and compensation that Article III provides.  Four Members of the Court wrote that Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial cour[t]\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the judge conducts a \xe2\x80\x9ccourts-martial,\xe2\x80\x9d or (3) the case involves a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cat a minimum arise[s] \xe2\x80\x98between the government and others.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U. S., at 64\xe2\x80\x9370 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 451).  Two other Members of the Court, without accepting these limitations, agreed with the result because the case involved a breach- of-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on behalf of the bankruptcy estate against a third party who was not part of the bankruptcy proceeding, and none of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s preceding cases (which, the two Members wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not admit of easy synthesis\xe2\x80\x9d) had \xe2\x80\x9cgone so far as to sanction th[is] type of adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  458 U. S., at 90\xe2\x80\x9391 (Rehnquist, J. concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three years later, the Court held that <em>Northern Pipeline</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cestablishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thomas</em>, 473 U. S., at 584.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than leaning so heavily on the approach taken by the plurality in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, I would look to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s more recent Article III cases <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Schor\xe2\x80\x94</em>cases that commanded a clear majority.  In both cases\nthe Court took a more pragmatic approach to the constitutional question.  It sought to determine whether, in the particular instance, the challenged delegation of adjudicatory authority posed a genuine and serious threat that one branch of Government sought to aggrandize its own constitutionally delegated authority by encroaching upon a field of authority that the Constitution assigns exclusively to another branch.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Thomas</em>, the Court focused directly upon the nature of the Article III problem, illustrating how the Court should determine whether a delegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge violates the Constitution.  The statute in question required pesticide manufacturers to submit to binding arbitration claims for compensation owed for the use by one manufacturer of the data of another to support its federal pesticide registration.  After describing <em>Northern Pipeline</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding in the language I have set forth above, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 6, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>practical attention to substance </em>rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thomas</em>, 473 U. S., at 587 (emphasis added).  It indicated that Article III\xe2\x80\x99s requirements could not be \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cthe identity of the parties alone,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, or by the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d distinction, <em>id.</em>, at 585\xe2\x80\x93586.  And it upheld the arbitration provision of the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court pointed out that the right in question was created by a federal statute, it \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[s] a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading [certain] costs,\xe2\x80\x9d and the statute \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not preclude review of the arbitration proceeding by an Article III court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 589\xe2\x80\x93592.  The Court concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the nature of the right at issue and the concerns motivating the Legislature, we do not think this system threatens the independent role of the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 590.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most recently, in <em>Schor</em>, the Court described in greater detail how this Court should analyze this kind of Article III question.  The question at issue in <em>Schor</em> involved a delegation of authority to an agency to adjudicate a counterclaim.  A customer brought before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a claim for reparations against his commodity futures broker.  The customer noted that his brokerage account showed that he owed the broker money, but he said that the broker\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful actions had produced that debit balance, and he sought damages.  The broker brought a counterclaim seeking the money that the account showed the customer owed.  This Court had to decide whether agency adjudication of such a counterclaim is consistent with Article III.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In doing so, the Court expressly \xe2\x80\x9cdeclined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 851.  Rather, it \xe2\x80\x9cweighed a number of factors, none of which has been deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Those relevant factors include (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe origins and im-portance of the right to be adjudicated\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the range of ju-risdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts\xe2\x80\x9d; (3) the extent to which the delegation nonetheless reserves judicial power for exercise by Article III courts; (4) the presence or \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III tribunal\xe2\x80\x9d; and (5) \xe2\x80\x9cthe concerns that drove Congress to depart from\xe2\x80\x9d adjudication in an Article III court.  <em>Id</em>., at 849, 851.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court added that where \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d are involved, the \xe2\x80\x9cdanger of encroaching on the judicial powers\xe2\x80\x9d is greater.  <em>Id</em>., at 853\xe2\x80\x93854 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, while non-Article III adjudication of \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily unconstitutional, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cexamination\xe2\x80\x9d of such a scheme must be more \xe2\x80\x9csearching.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this analysis, the Court upheld the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority to adjudicate the counterclaim.  The Court con-ceded that the adjudication might be of a kind tradi-tionally decided by a court and that the rights at issue were \xe2\x80\x9cprivate,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cpublic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 853.  But, the Court said, the CFTC deals only with a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98particularized area of law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; the decision to invoke the CFTC forum is \xe2\x80\x9cleft entirely to the parties\xe2\x80\x9d; Article III courts can review the agency\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact under \xe2\x80\x9cthe same \xe2\x80\x98weight of the evidence\xe2\x80\x99 standard sustained in <em>Crowell</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and review its \xe2\x80\x9clegal determinations \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>de novo</em>\xe2\x80\x9d;<em> </em>and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccounterclaim jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d was necessary to make \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9creparations procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d which constitutes an important part of a congressionally enacted \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 852\xe2\x80\x93856.  The Court concluded that for these and other reasons \xe2\x80\x9cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed <em>de minimis.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 856.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case law, as applied in <em>Thomas</em> and <em>Schor</em>,<em> </em>requires us to determine pragmatically whether a congressional delegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge violates the separation-of-powers principles inherent in Article III.  That is to say, we must determine through an examination of certain relevant factors whether that delegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the Legislative or Executive Branches of Government upon the realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise by the Judicial Branch of Government.  Those factors include (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2) the nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to which Article III courts exercise control over the proceeding; (4) the presence or absence of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent; and (5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal with judges who lack Article III\xe2\x80\x99s tenure and compensation protections.  The presence of \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d does not automatically determine the outcome of the question but requires a more \xe2\x80\x9csearching\xe2\x80\x9d examination of the relevant factors.  <em>Schor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 854.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Insofar as the majority would apply more formal standards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent.  <em>Thomas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 587 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ractical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Schor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 851 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court has declined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules\xe2\x80\x9d for deciding Article III cases).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying <em>Schor\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>approach here, I conclude that the delegation of adjudicatory authority before us is consti-tutional.  A grant of authority to a bankruptcy court\nto adjudicate compulsory counterclaims does not violate any constitutional separation-of-powers principle related to Article III.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, I concede that <em>the nature of the claim to be adju-dicated</em> argues against my conclusion.  Vickie Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim\xe2\x80\x94a kind of tort suit\xe2\x80\x94resembles \xe2\x80\x9ca suit at the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284.  Although not determinative of the question, see <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 853, a delegation of authority to a non-Article III judge to adjudicate a claim of that kind poses a heightened risk of encroachment on the Federal Judiciary, <em>id.</em>, at 854.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>At the same time the significance of this factor is mitigated here by the fact that bankruptcy courts often decide claims that similarly resemble various common-law actions.  Suppose, for example, that ownership of 40 acres of land in the bankruptcy debtor\xe2\x80\x99s possession is disputed by a creditor.  If that creditor brings a claim in the bankruptcy court, resolution of that dispute requires the bankruptcy court to apply the same state property law that would govern in a state court proceeding.  This kind of dispute arises with regularity in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, in this instance the state-law question is embedded in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, not a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  But the counterclaim is \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory.\xe2\x80\x9d  It \xe2\x80\x9carises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 13(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7013.  Thus, resolution of the counterclaim will often turn on facts identical to, or at least related to, those at issue in a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim that is undisputedly proper for the bankruptcy court to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>the nature of the non-Article III tribunal</em> argues in favor of constitutionality.  That is because the tribunal is made up of judges who enjoy considerable protection from improper political influence.  Unlike the 1978 Act which provided for the appointment of bankruptcy judges by the President with the advice and consent of the\nSenate, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7152 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), current\nlaw provides that the federal courts of appeals appoint fed-eral bankruptcy judges, \xc2\xa7152(a)(1) (2006 ed.).  Bankruptcy judges are removable by the circuit judicial counsel (made up of federal court of appeals and district court judges) and only for cause.  \xc2\xa7152(e).  Their salaries are pegged to those of federal district court judges, \xc2\xa7153(a), and the cost of their courthouses and other work-related expenses are paid by the Judiciary, \xc2\xa7156.  Thus, although Congress technically exercised its Article I power when it created bankruptcy courts, functionally, bankruptcy judges can be compared to magistrate judges, law clerks, and the Judi-ciary\xe2\x80\x99s administrative officials, whose lack of Article III tenure and compensation protections do not endanger the independence of the Judicial Branch.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Third, <em>the control exercised by Article III judges over bankruptcy proceedings</em> argues in favor of constitutionality.  Article III judges control and supervise the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations\xe2\x80\x94at least to the same degree that Article III judges supervised the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determinations in <em>Crowell</em>,<em> </em>if not more so.  Any party may appeal those determinations to the federal district court, where the federal judge will review all determinations of fact for clear error and will review all determinations of law <em>de novo.</em>  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013; 10 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb68013.04 (16th ed. 2011).  But for the here-irrelevant matter of what <em>Crowell </em>considered to be special \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d facts, the standard of review for factual findings here (\xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d) is more stringent than the standard at issue in <em>Crowell </em>(whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding was \xe2\x80\x9csupported by evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x9d).  285 U. S., at 48; see <em>Dickinson</em> v. <em>Zurko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/150/index.html">527 U. S. 150</a>, 152, 153 (1999)<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cunsupported by substantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d more deferential than \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And, as <em>Crowell </em>noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no requirement that, in order to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in constitutional courts shall be made by judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U. S., at 51.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in one important respect Article III judges maintain greater control over the bankruptcy court proceedings at issue here than they did over the relevant proceedings in any of the previous cases in which this Court has upheld a delegation of adjudicatory power.  The District Court here may \xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred [to the Bankruptcy Court] . . . on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for cause shown.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(d); cf. <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, 458 U. S., at 80, n.\xc2\xa031 (plurality opinion) (contrasting\npre-1978 law where \xe2\x80\x9cpower to withdraw the case from\nthe [bankruptcy] referee\xe2\x80\x9d gave district courts \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d over case with<em> </em>the unconstitutional 1978 statute, which provided no such district court authority).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the fact that <em>the parties have consented</em> to Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction argues in favor of constitutionality, and strongly so.  Pierce Marshall, the counterclaim defendant, is not a stranger to the litigation, forced to appear in Bankruptcy Court against his will.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (suit was litigated in Bankruptcy Court \xe2\x80\x9cover [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] objection\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, he appeared voluntarily in Bankruptcy Court as one of Vickie Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s creditors, seeking a favorable resolution of his claim against Vickie Marshall to the detriment of her other creditors.  He need not have filed a claim, perhaps not even at the cost of bringing it in the future, for he says his claim is \xe2\x80\x9cnondischargeable,\xe2\x80\x9d in which case he could have litigated it in a state or federal court after distribution.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(6).  Thus, Pierce Marshall likely had \xe2\x80\x9can alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue [his] clai[m].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/33/index.html">492 U. S. 33</a>, 59, n.\xc2\xa014  (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that this type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordinary bankruptcy court proceedings.  In <em>Granfinanciera, </em>the Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to void a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual on the ground that the transfer to that individual constitutes an unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cpreference,\xe2\x80\x9d the question of whether the individual has a right to a jury trial \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon whether the creditor has submitted a claim against the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 58.  The following year, in <em>Langenkamp</em> v. <em>Culp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/42/index.html">498 U. S. 42</a> (1990) <em>(per curiam)</em>, the Court emphasized that when the individual files a claim against the estate, that individual has</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ctrigger[ed] the process of \xe2\x80\x98allowance and disallowance of claims,\xe2\x80\x99 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable power.  If the creditor is met, in turn, with a preference action from the trustee, that action becomes part of the claims-allowance process which is triable only in equity.  In other words, the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim and the ensuing preference action by the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>equity jurisdiction</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (quoting <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U. S., at 58; citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs we have recognized, the jury trial question and the Article III question are highly analogous.  See <em>id.,</em> at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  And to that extent, <em>Granfinanciera</em>\xe2\x80\x99s and <em>Langen-kamp</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even when private rights are at issue, non-Article III adjudication may be appropriate when both parties consent.  Cf. <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 80, n.\xc2\xa031 (plurality opinion) (noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy juris-diction).  See also <em>Schor</em>, 478 U. S., at 849 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]bsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III tribunal was relied on [in <em>Northern Pipeline</em>] as a significant factor in determining that Article III forbade such adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority argues that Pierce Marshall \xe2\x80\x9cdid not truly consent\xe2\x80\x9d to bankruptcy jurisdiction, <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in <em>Langenkamp</em> and <em>Granfinanciera</em>, and there is no relevant distinction between the claims filed in those cases and the claim filed here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, <em>the nature and importance of the legislative purpose served</em> by the grant of adjudicatory authority to\nbankruptcy tribunals argues strongly in favor of constitutionality.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of adjudicatory powers over counterclaims asserted against bankruptcy claimants constitutes an important means of securing a constitutionally authorized end.  Article I, \xc2\xa78, of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the \xe2\x80\x9cPower To \xe2\x80\xa6 establish \xe2\x80\xa6 uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers<em> </em>that the</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cpower of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 42, p. 271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800.  2 Stat. 19.  From the beginning, the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d of federal bankruptcy proceedings has been \xe2\x80\x9cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Northern Pipeline</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 71 (plurality opinion).  And, to be effective, a single tribunal must have broad authority to restructure those relations, \xe2\x80\x9chaving jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought before them,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[ing] all matters in dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdecree[ing] complete relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Katchen</em> v. <em>Landy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/382/323/index.html">382 U. S. 323</a>, 335 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The restructuring process requires a creditor to file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court. 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7501; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3002(a).  In doing so, the creditor \xe2\x80\x9ctriggers the process of \xe2\x80\x98allowance and disallowance of claims,\xe2\x80\x99 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Langenkamp</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 44 (quoting <em>Granfinanciera</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 58).  By filing a proof of claim, the creditor agrees to the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of that claim, and if the creditor wins, the creditor will receive a share of the distribution of the bankruptcy estate.  When the bankruptcy estate has a related claim against that creditor, that counterclaim may offset the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim, or even yield additional damages that augment the estate and may be distributed to the other creditors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequent importance to the total bankruptcy scheme of permitting the trustee in bankruptcy to assert counterclaims against claimants, <em>and resolving those counterclaims in a bankruptcy court</em>, is reflected in the\nfact that Congress included \xe2\x80\x9ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate\xe2\x80\x9d on its list of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ore proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(C).  And it explains the difference, reflected in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, between a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s and a nonclaimant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to a jury trial.  Compare <em>Granfinanciera</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 58\xe2\x80\x9359 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause petitioners \xe2\x80\xa6 have not filed claims against the estate\xe2\x80\x9d they retain \xe2\x80\x9ctheir Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Langenkamp</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 45 (\xe2\x80\x9cRespondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsequently, they were not entitled to a jury trial\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of such matters has more than \xe2\x80\x9csome bearing on a bankruptcy case.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 34 (emphasis deleted).  It plays a critical role in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 constitutionally based effort to create an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system.  At the least, that is what Congress concluded.  We owe deference to that determination, which shows the absence of any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or desire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves\nto judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation protections.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in <em>Schor</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed <em>de minimis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U. S., at 856.<em> </em>I would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority predicts that as a \xe2\x80\x9cpractical matter\xe2\x80\x9d today\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not change all that much.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  But I doubt that is so.  Consider a typical case:\nA tenant files for bankruptcy.  The landlord files a claim for unpaid rent.  The tenant asserts a counterclaim for damages suffered by the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s (1) failing to fulfill his obligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering possession of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in housing court.  (These are close to the facts presented in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Beugen</em>, 81 B.\xc2\xa0R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).)  This state-law counterclaim does not \xe2\x80\x9cste[m] from the bankruptcy itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 34, it would not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., and it would require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the lessor\xe2\x80\x99s failures, the extent to which the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s representations to the housing court were untrue, and damages suffered by improper recovery of possession of the premises, cf. <em>ante</em>, at 33-33.  Thus, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would have to hear and resolve the counterclaim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why is that a problem?  Because these types of disputes arise in bankruptcy court with some frequency.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re CBI Holding Co., </em>529 F.\xc2\xa03d 432 (CA2 2008) (state-law claims and counterclaims); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Winstar Communications, Inc.</em>, 348 B.\xc2\xa0R. 234 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2005) (same); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ascher</em>, 128 B.\xc2\xa0R. 639 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1991) (same); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Sun West Distributors, Inc.</em>, 69 B.\xc2\xa0R. 861 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Cal. 1987) (same).  Because the volume of bankruptcy cases is staggering, involving almost 1.6 million filings last year, compared to a federal district court docket of around 280,000 civil cases and 78,000 criminal cases.  Administrative Office of the United States Courts, J. Duff, Judicial Business of the United States Courts: Annual Report of the Director 14 (2010).  Because unlike the \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d non-core state law claims that bankruptcy courts must abstain from hearing, <em>see ante</em>, at 36, compulsory counterclaims involve the same factual disputes as the claims that may be finally adjudicated by the bankruptcy courts.  Because under these circumstances, a constitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong between courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost, delay, and needless additional suffering among those faced with bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
