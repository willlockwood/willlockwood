JUSTICE BURTON announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the following opinion, in which MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases the same issue is raised by the dismissal of a complaint for its failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  That issue is whether, in the face of the facts alleged in the complaint and therefore admitted by the motion to dismiss, the Attorney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 341 U. S. 125</a></p><p> General of the United States has authority to include the complaining organization in a list of organizations designated by him as Communist and furnished by him to the Loyalty Review Board of the United States Civil Service Commission.  He claims to derive authority to do this from the following provisions in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of Executive Order No. 9835, issued by the President, March 21, 1947:</p>\n<p>"<em>Part III -- Responsibilities of Civil Service Commission" </em></p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"3. The Loyalty Review Board shall currently be furnished by the Department of Justice the name of each foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, group or combination of persons which the Attorney General, after appropriate investigation and determination, designates as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive, or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means."</p>\n<p>"a. The Loyalty Review Board shall disseminate such information to all departments and agencies."</p>\n<p>3 CFR, 1947 Supp., pp. 129, 131, 12 Fed.Reg. 1935, 1938.</p>\n<p>The respective complaints describe the complaining organizations as engaged in charitable or civic activities or in the business of fraternal insurance.  Each implies an attitude of cooperation and helpfulness, rather than one of hostility or disloyalty, on the part of the organization toward the United States.  Two of the complaints deny expressly that the organization is within any classification specified in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of the order. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 341 U. S. 126</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For the reasons hereinafter stated, we conclude that, if the allegations of the complaints are taken as true (as they must be on the motions to dismiss), the Executive Order does not authorize the Attorney General to furnish the Loyalty Review Board with a list containing such a designation as he gave to each of these organizations without other justification.  Under such circumstances, his own admissions render his designations patently arbitrary, because they are contrary to the alleged and uncontroverted facts constituting the entire record before us.  The complaining organizations have not been afforded any opportunity to substantiate their allegations, but, at this stage of the proceedings, the Attorney General has chosen not to deny their allegations, and has not otherwise placed them in issue.</p>\n<p>Whatever may be his authority to designate these organizations as Communist upon undisclosed facts in his possession, he has not chosen to limit himself to that authorization.  By his present procedure, he has claimed authority so to designate them upon the very facts alleged by them in their own complaints.  Self-serving or not, those allegations do not state facts from which, alone, a reasonable determination can be derived that the organizations are Communist.  To defend such a designation of them on the basis of the complaints alone is an assertion of Presidential authority so to designate an organization at the option of the Attorney General without reliance upon either disclosed or undisclosed facts supplying a reasonable basis for the determination.  It is that, and only that outer limit of the authority of the Attorney General that is now before us.</p>\n<p>At least since 1939, increasing concern has been expressed, in and out of Congress, as to the possible presence in the employ of the Government of persons disloyal to it.  This is reflected in the legislation, reports and executive orders culminating in Executive Order No. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 341 U. S. 127</a></p><p> 9835. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  That order announced the President\'s Employees Loyalty Program in the Executive Branch of the Government.  It states that both</p>\n<p>"maximum protection must be afforded the United States against infiltration of disloyal persons into the ranks of its employees, and equal protection from unfounded accusations of disloyalty must be afforded the loyal employees of the Government . . ."</p>\n<p>It provides for the Loyalty Review Board, and sets up a standard for refusals of and removals from employment on grounds relating to loyalty.  It outlines the use to be made in that connection of the list of organizations to be furnished by the Attorney General. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 341 U. S. 128</a></p><p> organizations to be designated on that list are not limited to those having federal employees in their memberships.  They may even exclude such employees from membership.  Accordingly, the impact of the Attorney General\'s list is by no means limited to persons who are subject to the Employees Loyalty Program.</p>\n<p>The Attorney General included each of the complaining organizations in the list he furnished to the Loyalty Review Board November 24, 1947.  That list was disseminated by the Board to all departments and agencies of the United States December 4, 1947.  13 Fed.Reg. 1473. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The complaints allege that such action resulted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 341 U. S. 129</a></p><p> in nationwide publicity and caused the injuries to the complaining organizations which are detailed later.  September 17, 1948, during the pendency of the instant cases but before action upon the appeals in any of them,</p>\n<p>"the Attorney General furnished the Loyalty Review Board with a consolidated list containing the names of all of the organizations previously designated by him as within Executive Order 9835, segregated according to the classifications enumerated in section 3, Part III, on the basis of dominant characteristics. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>He enumerated six classifications and classified the three complaining organizations as "Communist." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 341 U. S. 130</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The instant cases originated in the District Court for the District of Columbia, and come here after affirmance by the Court of Appeals.  We granted certiorari because of the importance of the issues and their relation to the Employees Loyalty Program.  No. 8, 339 U.S. 910; No. 7, 339 U.S. 956; No. 71, 340 U.S. 805.</p>\n<p><em>No. 8. -- THE REFUGEE COMMITTEE CASE\n</em></p>\n<p>The complainant is the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, an unincorporated association in the City and State of New York.  It is the petitioner here.  The defendants in the original action were the Attorney General, Tom C. Clark, and the members of the Loyalty Review Board.  J. Howard McGrath has been substituted as the Attorney General, and he and the members of that Board are the respondents here.</p>\n<p>The following statement, based on the allegations of the complaint, summarizes the situation before us:  the complainant is "a charitable organization engaged in relief work" which carried on its relief activities from 1942 to 1946 under a license from the President\'s War Relief Control Board.  Thereafter, it voluntarily submitted its program, budgets and audits for inspection by the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid of the United States Government.  Since its inception, it has, through voluntary contributions, raised and disbursed funds for the benefit of anti-Fascist refugees who assisted the Government of Spain against its overthrow by force and violence.  The organization\'s aims and purposes</p>\n<p>"are to raise, administer and distribute funds for the relief and rehabilitation of Spanish Republicans in exile and other  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 341 U. S. 131</a></p><p> anti-fascist refugees who fought in the war against Franco. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]"</p>\n<p>It has disbursed $1,011,448 in cash, and $217,903 in kind, for the relief of anti-Fascist refugees and their families.  This relief has included money, food, shelter, educational facilities, medical treatment and supplies, and clothing to recipients in 11 countries, including the United States.  The acts of the Attorney General and the Loyalty Review Board, purporting to be taken by them under authority of the Executive Order, have seriously and irreparably impaired, and will continue to so impair, the reputation of the organization and the moral support and good will of the American people necessary for the continuance of its charitable activities.  Upon information and belief, these acts have caused many contributors, especially present and prospective civil servants, to reduce or discontinue their contributions to the organization; members and participants in its activities have been "vilified and subjected to public shame, disgrace, ridicule and obloquy . . . ", thereby inflicting upon it economic injury and discouraging participation in its activities; it has been hampered in securing meeting places; and many people have refused to take part in its fund-raising activities.</p>\n<p>This complaint does not contain an express denial that the complaining organization is within the classifications </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 341 U. S. 132</a></p><p> named in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of Executive Order No. 9835.  It does, however, state that the actions of the Attorney General and the Loyalty Review Board which are complained of are unauthorized and without warrant in law, and amount to a deprivation of the complainant\'s rights in violation of the Constitution; that Executive Order No. 9835, on its face and as construed and applied, violates the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and that \xc2\xa7 9A of the Hatch Act, 53 Stat. 1148, 5 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. III) \xc2\xa7 118j, insofar as it purports to authorize the instant application of the order, is void. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It asks for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the complaining organization is suffering irreparable loss and that no adequate remedy is available to it except through the equity powers of the District Court.  That court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint for its failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and denied the complainant\'s motion for a preliminary injunction. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting.  <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. Clark,</em> 85 U.S.App.D.C. 255, 177 F.2d 79.</p>\n<p><em>No. 7. -- THE NATIONAL COUNCIL CASE\n</em></p>\n<p>In this case, the court below relied upon its decision in the <em>Refugee Committee</em> case and reached the same result, per curiam (unreported).  Except as indicated below in our summary of the facts alleged, this case, for our purposes, is like the first.  The complainants, who are the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 341 U. S. 133</a></p><p> petitioners here, are the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, Inc., a New York nonprofit membership corporation, organized in 1943; the Denver Council of American-Soviet Friendship, a Colorado unincorporated association and local affiliate of the National Council; and six individual officers and directors of one or the other of these organizations.  The purpose of the National Council</p>\n<p>"is to strengthen friendly relations between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by disseminating to the American people educational material regarding the Soviet Union, by developing cultural relations between the peoples of the two nations, and by combatting anti-Soviet propaganda designed to disrupt friendly relations between the peoples of these nations and to divide the United Nations."</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that all of the complainants are seriously and irreparably injured in their capacity to conduct the National Council\'s educational, cultural and fund-raising program, and that the individual complainants have suffered personal losses such as the removal of one from an assistant rectorship of a church, the loss by another of a teaching position, and numerous cancellations of lecturing and professional engagements.  The complaint expressly states that --</p>\n<p>"In all its activities, the National Council has sought to further the best interests of the American people by lawful, peaceful and constitutional means.  It has never in any way engaged in any conduct or activity which provides any basis for it to be designated as"</p>\n<p>"totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive, or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 341 U. S. 134</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>No. 71. -- THE INTERNATIONAL WORKERS CASE\n</em></p>\n<p>The complaining organization, which is the petitioner here, is a fraternal benefit society, organized in 1930 as a corporation under the Insurance Law of the State of New York operating for the mutual benefit of its members and their beneficiaries and not for profit.  It is licensed and operates in the District of Columbia and several states; its purposes are comparable to those of fraternal benefit societies in general; it operates under a lodge system, and has a representative form of government; at the time of the promulgation of the Department of Justice list, it had 185,000 members, including employees of the Federal Government and of various states and municipalities; it provided life insurance protection for its membership exceeding $120,000,000; its activities have been the subject of administrative and judicial proceedings in addition to those before the insurance departments of the states in which it functions, and, as a result of such proceedings, "the purposes, and activities of the order have been held to be free from any illegal or improper taint. . . ." [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Among the allegations of damage, made upon information and belief, the complaint states that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 341 U. S. 135</a></p><p> solely as a result of the respondents\' acts, there have been instituted against the order and its members a multiplicity of administrative proceedings, including those to rescind licenses, franchises, or tax exemptions, or to impede the naturalization of its members. Because of respondents\' acts, many such members, especially present and prospective civil servants, have resigned or withdrawn from membership in the order, and many potential members have declined to join it. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The second amended complaint was dismissed by the District Court, 88 F.Supp. 873.  That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting.  86 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 182 F.2d 368.</p>\n<p><em>-----\n</em></p>\n<p>If, upon the allegations in any of these complaints, it had appeared that the acts of the respondents, from which relief was sought, were authorized by the President under his Executive Order No. 9835, the case would have bristled with constitutional issues.  On that basis, the complaint would have raised questions as to the justiciability and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 341 U. S. 136</a></p><p> merit of claims based upon the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution.  It is our obligation, however, not to reach those issues unless the allegations before us squarely present them.  <em>See United States v. Lovett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/303/case.html">328 U. S. 303</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/303/case.html#320">328 U. S. 320</a></span>.  <em>Cf. United Public Workers v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/75/case.html">330 U. S. 75</a></span>; <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Executive Order contains no express or implied attempt to confer power on anyone to act arbitrarily or capriciously -- even assuming a constitutional power to do so.  The order includes in the purposes of the President\'s program not only the protection of the United States against disloyal employees, but the "equal protection" of loyal employees against unfounded accusations of disloyalty.  3 CFR, 1947 Supp., p. 129, 12 Fed.Reg. 1935.  The standards stated for refusal of and removal from employment require that, "on all the evidence, reasonable grounds [shall] exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 132, 12 Fed.Reg. 1938.  Obviously it would be contrary to the purpose of that order to place on a list to be disseminated under the Loyalty Program any designation of an organization that was patently arbitrary and contrary to the uncontroverted material facts.  The order contains the express requirement that each designation of an organization by the Attorney General on such a list shall be made only after an "appropriate . . . determination" as prescribed in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3.  An "appropriate" governmental "determination" must be the result of a process of reasoning.  It cannot be an arbitrary fiat contrary to the known facts.  This is inherent in the meaning of "determination."  It is implicit in a government of laws, and not of men.  Where an act of an official plainly falls outside of the scope of his authority, he does not make that act legal by doing it and then invoking the doctrine of administrative construction to cover it. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 341 U. S. 137</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It remains, therefore, for us to decide whether, <em>on the face of these complaints,</em> the Attorney General is acting within his authority in furnishing the Loyalty Review Board with a designation of the complaining organizations either as "Communist" or as within any other classification of Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of the order.  In the <em>National Council</em> and <em>International Workers</em> cases, the complaining organization is alleged not only to be a civic or insurance organization, apparently above reproach from the point of view of loyalty to the United States, but it is also declared to be one that is not within any classification listed in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of the order.  In the <em>Refugee Committee</em> case, the negative allegations are omitted, but the affirmative allegations are incompatible with the inclusion of the complaining organization within any of the designated classifications.  The inclusion of any of the complaining organizations in the designated list solely on the facts alleged in the respective complaints, which must be the basis for our decision here, is therefore an arbitrary and unauthorized act.  In the two cases where the complaint specifically alleges the factual absence of any basis for the designation, and the respondents\' motion admits that allegation, the designation is necessarily contrary to the record.  The situation is comparable to one which would be created if the Attorney General, under like circumstances, were to designate the American National Red Cross as a Communist organization.  Accepting as common knowledge the charitable and loyal status of that organization, there is no doubt that, in the absence of any contrary claim asserted against it, the Executive Order does not authorize its inclusion by the Attorney General as a "Communist" organization or as coming within any of the other classifications named in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of the order.</p>\n<p>Since we find that the conduct ascribed to the Attorney General by the complaints is patently arbitrary, the deference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 341 U. S. 138</a></p><p> ordinarily due administrative construction of an administrative order is not sufficient to bring his alleged conduct within the authority conferred by Executive Order No. 9835.  The doctrine of administrative construction never has been carried so far as to permit administrative discretion to run riot.  If applied to this case and compounded with the assumption that the President\'s Executive Order was drafted for him by his Attorney General, the conclusion would rest upon the premise that the Attorney General has attempted to delegate to himself the power to act arbitrarily.  We cannot impute such an attempt to the Nation\'s highest law enforcement officer any more than we can to its President.</p>\n<p>In thus emphasizing an outer limit to what can be considered an authorized designation of an organization under the order, the instant cases serve a valuable purpose.  They demonstrate that the order does not authorize, much less direct, the exercise of any such absolute power as would permit the inclusion in the Attorney General\'s list of a designation that is patently arbitrary or contrary to fact.

Their effect is to cripple the functioning and damage the reputation of those organizations in their respective communities and in the nation.  The complaints, on that basis, sufficiently charge that such acts violate each complaining organization\'s common law right to be free from defamation.</p>\n<p>"A communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him."</p>\n<p>Restatement, Torts, \xc2\xa7 559.

It may well be that a designated organization, by reason of origin, leadership, control, purposes, policies or activities, alone or in combination, may fall within more than one of the specified classifications.  In such cases, a reasonable interpretation of the Executive order would seem to require that designation be predicated upon its dominant characteristics, rather than extended to include all other classifications possible on the basis of what may be subordinate attributes of the group.

No comparable alternative relief is available here.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.</p>\n<p>Without notice or hearing, and under color of the President\'s Executive Order No. 9835, the Attorney General found petitioners guilty of harboring treasonable opinions and designs, officially branded them as Communists, and promulgated his findings and conclusions for particular use as evidence against government employees suspected of disloyalty.  In the present climate of public opinion, it appears certain that the Attorney General\'s much publicized findings, regardless of their truth or falsity, are the practical equivalents of confiscation and death sentences for any blacklisted organization not possessing extraordinary financial, political or religious prestige and influence.  The Government not only defends the power of the Attorney General to pronounce such deadly edicts, but also argues that individuals or groups so condemned have no standing to seek redress in the courts, even though a fair judicial hearing might conclusively demonstrate their loyalty.  My basic reasons for rejecting these and other contentions of the Government are in summary the following: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 341 U. S. 143</a></p><p></p>\n<p>(1) I agree with MR. JUSTICE BURTON that petitioners have standing to sue for the reason among others that they have a right to conduct their admittedly legitimate political, charitable and business operations free from unjustified governmental defamation.  Otherwise, executive officers could act lawlessly with impunity.  And, assuming that the President may constitutionally authorize the promulgation of the Attorney General\'s list, I further agree with MR. JUSTICE BURTON that this Court should not attribute to the President a purpose to vest in a cabinet officer the power to destroy political, social, religious or business organizations by "arbitrary fiat," and thus the methods employed by the Attorney General exceed his authority under Executive Order No. 9835.</p>\n<p>(2) Assuming, though I deny, that the Constitution permits the executive officially to determine, list and publicize individuals and groups as traitors and public enemies, I agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment would bar such condemnation without notice and a fair hearing.  My views previously expressed under similar circumstances are relevant here.  <em>E.g.,</em> dissenting opinion in <em>Ludecke v. Watkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/160/case.html">335 U. S. 160</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/160/case.html#173">335 U. S. 173</a></span>; <em>and see In re Oliver,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/257/case.html">333 U. S. 257</a></span>.</p>\n<p>(3) More fundamentally, however, in my judgment, the executive has no constitutional authority, with or without a hearing, officially to prepare and publish the lists challenged by petitioners.  In the first place, the system adopted effectively punishes many organizations and their members merely because of their political beliefs and utterances, and, to this extent, smacks of a most evil type of censorship.  This cannot be reconciled with the First Amendment as I interpret it.  <em>See</em> my dissent in <em>American Communications Assn. v. Douds,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html">339 U. S. 382</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/case.html#445">339 U. S. 445</a></span>.  Moreover, officially prepared and proclaimed governmental </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 341 U. S. 144</a></p><p> blacklists possess almost every quality of bills of attainder, the use of which was from the beginning forbidden to both national and state governments.  U.S.Const. Art. I, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9, 10.  It is true that the classic bill of attainder was a condemnation by the legislature following investigation by that body, <em>see United States v.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>There is argument that executive power to issue these pseudo-bills of attainder can be implied from the undoubted power of the Government to hire and discharge employees and to protect itself against treasonable individuals or organizations.

His views in this regard are reported as follows:</p>\n<p>"It is in vain to say that this indiscriminate censure is no punishment.

Thus, an employee may lose his job because of the Attorney General\'s secret and <em>ex parte</em> action.  This is well illustrated in the case of <em>Bailey v.

The Loyalty Board\'s finding against Miss Bailey appears to have rested in part on her supposed association with such organizations and in part on secret unsworn hearsay statements communicated to the Board by anonymous informers.

JUSTICE BLACK.\n</em></p>\n<p>James II, the last Stuart king of England, was driven from his throne in 1688 by William of Orange.  After a brief sojourn at Saint Germains in France, James landed in Ireland, where he was supported by those Irish Catholics who had suffered greatly at the hands of the English Protestant colonists.  One of his first official acts was to call an Irish Parliament, which enacted the bill of attainder described by the historian Macaulay as follows:</p>\n<p>". . . [the Commons] respected no prerogative, however ancient, however legitimate, however salutary, if they apprehended that [James II] might use it to protect the race which they abhorred.  They were not satisfied till they had extorted his reluctant consent to a portentous law, a law without a parallel in the history of civilised countries, the great Act of Attainder."</p>\n<p>"A list was framed containing between two and three thousand names.  At the top was half the peerage of Ireland.  Then came baronets, knights, clergymen, squires, merchants, yeomen, artisans, women, children.  No investigation was made.  Any member who wished to rid himself of a creditor, a rival, a private enemy, gave in the name to the clerk at the table, and it was generally inserted without discussion.  The only debate of which any account has come down to us related to the Earl of Strafford.  He had friends in the House who ventured to offer something in his favour.  But a few words from  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 341 U. S. 147</a></p><p> Simon Luttrell settled the question.  \'I have,\' he said, \'heard the King say some hard things of that lord.\'  This was thought sufficient, and the name of Strafford stands fifth in the long table of the proscribed."</p>\n<p>"Days were fixed before which those whose names were on the list were required to surrender themselves to such justice as was then administered to English Protestants in Dublin.  If a proscribed person was in Ireland, he must surrender himself by the tenth of August.  If he had left Ireland since the fifth of November, 1688, he must surrender himself by the first of September.  If he had left Ireland before the fifth of November, 1688, he must surrender himself by the first of October.  If he failed to appear by the appointed day, he was to be hanged, drawn, and quartered without a trial, and his property was to the confiscated.  It might be physically impossible for him to deliver himself up within the time fixed by the Act.  He might be bedridden.  He might be in the West Indies.  He might be in prison.  Indeed there notoriously were such cases.  Among the attainted Lords was Mountjoy.  He had been induced by the villany of Tyrconnel to trust himself at Saint Germains; he had been thrown into the Bastile; he was still lying there; and the Irish parliament was not ashamed to enact that, unless he could, within a few weeks, make his escape from his cell and present himself at Dublin, he should be put to death."</p>\n<p>"As it was not even pretended that there had been any inquiry into the guilt of those who were thus proscribed, as not a single one among them had been heard in his own defence, and as it was certain that it would be physically impossible for many of them to surrender themselves in time, it was clear that nothing but a large exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy could prevent the perpetration of iniquities so horrible that no precedent could be found for them even in the lamentable history of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 341 U. S. 148</a></p><p> troubles of Ireland.  The Commons therefore determined that the royal prerogative of mercy should be limited.  Several regulations were devised for the purpose of making the passing of pardons difficult and costly, and finally it was enacted that every pardon granted by his Majesty, after the end of November, 1689, to any of the many hundreds of persons who had been sentenced to death without a trial should be absolutely void and of none effect.  Sir Richard Nagle came in state to the bar of the Lords and presented the bill with a speech worthy of the occasion.  \'Many of the persons here attainted,\' said he, \'have been proved traitors by such evidence as satisfies us.  As to the rest, we have followed common fame.\'"</p>\n<p>"With such reckless barbarity was the list framed that fanatical royalists, who were, at that very time, hazarding their property, their liberty, their lives, in the cause of James, were not secure from proscription.  The most learned man of whom the Jacobite party could boast was Henry Dodwell, Camdenian Professor in the University of Oxford.  In the cause of hereditary monarchy, he shrank from no sacrifice and from no danger.  It was about him that William [of Orange] uttered those memorable words:  \'He has set his heart on being a martyr; and I have set mine on disappointing him.\'  But James was more cruel to friends than William to foes.  Dodwell was a Protestant; he had some property in Connaught; these crimes were sufficient, and he was set down in the long roll of those who were doomed to the gallows and the quartering block."</p>\n<p>"That James would give his assent to a bill which took from him the power of pardoning, seemed to many persons impossible. . . .  He might also have seen that the right course was the wise course.  Had he, on this great occasion, had the spirit to declare that he would not shed the blood of the innocent, and that, even as respected the guilty, he would not divest himself of the power of tempering </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 341 U. S. 149</a></p><p> judgment with mercy, he would have regained more hearts in England than he would have lost in Ireland.  But it was ever his fate to resist where he should have yielded and to yield where he should have resisted.  The most wicked of all laws received his sanction, and it is but a very small extenuation of his guilt that his sanction was somewhat reluctantly given."</p>\n<p>"That nothing might be wanting to the completeness of this great crime, extreme care was taken to prevent the persons who were attainted from knowing that they were attainted till the day of grace fixed in the Act was passed.  The roll of names was not published, but kept carefully locked up in Fitton\'s closet.  Some Protestants, who still adhered to the cause of James but who were anxious to know whether any of their friends or relations had been proscribed, tried hard to obtain a sight of the list, but solicitation, remonstrance, even bribery proved vain.  Not a single copy got abroad till it was too late for any of the thousands who had been condemned without a trial to obtain a pardon."</p>\n<p>". . .  That the colonists, when they had won the victory, grossly abused it, that their legislation was, during many years, unjust and tyrannical, is most true.  But it is not less true that they never quite came up to the atrocious example set by their vanquished enemy during his short tenure of power."</p>\n<p>3 Macaulay, History of England from the Accession of James the Second (London, 1855) 216-220.  (Footnotes appearing in the original have been omitted.)</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.</p>\n<p>The more issues of law are inescapably entangled in political controversies, especially those that touch the passions of the day, the more the Court is under duty to dispose of a controversy within the narrowest confines </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 341 U. S. 150</a></p><p> that intellectual integrity permits.  And so I sympathize with the endeavor of my brother BURTON to decide these cases on a ground as limited as that which has commended itself to him.  Unfortunately, I am unable to read the pleadings as he does.  Therefore, I must face up to larger issues.  But in a case raising delicate constitutional questions, it is particularly incumbent first to satisfy the threshold inquiry whether we have any business to decide the case at all.  Is there, in short, a litigant before us who has a claim presented in a form and under conditions "appropriate for judicial determination"?  <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html">300 U. S. 227</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html#240">300 U. S. 240</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Limitation on "the judicial Power of the United States" is expressed by the requirement that a litigant must have "standing to sue" or, more comprehensively, that a federal court may entertain a controversy only if it is "justiciable."  Both characterizations mean that a court will not a decide a question unless the nature of the action challenged, the kind of injury inflicted, and the relationship between the parties are such that judicial determination is consonant with what was, generally speaking, the business of the Colonial courts and the courts of Westminster when the Constitution was framed.  The jurisdiction of the federal courts can be invoked only under circumstances which to the expert feel of lawyers constitute a "case or controversy."   The scope and consequences of the review with which the judiciary is entrusted over executive and legislative action require us to observe these bounds fastidiously.  <em>See</em> the course of decisions beginning with <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/409/case.html">Hayburn\'s Case,</a></span></em> 2 Dall. 409, through <em>Parker v. Los Angeles County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/327/case.html">338 U. S. 327</a></span>.  These generalities have had myriad applications.  Each application, even to a situation not directly pertinent to what </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 341 U. S. 151</a></p><p> is before us, reflects considerations relevant to decision here.  I shall confine my inquiry, however, by limiting it to suits seeking relief from governmental action.</p>\n<p>(1) The simplest application of the concept of "standing" is to situations in which there is no real controversy between the parties.  Regard for the separation of powers, <em>see Muskrat v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/219/346/case.html">219 U. S. 346</a></span>, and for the importance to correct decision of adequate presentation of issues by clashing interests, <em>see Chicago &amp; G.T. R. Co. v. Wellman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/339/case.html">143 U. S. 339</a></span>, restricts the courts of the United States to issues presented in an adversary manner.  A petitioner does not have standing to sue unless he is "interested in, and affected adversely by, the decision" of which he seeks review.  His "interest must be of a personal, and not of an official, nature."  <em>Braxton County Court v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/192/case.html">208 U. S. 192</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/192/case.html#197">208 U. S. 197</a></span>; <em>see also Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html">262 U. S. 447</a></span>.  The interest must not be wholly negligible, as that of a taxpayer of the Federal Government is considered to be, <em>Frothingham v. Mellon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html">262 U. S. 447</a></span>; <em>cf. Crampton v. Zabriskie,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/601/case.html">101 U. S. 601</a></span>.  A litigant must show more than that "he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally."  <em>Frothingham v. Mellon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/case.html#488">262 U. S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Adverse personal interest, even of such an indirect sort as arises from competition, is ordinarily sufficient to meet constitutional standards of justiciability.  The courts may therefore by statute be given jurisdiction over claims based on such interests.  <em>Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Radio Station,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/470/case.html">309 U. S. 470</a></span>; <em>cf. Interstate Commerce Comm\'n v. Oregon-Washington R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/14/case.html">288 U. S. 14</a></span>.</p>\n<p>(2) To require a court to intervene in the absence of a statute, however, either on constitutional grounds or in the exercise of inherent equitable powers, something more than adverse personal interest is needed.  This additional element is usually defined in terms which assume the answer.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 341 U. S. 152</a></p><p> It is said that the injury must be "a wrong which directly results in the violation of a legal right."  <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/464/case.html">302 U. S. 464</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/464/case.html#479">302 U. S. 479</a></span>.  Or that the controversy "must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests."  <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html#240">300 U. S. 240</a></span>-241.  These terms have meaning only when contained by the facts to which they have been applied.  In seeking to determine whether in the case before us the standards they reflect are met, therefore, we must go to the decisions.  They show that the existence of "legal" injury has turned on the answer to one or more of these questions:  (a) will the action challenged at any time substantially affect the "legal" interests of any person? (b) does the action challenged affect the petitioner with sufficient "directness"? (c) is the action challenged sufficiently "final"?  Since each of these questions itself contains a word of art, we must look to experience to find their meaning.</p>\n<p>(a) <em>Will the action challenged at any time substantially affect the "legal" interests of any person?</em>  A litigant ordinarily has standing to challenge governmental action of a sort that, if taken by a private person, would create a right of action cognizable by the courts.  <em>United States v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/196/case.html">106 U. S. 196</a></span>. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  Or standing may be based on an interest created by the Constitution or a statute.  <em>E.g., Parker v. Fleming,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/531/case.html">329 U. S. 531</a></span>; <em>Coleman v. Miller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/433/case.html">307 U. S. 433</a></span>; <em>cf. Bell v. Hood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/case.html">327 U. S. 678</a></span>.  But if no comparable common law right exists and no such constitutional or statutory interest has been created, relief is not available judicially.  Thus, at least unless capricious discrimination is asserted, there is no protected interest in contracting with the Government.  A litigant therefore has no standing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 341 U. S. 153</a></p><p> to object that an official has misinterpreted his instructions in requiring a particular clause to be included in a contract.  <em>Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/113/case.html">310 U. S. 113</a></span>.  Similarly, a determination whether the Government is within its powers in distributing electric power may be of enormous financial consequence to a private power company, but it has no standing to raise the issue.  <em>Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/118/case.html">306 U. S. 118</a></span>; <em>cf. Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/464/case.html">302 U. S. 464</a></span>.  The common law does not recognize an interest in freedom from honest competition; a court will give protection from competition by the Government, therefore, only when the Constitution or a statute creates such a right.</p>\n<p>(b) <em>Does the action challenged affect petitioner with sufficient "directness"?</em>  Frequently governmental action directly affects the legal interests of some person, and causes only a consequential detriment to another.  Whether the person consequentially harmed can challenge the action is said to depend on the "directness" of the impact of the action on him.  A shipper has no standing to attack a rate not applicable to him but merely affecting his previous competitive advantage over shippers subject to the rate.  <em>Hines Trustees v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/143/case.html">263 U. S. 143</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/143/case.html#148">263 U. S. 148</a></span>; <em>Sprunt &amp; Son v.

When those consequentially affected may resort to an administrative agency charged with their protection, courts are especially reluctant to give them "standing" to claim judicial review.  <em>See Atlanta v. Ickes,</em> 308 U.S. 517; <em>cf. Associated Industries v. Ickes,</em> 134 F.2d 694. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="154">Page 341 U. S. 154</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But it is not always true that only the person immediately affected can challenge the action.  The fact that an advantageous relationship is terminable at will does not prevent a litigant from asserting that improper interference with it gives him "standing" to assert a right of action.  <em>Hitchman Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/245/229/case.html">245 U. S. 229</a></span>.  On this principle, an alien employee was allowed to challenge a State law requiring his employer to discharge all but a specified proportion of alien employees, <em>Truax v. Raich,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/33/case.html">239 U.

The likelihood that the interests of the petitioner will be adequately protected by the person directly affected is a relevant consideration, <em>compare Columbia Broadcasting System v.

Although a litigant is the person most directly affected by the challenged action of the Government, he may not have "standing" to raise his objections in a court if the action has not, as it were, come to rest. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Courts do not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 341 U. S. 155</a></p><p> review issues, especially constitutional issues, until they have to.  <em>See Parker v. Los Angeles County, supra, and see</em> Brandeis, J., concurring in <em>Ashwander v.

In part, this practice reflects the tradition that courts, having final power, can exercise it most wisely by restricting themselves to situations in which decision is necessary.  In part, it is founded on the practical wisdom of not coming prematurely or needlessly in conflict with the executive or legislature.  <em>See Rochester Tel. Corp. v.

[<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The injury asserted in the cases at bar does not fall into any familiar category.  Petitioner in No. 8, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, is, according to its complaint, an unincorporated association engaged in relief work on behalf of Spanish Republican refugees.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 341 U. S. 158</a></p><p> Since its inception, it has distributed relief totaling $1,229,351; currently it is committed to regular monthly remittances of $5,400.  Its revenues have been obtained from public contributions, garnered largely at meetings and social functions.  The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, petitioner in No. 7, is a nonprofit membership corporation whose purpose is alleged to be to strengthen friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union by developing cultural relations "between the peoples of the two nations" and by disseminating in this country educational materials about Russia.  It has obtained its funds through public appeals and through collections at meetings.  Petitioner in No. 71 is the International Workers Order.  Its complaint states that it is a fraternal benefit society, comprising over 1,800 lodges, with assets totaling approximately $5,000,000.  Its members pay dues for the general expenses of the Order, and many of them make additional contributions for life, sickness and disability insurance.  In addition to its insurance activities, the Order</p>\n<p>"attempts to encourage the preservation of the cultural heritages and artistic values developed . . . by the peoples of the different countries of the world and brought with them to the United States."</p>\n<p>In November, 1947, each of these organizations was included in the list of groups designated by the Attorney General as within the provisions of Executive Order No. 9835, the President\'s Loyalty Order.  The list was disseminated to all departments and agencies of the Government.  Six months later, each was with more particularity labeled "communist."  Each alleges substantial injury as a consequence.  Publicity and meeting places have become difficult for the Refugee Committee and the Council to obtain.  The federal tax exemptions of all three organizations have been revoked; licenses necessary to solicitation of funds have been denied the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 341 U. S. 159</a></p><p> Refugee Committee; and the New York Superintendent of Insurance has begun proceedings, in which a representative of the Attorney General of the United States has appeared, for dissolution of the Order.  Most important, each of the organizations asserts that it has lost supporters and members, especially from present or prospective federal employees.  Claiming that the injury is irreparable, each asks for relief by way of a declaratory judgment and an injunction.</p>\n<p>The novelty of the injuries described in these petitions does not alter the fact that they present the characteristics which have in the past led this Court to recognize justiciability.  They are unlike claims which the courts have hitherto found incompatible with the judicial process.  No lack of finality can be urged.  Designation works an immediate substantial harm to the reputations of petitioners.  The threat which it carries for those members who are, or propose to become, federal employees makes it not a finicky or tenuous claim to object to the interference with their opportunities to retain or secure such employees as members.  The membership relation is as substantial as that protected in <em>Truax v. Raich</em> and <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra.</em>  And it is at least doubtful that the members could or would adequately present the organizations\' objections to the designation provisions of the Order.</p>\n<p>Only on the ground that the organizations assert no interest protected in analogous situations at common law, by statute, or by the Constitution, therefore, can plausible challenge to their "standing" here be made.  But the reasons which made an exercise of judicial power inappropriate in <em>Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA,</em> and <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, supra,</em> are not apposite here.  There, the injuries were such that, had they not been inflicted by the Government, they clearly could not have been redressed.  In <em>Perkins v. Lukens</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 341 U. S. 160</a></p><p> <em>Steel Co.,</em> it was not asserted that the authority under which the Government acted was invalid; only the correctness of an interpretation of a statute in the course of the exercise of an admitted power was challenged.  In the power cases, protection from competition was sought, but the thrust of the law is to preserve competition, not to give protection from it.  The action there challenged, furthermore, was not directed at named individuals.  Here, on the other hand, petitioners seek to challenge governmental action stigmatizing them individually.  They object not to a particular erroneous application of a valid power, but to the validity of the regulation authorizing the action.  They point to two types of injury, each of a sort which, were it not for principles of governmental immunity, would be clearly actionable at common law.</p>\n<p>This controversy is therefore amenable to the judicial process. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Its justiciability does not depend solely on the fact that the action challenged is defamatory.  Not every injury inflicted by a defamatory statement of a government officer can be redressed in court.  On the balance of all considerations, the exercise here of judicial power accords with traditional canons for access to courts without inroads on the effective conduct of government.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This brings us to the merits of the claims before the Court.  Petitioners are organizations which, on the face of the record, are engaged solely in charitable or insurance activities.  They have been designated "communist" by the Attorney General of the United States.  This designation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 341 U. S. 161</a></p><p> imposes no legal sanction on these organizations other than that it serves as evidence in ridding the Government of persons reasonably suspected of disloyalty.  It would be blindness, however, not to recognize that, in the conditions of our time, such designation drastically restricts the organizations, if it does not proscribe them.  Potential members, contributors or beneficiaries of listed organizations may well be influenced by use of the designation, for instance, as ground for rejection of applications for commissions in the armed forces or for permits for meetings in the auditoriums of public housing projects.  <em>Compare</em> Act of April 3, 1948, \xc2\xa7 110(c), 62 Stat. 143, 22 U.S.C. (Supp. III) \xc2\xa7 1508(c).  Yet designation has been made without notice, without disclosure of any reasons justifying it, without opportunity to meet the undisclosed evidence or suspicion on which designation may have been based, and without opportunity to establish affirmatively that the aims and acts of the organization are innocent.  It is claimed that thus to maim or decapitate, on the mere say-so of the Attorney General, an organization to all outward-seeming engaged in lawful objectives is so devoid of fundamental fairness as to offend the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Fairness of procedure is "due process in the primary sense."  <em>Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v.

S. 682</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The requirement of "due process" is not a fair-weather or timid assurance.  It must be respected in periods of calm and in times of trouble; it protects aliens as well as citizens.  But "due process," unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.  Expressing, as it does in its ultimate analysis, respect enforced by law for that feeling of just treatment which has been evolved through centuries of Anglo-American constitutional history and civilization, "due process" cannot be imprisoned within the treacherous limits of any formula.  Representing a profound attitude of fairness between man and man, and more particularly between the individual and government, "due process" is compounded of history, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="163">Page 341 U. S. 163</a></p><p> reason, the past course of decisions, and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess.  Due process is not a mechanical instrument.  It is not a yardstick.  It is a process.  It is a delicate process of adjustment inescapably involving the exercise of judgment by those whom the Constitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process.</p>\n<p>Fully aware of the enormous powers thus given to the judiciary, and especially to its Supreme Court, those who founded this Nation put their trust in a judiciary truly independent -- in judges not subject to the fears or allurements of a limited tenure and by the very nature of their function detached from passing and partisan influences.</p>\n<p>It may fairly be said that, barring only occasional and temporary lapses, this Court has not sought unduly to confine those who have the responsibility of governing by giving the great concept of due process doctrinaire scope.  The Court has responded to the infinite variety and perplexity of the tasks of government by recognizing that what is unfair in one situation may be fair in another.  <em>Compare, for instance,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/272/case.html">59 U. S. </a></span> Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.,</em> 18 How. 272, <em>with Ng Fung Ho v. White,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/276/case.html">259 U.

Whether the <em>ex parte</em> procedure to which the petitioners were subjected duly observed "the rudiments of fair play", <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co. v.

S. 168</a></span>, cannot, therefore, be tested by mere generalities or sentiments abstractly appealing.  The precise nature of the interest that has been adversely affected, the manner in which this was done, the reasons for doing it, the available alternatives to the procedure that was followed, the protection implicit in the office of the functionary whose conduct is challenged, the balance of hurt complained of and good accomplished -- these are some of the considerations that must enter into the judicial judgment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 341 U. S. 164</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Applying them to the immediate situation, we note that publicly designating an organization as within the proscribed categories of the Loyalty Order does not directly deprive anyone of liberty or property.  Weight must also be given to the fact that such designation is not made by a minor official, but by the highest law officer of the Government.  Again, it is fair to emphasize that the individual\'s interest is here to be weighed against a claim of the greatest of all public interests, that of national security.  In striking the balance, the relevant considerations must be fairly, which means coolly, weighed with due regard to the fact that this Court is not exercising a primary judgment, but is sitting in judgment upon those who also have taken the oath to observe the Constitution and who have the responsibility for carrying on government.</p>\n<p>But the significance we attach to general principles may turn the scale when competing claims appeal for supremacy.  Achievements of our civilization as precious as they were hard won were summarized by Mr. Justice Brandeis when he wrote that, "in the development of our liberty, insistence upon procedural regularity has been a large factor."  <em>Burdeau v. McDowell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/465/case.html">256 U. S. 465</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/477/case.html">256 U.

And so no one now doubts that, in the criminal law, a</p>\n<p>"person\'s right to reasonable notice of a charge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense -- a right to his day in court -- are basic in our system of jurisprudence."</p>\n<p><em>In re Oliver,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/257/case.html">333 U.

It is not true that the evils against which the Loyalty Order was directed are wholly devoid of analogy in our own history.  The circumstances attending the Napoleonic conflicts, which gave rise to the Sedition Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 596, readily come to mind.  But it is true that the executive action now under scrutiny is of a sort not heretofore challenged in this Court.  That, of itself, does not justify the <em>ex parte</em> summary designation procedure.  It does make it necessary to consider its validity when judged by our whole experience with the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The construction placed by this Court upon legislation conferring administrative powers shows consistent respect for a requirement of fair procedure before men are denied or deprived of rights.  From a great mass of cases, running the full gamut of control over property and liberty, there emerges the principle that statutes should be interpreted, if explicit language does not preclude, so as to observe due process in its basic meaning.  <em>See, e.g., Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/337/case.html">301 U. S. 337</a></span>; <em>American Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Fair hearings have been held essential for rate determinations [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>] and, generally, to deprive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 341 U.

[<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  An opportunity to be heard is constitutionally necessary to deport persons even though they make no claim of citizenship, and is accorded to aliens seeking entry in the absence of specific directions to the contrary.

S. 167</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The high social and moral values inherent in the procedural safeguard of a fair hearing are attested by the narrowness and rarity of the instances when we have sustained executive action even though it did not observe the customary standards of procedural fairness.  It is in these instances that constitutional compulsion regarding fair procedure was directly in issue.  Thus, it has been held that the Constitution cannot be invoked to prevent Congress from authorizing disbursements on the <em>ex parte</em> determination of an administrative officer that prescribed conditions are met.  <em>United States v. Babcock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/328/case.html">250 U. S. 328</a></span>; <em>cf. United States ex rel. Dunlap v.

Again, when decisions of administrative officers in execution of legislation turn exclusively on considerations similar to those on which the legislative body could itself have acted summarily, notice and hearing may not be commanded by the Constitution.  <em>Bi-Metallic Co. v.

Regard for this principle has guided Congress and the Executive.  Congress has often entrusted, as it may, protection of interests which it has created to administrative agencies, rather than to the courts.  But rarely has it authorized such agencies to act without those essential safeguards for fair judgment which in the course of centuries have come to be associated with due process.  <em>See Switchmen\'s Union v.

But, in other situations, an admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes becomes relevant.  "One has to remember that, when one\'s interest is keenly excited, evidence gathers from all sides around the magnetic point. . . ." [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  It should be particularly heeded at times of agitation and anxiety, when fear and suspicion impregnate the air we breathe.  <em>Compare</em> Brown, The French Revolution in English History.</p>\n<p>"The plea that evidence of guilt must be secret is abhorrent to free men, because it provides a cloak for the malevolent, the misinformed, the meddlesome, and the corrupt to play the role of informer undetected and uncorrected."</p>\n<p><em>United States ex rel.

Appearances in the dark are apt to look different in the light of day.</p>\n<p>Man, being what he is, cannot safely be trusted with complete immunity from outward responsibility in depriving others of their rights.  At least such is the conviction underlying our Bill of Rights.  That a conclusion satisfies one\'s private conscience does not attest its reliability.  The validity and moral authority of a conclusion largely depend on the mode by which it was reached.  Secrecy is not congenial to truthseeking, and self-righteousness gives too slender an assurance of rightness.  No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 341 U. S. 172</a></p><p> notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.  Nor has a better way been found for generating the feeling, so important to a popular government, that justice has been done. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The strength and significance of these considerations -- considerations which go to the very ethos of the scheme of our society -- give a ready answer to the problem before us.  That a hearing has been thought indispensable in so many other situations, leaving the cases of denial exceptional, does not of itself prove that it must be found essential here.  But it does place upon the Attorney General the burden of showing weighty reason for departing in this instance from a rule so deeply imbedded in history and in the demands of justice.  Nothing in the Loyalty Order requires him to deny organizations opportunity to present their case.  The Executive Order, defining his powers, directs only that designation shall be made "after appropriate investigation and determination."  This surely does not preclude an administrative procedure, however informal, which would incorporate the essentials of due process.  Nothing has been presented to the Court to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 341 U. S. 173</a></p><p> indicate that it will be impractical or prejudicial to a concrete public interest to disclose to organizations the nature of the case against them and to permit them to meet it if they can.  Indeed, such a contention could hardly be made, inasmuch as the Loyalty Order itself requires partial disclosure and hearing in proceedings against a Government employee who is a member of a proscribed organization.  Whether such procedure sufficiently protects the rights of the employee is a different story.  Such as it is, it affords evidence that the wholly summary process for the organizations is inadequate. [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>]  And we have controlling proof that Congress did not think that the Attorney General\'s procedure was indispensable for the protection of the public interest.  The McCarran Act, passed under circumstances certainly not more serene than when the Loyalty Order was issued, grants organizations a full administrative hearing, subject to judicial review, before they are required to register as "Communist action" or "Communist front." [<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]</p>\n<p>We are not here dealing with the grant of Government largess.  We have not before us the measured action of Congress, with the pause that is properly engendered when the validity of legislation is assailed.  The Attorney General is certainly not immune from the historic requirements of fairness merely because he acts, however conscientiously, in the name of security.  Nor does he obtain immunity on the ground that designation is not an "adjudication" or a "regulation" in the conventional use of those terms.  Due process is not confined in its scope to the particular forms in which rights have heretofore been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 341 U. S. 174</a></p><p> found to have been curtailed for want of procedural fairness.  Due process is perhaps the most majestic concept in our whole constitutional system.  While it contains the garnered wisdom of the past in assuring fundamental justice, it is also a living principle not confined to past instances.</p>\n<p>Therefore the petitioners did set forth causes of action which the District Court should have entertained.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The decisions are collected in the dissenting opinion in <em>Larson v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>While I join in the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BURTON, which would dispose of the cases on procedural grounds, the Court has decided them on the Constitution.  And so I turn to that aspect of the cases.</p>\n<p>The resolution of the constitutional question presents one of the gravest issues of this generation.  There is no doubt in my mind of the need for the Chief Executive and the Congress to take strong measures against any Fifth Column worming its way into government -- a Fifth Column that has access to vital information and the purpose to paralyze and confuse.  The problems of security are real.  So are the problems of freedom.  The paramount issue of the age is to reconcile the two.</p>\n<p>In days of great tension, when feelings run high, it is a temptation to take shortcuts by borrowing from the totalitarian techniques of our opponents.  But when we do, we set in motion a subversive influence of our own design that destroys us from within.  The present cases, together with No. 49, <em>Bailey v. Richardson,</em> 341 U.S. 918, affirmed today by an equally divided Court, are simple illustrations of that trend.</p>\n<p>I disagree with MR. JUSTICE JACKSON that an organization -- whether it be these petitioners, the American Red Cross, the Catholic Church, the Masonic Order, or the Boy Scouts -- has no standing to object to being labeled "subversive" in these <em>ex parte</em> proceedings.  The opinion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 341 U. S. 175</a></p><p> of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER disposes of that argument.  This is not an instance of name calling by public officials.  This is a determination of status -- a proceeding to ascertain whether the organization is or is not "subversive."  This determination has consequences that are serious to the condemned organizations.  Those consequences flow in part, of course, from public opinion.  But they also flow from actions of regulatory agencies that are moving in the wake of the Attorney General\'s determination to penalize or police these organizations. [<a href="#F4/1" name="T4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]  An organization branded as "subversive" by the Attorney General is maimed and crippled.  The injury is real, immediate, and incalculable.</p>\n<p>The requirements for fair trials under our system of government need no elaboration.  A party is entitled to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 341 U. S. 176</a></p><p> know the charge against him; he is also entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard.  Those principles were, in my opinion, violated here.</p>\n<p>The charge that these organizations are "subversive" could be clearly defined.  But how can anyone in the context of the Executive Order say what it means?  It apparently does not necessarily mean "totalitarian," "facist" or "communist," because they are separately listed.  Does it mean an organization with socialist ideas?  There are some who lump Socialists and Communists together.  Does it mean an organization that thinks the lot of some peasants has been improved under Soviet auspices?  Does it include an organization that is against the action of the United Nations in Korea?  Does it embrace a group which on some issues of international policy aligns itself with the Soviet viewpoint?  Does it mean a group which has unwittingly become the tool for Soviet propaganda?  Does it mean one into whose membership some Communists have infiltrated?  Or does it describe only an organization which, under the guise of honorable activities, serves as a front for Communist activities?</p>\n<p>No one can tell from the Executive Order what meaning is intended.  No one can tell from the records of the cases which one the Attorney General applied.  The charge is flexible; it will mean one thing to one officer, another to someone else.  It will be given meaning according to the predilections of the prosecutor; "subversive," to some, will be synonymous with "radical"; "subversive," to others, will be synonymous with "communist."  It can be expanded to include those who depart from the orthodox party line -- to those whose words and actions (though completely loyal) do not conform to the orthodox view on foreign or domestic policy.  These flexible standards, which vary with the mood or political philosophy of the prosecutor, are weapons which can be made as sharp or as blunt as the occasion requires.  Since they are subject </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 341 U. S. 177</a></p><p> to grave abuse, they have no place in our system of law.  When we employ them, we plant within our body politic the virus of the totalitarian ideology which we oppose.</p>\n<p>It is not enough to know that the men applying the standard are honorable and devoted men.  This is a government of <em>laws,</em> not of <em>men.</em>  The powers being used are the powers of government over the reputations and fortunes of citizens.  In situations far less severe or important than these, a party is told the nature of the charge against him.  Thus, when a defendant is summoned before a federal court to answer to a claim for damages or to a demand for an injunction against him, there must be a "plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  If that is necessary for even the most minor claim asserted against a defendant, we should require no less when it comes to determinations that may well destroy the group against whom the charge of being "subversive" is directed. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]  When the Government becomes the moving party, and levels its great powers against the citizen, it should be held to the same standards of fair dealing as we prescribe for other legal contests.  To let the Government adopt such lesser ones as suits the convenience of its officers is to start down the totalitarian path.</p>\n<p>The trend in that direction is only emphasized by the failure to give notice and hearing on the charges in these cases and by the procedure adopted in <em>Bailey v. Richardson, supra.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 341 U. S. 178</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Notice and opportunity to be heard are fundamental to due process of law.  We would reverse these cases out of hand if they were suits of a civil nature to establish a claim against petitioners.  Notice and opportunity to be heard are indispensable to a fair trial whether the case be criminal or civil.  <em>See Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/413/case.html">237 U. S. 413</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/413/case.html#424">237 U. S. 424</a></span>; <em>Palko v.

The gravity of the present charges is proof enough of the need for notice and hearing before the United States officially brands these organizations as "subversive."  No more critical governmental ruling can be made against an organization these days.  It condemns without trial.  It destroys without opportunity to be heard.  The condemnation may in each case be wholly justified.  But government in this country cannot, by edict, condemn or place beyond the pale.  The rudiments of justice, as we know it, call for notice and hearing -- an opportunity to appear and to rebut the charge.</p>\n<p>The system used to condemn these organizations is bad enough.  The evil is only compounded when a government employee is charged with being disloyal.  Association with or membership in an organization found to be "subversive" weighs heavily against the accused.  He is not allowed to prove that the charge against the organization is false.  That case is closed; that line of defense is taken away.  The technique is one of guilt by association -- one of the most odious institutions of history.  The fact that the technique of guilt by association was used in the prosecutions at Nuremberg [<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>] does not make it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="179">Page 341 U. S. 179</a></p><p> congenial to our constitutional scheme.  Guilt under our system of government is personal.  When we make guilt vicarious, we borrow from systems alien to ours, and ape our enemies.  Those short-cuts may at times seem to serve noble aims, but we depreciate ourselves by indulging in them.  When we deny even the most degraded person the rudiments of a fair trial, we endanger the liberties of everyone.  We set a pattern of conduct that is dangerously expansive, and is adaptable to the needs of any majority bent on suppressing opposition or dissension.</p>\n<p>It is not without significance that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights are procedural.  It is procedure that spells much of the difference between rule by law and rule by whim or caprice.  Steadfast adherence to strict procedural safeguards is our main assurance that there will be equal justice under law.  The case of Dorothy Bailey is an excellent illustration of how dangerous a departure from our constitutional standards can be.  She was charged with being a Communist and with being active in a Communist "front organization."  The Review Board stated that the case against her was based on reports, some of which came from "informants certified to us by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as experienced and entirely reliable." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 341 U. S. 180</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Counsel for Dorothy Bailey asked that their names be disclosed. That was refused.</p>\n<p>Counsel for Dorothy Bailey asked if these informants had been active in a certain union. The chairman replied, "I haven\'t the slightest knowledge as to who they were or how active they have been in anything."</p>\n<p>Counsel for Dorothy Bailey asked if those statements of the informants were under oath.  The chairman answered, "I don\'t think so."</p>\n<p>The Loyalty Board convicts on evidence which it cannot even appraise.  The critical evidence may be the word of an unknown witness who is "a paragon of veracity, a knave, or the village idiot." [<a href="#F4/5" name="T4/5">Footnote 4/5</a>]  His name, his reputation, his prejudices, his animosities, his trustworthiness are unknown both to the judge and to the accused.  The accused has no opportunity to show that the witness lied or was prejudiced or venal.  Without knowing who her accusers are, she has no way of defending.  She has nothing to offer except her own word and the character testimony of her friends.</p>\n<p>Dorothy Bailey was not, to be sure, faced with a criminal charge, and hence not technically entitled under the Sixth Amendment to be confronted with the witnesses against her.  But she was on trial for her reputation, her job, her professional standing.  A disloyalty trial is the most crucial event in the life of a public servant.  If condemned, he is branded for life as a person unworthy of trust or confidence.  To make that condemnation without meticulous regard for the decencies of a fair trial is abhorrent to fundamental justice.</p>\n<p>I do not mean to imply that, but for these irregularities, the system of loyalty trials is constitutional.  I do not see how the constitutionality of this dragnet system of loyalty trials which has been entrusted to the administrative agencies of government can be sustained.  Every government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 341 U. S. 181</a></p><p> employee must take an oath of loyalty. [<a href="#F4/6" name="T4/6">Footnote 4/6</a>]  If he swears falsely, he commits perjury, and can be tried in court.  In such a trial, he gets the full protection of the Bill of Rights, including trial by jury and the presumption of innocence.  I am inclined to the view that, when a disloyalty charge is substituted for perjury and an administrative board substituted for the court, "the spirit and the letter of the Bill of Rights" are offended. [<a href="#F4/7" name="T4/7">Footnote 4/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The problem of security is real, and the Government need not be paralyzed in handling it.  The security problem, however, relates only to those sensitive areas where secrets are or may be available, where critical policies are being formulated, or where sabotage can be committed.  The department heads must have leeway in handling their personnel problems in these sensitive areas.  The question is one of the fitness or qualifications of an individual for a particular position.  One can be transferred from those areas even when there is no more than a suspicion as to his loyalty.  We meet constitutional difficulties when the Government undertakes to punish by proclaiming the disloyalty of an employee and making him ineligible for any government post.  The British have avoided those difficulties by applying the loyalty procedure only in sensitive areas, and in using it to test the qualifications of an employee for a particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 341 U. S. 182</a></p><p> post, not to condemn him for all public employment. [<a href="#F4/8" name="T4/8">Footnote 4/8</a>]  When we go beyond that procedure and adopt the dragnet system now in force, we trench upon the civil rights of our people.  We condemn by administrative edict, rather than by jury trial. [<a href="#F4/9" name="T4/9">Footnote 4/9</a>]  Of course, no one has a constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 341 U. S. 183</a></p><p> right to a government job.  But every citizen has a right to a fair trial when his government seeks to deprive him of the privileges of first-class citizenship.</p>\n<p>The evil of these cases is only emphasized by the procedure employed in Dorothy Bailey\'s case.  Together, they illustrate how deprivation of our citizens of fair trials is subversion from within.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue canceled the tax-exempt status of contributions to eight "subversive" organizations shortly after the Attorney General\'s list was released.  The Bureau\'s announcement of the revocation indicated that the listing provided the basis for it.  Treasury Dept.

JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate that this Court should flounder in wordy disagreement over the validity and effect of procedures which have already been pursued for several years.  The extravagance of some of the views expressed and the intemperance of their statement may create a suspicion that the decision of the case does not rise above the political controversy that engendered it.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and those for whom he speaks, would rescue the Loyalty Order from inquiry as to its validity by spelling out an admission by the Attorney General that it has been arbitrarily misapplied.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK would have us hold that listing by the Attorney General of organizations alleged to be subversive is the equivalent of a bill of attainder for treason after the fashion of those of the Stuart kings, while MR. JUSTICE REED contends, in substance, that the designation is a mere press release without legal consequences.</p>\n<p>If the Court agreed that an accused employee could challenge the designation, its effect would be only advisory or <em>prima facie;</em> but, as I point out later, the Court refuses so to limit the effect of the designation.  In view of these and other diversified opinions, none of which has attracted sufficient adherents for a Court and none of which I can fully accept, I shall state rather than argue my view of the matter.</p>\n<p>1. <em>The Loyalty Order does affect substantive legal rights.</em> -- I agree that mere designation as subversive deprives </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 341 U. S. 184</a></p><p> the organizations themselves of no legal right or immunity.  By it, they are not dissolved, subjected to any legal prosecution, punished, penalized, or prohibited from carrying on any of their activities.  Their claim of injury is that they cannot attract audiences, enlist members, or obtain contributions as readily as before.  These, however, are sanctions applied by public disapproval, not by law.  It is quite true that the popular censure is focused upon them by the Attorney General\'s characterization.  But the right of privacy does not extend to organized groups or associations which solicit funds or memberships or to corporations dependent upon the state for their charters. [<a href="#F5/1" name="T5/1">Footnote 5/1</a>]  The right of individuals to assemble is one thing; the claim that an organization of secret undisclosed character may conduct public drives for funds or memberships is another.  They may be free to solicit, propagandize, and hold meetings, but they are not free from public criticism or exposure.  If the only effect of the Loyalty Order was that suffered by the organizations, I should think their right to relief very dubious.</p>\n<p>But the real target of all this procedure is the government employee who is a member of, or sympathetic to, one or more accused organizations.  He not only may be discharged, but disqualified from employment, upon no other ground than such membership or sympathetic affiliation.  And he cannot attack the correctness of the Attorney General\'s designation in any loyalty proceeding.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.  That the safeguard of a hearing would not defeat the effectiveness of a Loyalty Program is apparently the judgment of Congress and of State Legislatures, for, as he points out, both congressional and state loyalty legislation recognize the right.</p>\n<p>3. <em>The organizations may vindicate unconstitutional deprivation of members\' rights.</em> -- There are two stages at which administrative hearings could protect individuals\' legal rights -- one is before an organization is designated as subversive, the other is when the individual, because of membership, is accused of disloyalty.  Either choice might be a permissible solution of a difficult problem inherent in such an extensive program.  But an equally divided Court today, erroneously, I think, rejects the claim that the individual has hearing rights. [<a href="#F5/6" name="T5/6">Footnote 5/6</a>]  I am unable to comprehend the process by which those who think the Attorney General\'s designation is no more than a press release can foreclose attack upon it in the employees\' case.  Also beyond my understanding is how a Court whose collective opinion is that the designations are subject to judicial inquiry can, at the same time, say that a discharge based at least in part on them is not.</p>\n<p>By the procedures of this Loyalty Order, both groups and individuals may be labeled disloyal and subversive.  The Court grants judicial review and relief to the group, while refusing it to the individual.  So far as I recall, this is the first time this Court has held rights of individuals subordinate and inferior to those of organized groups.  I think that is an inverted view of the law -- it is justice turned bottom-side up. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 341 U.

The only practical judicial policy when people pool their capital, their interests, or their activities under a name and form that will identify collective interests often is to permit the association or corporation in a single case to vindicate the interests of all.</p>\n<p>This procedure is appropriate here, where the Government has lumped all the members\' interests in the organization, so that condemnation of the one will reach all.  The Government proceeds on the basis that each of these associations is so identical with its members that the subversive purpose and intents of the one may be attributed to and made conclusive upon the other.  Having adopted this procedure in the Executive Department, I think the Government can hardly ask the Judicial Department to deny the standing of the organizations to vindicate its members\' rights.</p>\n<p>Unless a hearing is provided in which the organization can present evidence as to its character, a presumption of disloyalty is entered against its every member employee, and, because of it, he may be branded disloyal, discharged, and rendered ineligible for government service.

This list included the three above-named organizations.  The Board promptly disseminated the information to all departments and agencies.  It was published as Appendix A to Title 5, Administrative Personnel, CFR \xc2\xa7 210.11(b)(6).  13 Fed.Reg. 1471.  Later, September 17, 1948, the three organizations were designated by the Attorney General as "communist."  13 Fed.Reg. 6135.

The method of dealing with communism and communists adopted by the Commonwealth of Australia was held beyond the powers of that government.  <em>Australian Communist Party v. Commonwealth,</em> decision of Friday, March 9, 1951, 83 C.L.R. 1.</l=|341></p>\n<p>The procedure for designating these petitioners as communists may be summarized as follows:  Executive Order No. 9835, Part III, was issued by the President as Chief Executive, "in the interest of the internal management of the Government" and under the Civil Service Act of 1883, 22 Stat. 403, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 632 <em>et seq.,</em> and \xc2\xa7 9A of the Hatch Act. 5 U.S.C.Supp. II, \xc2\xa7 118j.  The former acts give general regulatory powers over the employment and discharge of government personnel; the latter is more specific. [<a href="#F6/1" name="T6/1">Footnote 6/1</a>]  These present cases do not involve the removal of any employee.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 341 U. S. 190</a></p><p> The Order required investigation of the loyalty of applicants for government employment and similar investigation of present employees.  To assure uniformity and fairness throughout the Government in the investigation of employees, a Loyalty Review Board was created to review loyalty cases from any department or agency, disseminate information pertinent to employee loyalty programs, and advise the heads thereof.  Standards were provided for employment and discharge.  So far as pertinent to the objections of petitioner to inclusion on the list of subversive and communist organizations, they appear in <l=|341 123fn6="" 3|="" u.s.="">note 3 and in the note below. [<a href="#F6/2" name="T6/2">Footnote 6/2</a>]  It was apparently to avoid the necessity of continuous reexamination by all government departments and agencies of the characteristics of organizations suspected of aims inimical to the Government that provision was made in the Order for examination and designation of such organizations by </l=|341></p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 341 U. S. 191</a></p><p> the Attorney General.  12 Fed.Reg. 1938, Part III, \xc2\xa7 3. [<a href="#F6/3" name="T6/3">Footnote 6/3</a>]  It was under this plan that the Attorney General made his designations.</p>\n<p>The designations made available for the use of the Loyalty Review Board and the departmental or agency loyalty boards, the result of the investigation of the Attorney General into the character of organizations that might fall under suspicion as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive.  The list does not furnish a basis for any court action against the organizations so designated.  It, of course, might follow from discovery of facts by the investigation that criminal or civil proceedings would be begun to enforce an applicable criminal statute or to cancel the franchise or some license of a listed organization.  In such a proceeding, however, the accused organization would have the usual protections of any defendant.  The list is evidence only of the character of the listed organizations in proceedings before loyalty boards to determine whether "reasonable" grounds exist for belief "that the employee under consideration" is disloyal to the Government of the United States.  <em>See</em> <l=|341 123fn6="" 2|="" u.s.="">note 2, <em>supra.</em>  The names were placed on the list by the Attorney General after investigation.  If legally permissible, as carried out by the Attorney General, there is no question but that a single investigation as to the character of </l=|341></p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 341 U. S. 192</a></p><p> an organization is preferable to one by each of the more than a hundred agencies of government that are catalogued in the United States Government Organization Manual.  To require a determination as to each organization for the administrative hearing of each employee investigated for disloyalty would be impossible.  The employee\'s association with a listed organization does not, under the Order, establish, even <em>prima facie,</em> reasonable grounds for belief in the employee\'s disloyalty. [<a href="#F6/4" name="T6/4">Footnote 6/4</a>]</p>\n<p>None of the complaints denies that the Attorney General made an "investigation" of the organizations to determine whether or not they were totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive as required by Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, or that he had material information concerning disloyal activities on their part.  The Council came the nearest to such an allegation in the quoted excerpts from their complaint in <l=|341 10|="" 123fn6="" u.s.="">note 10, but we read them as no more than allegations of unconstitutionality because "investigation" without notice and hearing is not "appropriate."  Certainly there is no specific allegation of the way in which the Attorney General failed to follow the Order.  We therefore assume that the designation was made after appropriate investigation and determination. [<a href="#F6/5" name="T6/5">Footnote 6/5</a>] </l=|341></p><p><a class="page-number" name="193">Page 341 U. S. 193</a></p><p></p>\n<p>No objection is or could reasonably be made in the records or briefs to an examination by the Government into the loyalty of its employees.  Although the Founders of this Republic rebelled against their established government of England and won our freedom, the creation of our own constitutional government endowed that new government, the United States of America, with the right and duty to protect its existence against any force that seeks its overthrow or changes in its structure by other than constitutional means.  Tolerant as we are of all political efforts by argument or persuasion to change the basis of our social, economic or political life, the line is drawn sharply and clearly at any act or incitement to act in violation of our constitutional processes.  Surely the Government need not await an employee\'s conviction of a crime involving disloyalty before separating him from public service.  Governments cannot be indifferent to manifestations of subversion.  As soon as these are significant enough reasonably to cause concern as to the likelihood of action, the duty to protect the state compels the exertion of governmental power.  Not to move would brand a government with a dangerous weakness of will.  The determination of the time for action rests with the executive and legislature arms.  An objection to consideration of an employee\'s sympathetic association with an admitted totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive group, as bearing upon the propriety of his retention or employment as a government employee, would have no better standing.  The Order gives conclusive indication of the type of organization that is meant by the four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="194">Page 341 U. S. 194</a></p><p> word-labels. [<a href="#F6/6" name="T6/6">Footnote 6/6</a>]  Following them in Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, 12 Fed.Reg. 1938, are the words,</p>\n<p>"or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means."</p>\n<p>Bracketed with membership in listed organizations (Exec.Order No. 9835, Part V) as activities for consideration in determining an employee\'s loyalty are those listed below.  These are the standards that define the type of organization subject to designation. [<a href="#F6/7" name="T6/7">Footnote 6/7</a>]  Of course, the Order means that a communist or subversive organization is of the same general character as one that seeks to alter our form of government by unconstitutional means, 13 Fed.Reg. 6137, to-wit, by force and violence.</p>\n<p>Procedure under the Executive Order does not require "proof" in the sense of a court proceeding that these communist organizations teach or incite to force and violence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 341 U. S. 195</a></p><p> to obtain their objectives. [<a href="#F6/8" name="T6/8">Footnote 6/8</a>]  What is required by the Order is an examination and determination by the Attorney General that these organizations are "communist."  The description "communist" is adequate for the purposes of inquiry and listing.  No such precision of definition is necessary as a criminal prosecution might require.  <em>Cf. United States v. Chemical Foundation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/1/case.html">272 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/1/case.html#14">272 U. S. 14</a></span>.  Communism is well understood to mean a group seeking to overthrow by force and violence governments such as ours and to establish a new government based on public ownership and direction of productive property.  Undoubtedly, there are reasonable grounds to conclude that accepted history teaches that revolution by force and violence to accomplish this end is a tenet of communists. [<a href="#F6/9" name="T6/9">Footnote 6/9</a>]  No more is necessary to justify an organization\'s designation as communist. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 341 U. S. 196</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As a basis for petitioners\' attack on the list, the Refugee Committee set forth facts in its complaint to show its charitable character.  These indicate activities and expenditures in aid of the Spanish Republicans in flight from their homeland.  The International Workers Order sets forth facts to show that it was a duly organized fraternal benefit society under New York law, furnishing sickness and death benefits as well as life insurance protection to its members.  It states other worthy objectives in which it is engaged, and asserts it is not an organization such as are referred to in the Order, Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, <em>supra.</em>  The Council, too, sets out its purpose to promote American-Soviet friendship by means of education and information.  It asserts:</p>\n<p>"In all its activities, the National Council has sought to further the best interests of the American people by lawful, peaceful and constitutional means."</p>\n<p>The absence of any provision in the Order or rules for notice to suspected organizations, for hearings with privilege to the organizations to confront witnesses, cross-examine, produce evidence, and have representation of counsel or judicial review of the conclusion reached by the Attorney General is urged by the petitioners as a procedure so fundamentally unfair and restrictive of personal freedoms as to violate the Federal Constitution, specifically the Due Process Clause and the First Amendment.  No opportunity was allowed by the Attorney General for petitioners to offer proof of the legality of their purposes or to disprove charges of subversive operations.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 341 U. S. 197</a></p><p> This is the real gravamen of each complaint, the basis upon which the determination of unconstitutionality is sought. [<a href="#F6/10" name="T6/10">Footnote 6/10</a>]</p>\n<p>To these complaints, the Government filed motions to dismiss because of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The motions were granted by the District Court, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>Admissions by motions to dismiss.</em> -- It is held in MR. JUSTICE BURTON\'s opinion that the motion to dismiss should have been denied.  It is said:</p>\n<p>"The inclusion of any of the complaining organizations in the designated list solely on the facts alleged in the respective complaints, which must be the basis for our decision here, is therefore an arbitrary and unauthorized act.  In the two cases where the complaint specifically alleges the factual absence of any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 341 U. S. 198</a></p><p> basis for the designation, and the respondents\' motion admits that allegation, the designation is necessarily contrary to the record."</p>\n<p>P.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/123/case.html#137">341 U. S. 137</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I understand MR. JUSTICE BURTON\'s opinion to hold that, as a motion to strike for failure to state a cause of action admits all well pleaded facts, respondents\' motion admits such allegations in the complaint as that quoted in the third preceding paragraph from the Council\'s complaint and the assertions that petitioners are not "totalitarian, facist, communist or subversive."  Such statements, however, appear to me to be only conclusions of law as to the effect of facts stated, or empty assertions or conclusions without well pleaded facts to sustain them. [<a href="#F6/11" name="T6/11">Footnote 6/11</a>]  Where the issue is the permissibility of designation without notice or hearing, a motion to strike does not admit an allegation of "arbitrary" action, or that "all its activities (are) . . . constitutional."  These complaints may not be decided upon any such posture in pleading.  Petitioners\' charge, that their "designation" violates due process and the First Amendment, remains the issue.</p>\n<p><em>Standing to sue.</em> -- A question is raised by the United States as to petitioners\' standing to maintain these actions.  It seems unnecessary to analyze that problem in this dissent.  If there should be a determination that petitioners\' constitutional rights are violated by petitioners\' designation under Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, of the Order, it would seem they would have standing to seek redress.  The "standing" turns on the existence of the federal right. [<a href="#F6/12" name="T6/12">Footnote 6/12</a>]  Does petitioners\' designation abridge their rights under the First Amendment?  Do petitioners have a constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 341 U. S. 199</a></p><p> Amendment to require a hearing before the Attorney General designates them as a subversive or communist organization for the purposes of Executive Order No. 9835?</p>\n<p><em>First Amendment.</em> -- Petitioners assert that their inclusion on the disloyal list has abridged their freedom of speech, since listeners or readers are more difficult to obtain for their speeches and publications, and parties interested in their work are more hesitant to become associates.  The Refugee Committee brief adds that "thought" is also abridged.  A concurring opinion accepts these arguments to the point of concluding that the publication of the lists "with or without a hearing" violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>This Court, throughout the years, has maintained the protection of the First Amendment as a major safeguard to the maintenance of a free republic.  This Nation has never suffered from an enforced conformity of expression or a limitation of criticism.  But neither are we compelled to endure espionage and sedition.  Wide as are the freedoms of the First Amendment, this Court has never hesitated to deny the individual\'s right to use the privileges for the overturn of law and order.  Reasonable restraints for the fair protection of the Government against incitement to sedition cannot properly be said to be "undemocratic" or contrary to the guarantees of free speech.  Otherwise, the guarantee of civil rights would be a mockery. [<a href="#F6/13" name="T6/13">Footnote 6/13</a>]  Even when this Court spoke out most strongly against previous restraints, it was careful to recognize that</p>\n<p>"The security of the community life may be protected against incitements to acts of violence and the overthrow by force of orderly government."</p>\n<p><em>Near v.

S. 200</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Recognizing that the designation, rightly or wrongly, of petitioner organizations as communist impairs their ability to carry forward successfully whatever legitimate objects they seek to accomplish, we do not accept their argument that such interference is an abridgment of First Amendment guarantees. [<a href="#F6/14" name="T6/14">Footnote 6/14</a>]  They are in the position of every proponent of unpopular views.  Heresy induces strong expressions of opposition.  So long as petitioners are permitted to voice their political ideas, free from suggestions for the opportune use of force to accomplish their social and economic aims, it is hard to understand how any advocate of freedom of expression can assert that their right has been unconstitutionally abridged.  As nothing in the orders or regulations concerning this list limits the teachings or support of these organizations, we do not believe that any right of theirs under the First Amendment is abridged by publication of the list.</p>\n<p><em>Due Process.</em> -- This point brings us face to face with the argument that, whether the Attorney General was right or wrong in listing these organizations, his designation cannot stand because a final decision of ineligibility for employment without notice and hearing rises to the importance of a constitutional defect.  If standards for definition of organizations includable on the list are necessary, the order furnishes adequate tests, as appears from the text preceding notes <l=|341 123fn6="" 2|="" u.s.="">2 and <l=|341 123fn6="" 7|="" u.s.="">7 above and the standards set out in those notes.  <em>Compare</em> cases cited, <l=|341 123fn6="" 6|="" u.s.="">note 6, <em>supra.</em></l=|341></l=|341></l=|341></p>\n<p>Does due process require notice and hearing for the Department of Justice investigation under Executive Order No. 9835, Part III, \xc2\xa7 3, note 3, <em>supra,</em> preliminary to listing?

S. 201</a></p><p> notice and hearing as fairness requires.  This is my understanding of the meaning of the opinions upon due process cited in the concurring opinions.

[<a href="#F6/15" name="T6/15">Footnote 6/15</a>]  They were given no chance to take part.  Their claim is that the listing resulted in a deprivation of liberty or property contrary to the procedure required by the Fifth Amendment.

S. 202</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The contention can be answered summarily by saying that there is no deprivation of any property or liberty of any listed organization by the Attorney General\'s designation.  It may be assumed that the listing is hurtful to their prestige, reputation and earning power.  It may be such an injury as would entitle organizations to damages in a tort action against persons not protected by privilege.  <em>See Spalding v.

The President and the Attorney General pointed this out. [<a href="#F6/23" name="T6/23">Footnote 6/23</a>]  It is written into the Code of Federal Regulations, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 341 U.

It is suggested by one concurrence that, as the</p>\n<p>"Government proceeds on the basis that each of these associations is so identical with its members that the subversive purpose and intents of the one may be attributed to and made conclusive upon the other,"</p>\n<p>the organization must be permitted to vindicate the members\' rights or due process is not satisfied.  Another concurrence states "an employee may lose his job because of the Attorney General\'s secret and <em>ex parte</em> action."  Both concurrences indicate, it seems to me, that, as a member of petitioner organizations is denied due process by the effect of listing the organizations, the organization is likewise denied due process in the listing.  Without accepting the logic of the concurrences, and waiving inquiry as to the standing of a corporation or unincorporated association to defend the rights of a member to employment, we think the suggestions as to lack of due process are based on an erroneous premise.  Employees generally, under executive departments and agencies, whether or not members of listed organizations, without special statutory protection such as permanent employees under the competitive and classified civil service laws and regulations or preference eligibles under the Veterans\' Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 387, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 851, 5 CFR, Parts 9 and 22, and Part 2, \xc2\xa7 2.104, are subject to summary removal by the appointing officers. [<a href="#F6/24" name="T6/24">Footnote 6/24</a>]  Listing of these organizations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 341 U. S. 207</a></p><p> does not conclude the members\' rights to hold government employment.  It is only one piece of evidence for consideration. [<a href="#F6/25" name="T6/25">Footnote 6/25</a>]  That mere membership in listed organizations does not normally bring about findings of disloyalty is graphically shown by a report of proceedings under the loyalty program. [<a href="#F6/26" name="T6/26">Footnote 6/26</a>]  The procedure for removal of employees suspected of disloyalty follows the routine prescribed for the removal of employees on other grounds for dismissal.  Employees under investigation have never had the right to confrontation, cross-examination and <em>quasi</em>-judicial hearing. 37 Stat. 555, as amended, 5 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 341 U. S. 208</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 652.  Normal removal procedure functions for permanent employees about in this way.  The employing agency may remove for the efficiency of the service, including grounds for disqualification of an applicant.  5 CFR, 1947 Supp. \xc2\xa7 9.101. [<a href="#F6/27" name="T6/27">Footnote 6/27</a>]  Removal requires notice and charges. [<a href="#F6/28" name="T6/28">Footnote 6/28</a>]  Before the loyalty review boards, similar procedure is followed. [<a href="#F6/29" name="T6/29">Footnote 6/29</a>]  Where initial consideration indicates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 341 U. S. 209</a></p><p> a removal of an incumbent for disloyalty may be warranted, notice is provided for. [<a href="#F6/30" name="T6/30">Footnote 6/30</a>]  Thus, there is scrupulous care taken to see that an employee who has fallen under suspicion has notice of the charges and an opportunity to explain his actions.  The employee has no opportunity to disprove the characterization placed upon the listed organization by the Attorney General for the practical reasons stated following <l=|341 123fn6="" 2|="" u.s.="">note 2, <em>supra.</em>  The employee does have every opportunity to explain his association with that organization.  The Constitution requires for the employee no more than this fair opportunity to explain his questioned activities.  Such procedure is quite similar to that followed in Great </l=|341></p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 341 U. S. 210</a></p><p> Britain in the removal or transfer of civil servants from positions "vital to the security of the State."  The Prime Minister assumed the authority to designate membership in the Communist Party or "other forms of continuing association" therewith as sufficient to bar employment in sensitive areas. [<a href="#F6/31" name="T6/31">Footnote 6/31</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Conclusion.</em> -- In our judgment, organizations are not affected by these designations in such a manner as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 341 U. S. 211</a></p><p> permit a court\'s interference or to deny due process.  That conclusion holds good also when we assume the organizations may present their members\' grievances over discharge as a part of the organization\'s case.  The administrative hearing granted an employee facing discharge is a statutory modification of the employing agent\'s former authority to discharge summarily.  Such act or grace does not create a constitutional right.  Due process is called for in determinations affecting rights.</p>\n<p>What petitioners seek is a ruling that the Government cannot designate organizations as communist for the purpose of furthering investigations into employees\' loyalty by the employing agencies without giving those organizations an opportunity to examine and meet the information on which the list is based.  One can understand that position.  There is a natural hesitation against any action that may damage any person or organization through an error that notice and hearing might correct.  Such attitude of tolerance is reflected in \xc2\xa7 13 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, 998.  A statutory requirement for notice and administrative hearing, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="212">Page 341 U. S. 212</a></p><p> does not mean the existence of a constitutional requirement. [<a href="#F6/32" name="T6/32">Footnote 6/32</a>]</p>\n<p>The Executive has authority to gather information concerning the loyalty of its employees, as congressional committees have power to investigate matters of legislative interest.  A public statement of legislative conclusions on information that later may be found erroneous may damage those investigated, but it is not a civil judgment or a criminal conviction.  Due process does not apply.  Questions of propriety of political action are not for the courts.  Information that an employee associates with or belongs to organizations considered communistic may be deemed by the Executive a sound reason for making inquiries into the desirability of the employment of that employee.  That is not "guilt by association."  It is a warning to investigate the conduct of the employee and his opportunity for harm.</p>\n<p>While we must be on guard against being moved to conclusions on the constitutionality of action, legislative or executive, by the circumstances of the moment, undoubtedly varying conditions call for differences in procedure.  Due process requires appraisal in the light of conditions confronting the executive during the continuation of the challenged action. [<a href="#F6/33" name="T6/33">Footnote 6/33</a>]  Power lies in the executive to guard the Nation from espionage, subversion and sedition by examining into the loyalty of employees, and due process in such investigation depends upon the particular exercise of that power in particular conditions. [<a href="#F6/34" name="T6/34">Footnote 6/34</a>]  In investigations to determine the purposes of suspected organizations, the Government should be free to proceed without notice or hearing.
