The survey convinced the Tribe that about an acre of its land lay on the other side of a boundary fence between its land and land owned by Sharline and Ray Lundgren.  The Lundgrens filed a quiet title action in Washington state court, invoking the doctrines of adverse possession and mutual acquiescence, but the Tribe asserted sovereign immunity from the suit.  Ultimately, the State Supreme Court rejected the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s immunity claim and ruled for the Lundgrens, reasoning that, under <i>County of Yakima</i> v. <i>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,</i>\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 251, tribal sovereign immunity does not apply to <i>in rem</i> suits.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: <i>Yakima</i> addressed not the scope of tribal sovereign immunity, but a question of statutory interpretation of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887.  That Act authorized the President to allot parcels of reservation land to individual tribal members and directed the United States eventually to issue fee patents to the allottees as private individuals.  In 1934, Congress reversed course but made no attempt to withdraw the lands already conveyed.  As a result, Indian reservations sometimes contain both trust land held by the United States and fee-patented land held by private parties.  <i>Yakima</i> concerned the tax consequences of this intermixture.  This Court had previously held that \xc2\xa76 of the General Allotment Act could no longer be read as allowing States to impose <i>in personam</i> taxes on transactions between Indians on fee-patented land within a reservation.  <i>Moe</i> v. <i>Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation,</i>\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463, 479\xe2\x80\x93481.  The Court reached a different conclusion in <i>Yakima </i>with respect to <i>in rem</i> state taxes, holding that the state collection of property taxes on fee-patented land within reservations was still allowed under \xc2\xa76.  502 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 265.  In short, <i>Yakima</i> sought only to interpret a relic of a statute in light of a distinguishable precedent; it resolved nothing about the law of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Acknowledging this, the Lundgrens now ask the Court to affirm on an alternative, common-law ground: that the Tribe cannot assert sovereign immunity because this suit relates to immovable property located in Washington State, purchased by the Tribe in the same manner as a private individual.  Because this alternative argument did not emerge until late in this case, the Washington Supreme Court should address it in the first instance.

Some think it means Indian tribes lack sovereign immunity in <i>in\xc2\xa0rem</i> lawsuits like this one; others don\xe2\x80\x99t read it that way at all.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]*  We granted certiorari to set things straight.  583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p><p>Ancestors of the Upper Skagit Tribe lived for centuries along the Skagit River in northwestern Washington State.  But as settlers moved across the Cascades and into the region, the federal government sought to make room for them by displacing native tribes.  In the treaty that followed with representatives of the Skagit people and others, the tribes agreed to \xe2\x80\x9ccede, relinquish, and convey\xe2\x80\x9d their lands to the United States in return for $150,000 and other promises.  Treaty of Point Elliott, Jan. 22, 1855,12Stat.927; see <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.</i>,443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 658, 676 (1979); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Washington</i>, 384 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 312, 333 (WD Wash. 1974).</p><p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s dispute stems from the Upper Skagit Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to recover a portion of the land it lost.  In 1981, the federal government set aside a small reservation for the Tribe.  46 Fed. Reg. 46681.  More recently, the Tribe has sought to purchase additional tracts in market transactions.  In 2013, the Tribe bought roughly 40 acres where, it says, tribal members who died of smallpox are buried.  The Tribe bought the property with an eye to asking the federal government to take the land into trust and add it to the existing reservation next door.  See25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75108; 25 CFR \xc2\xa7151.4 (2013).  Toward that end, the Tribe commissioned a survey of the plot so it could confirm the property\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.  But then a question arose.</p><p>The problem was a barbed wire fence.  The fence runs some 1,300 feet along the boundary separating the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s land from land owned by its neighbors, Sharline and Ray Lundgren.  The survey convinced the Tribe that the fence is in the wrong place, leaving about an acre of its land on the Lundgrens\xe2\x80\x99 side.  So the Tribe informed its new neighbors that it intended to tear down the fence; clearcut the intervening acre; and build a new fence in the right spot.</p><p>In response, the Lundgrens filed this quiet title action in Washington state court.  Invoking the doctrines of adverse possession and mutual acquiescence, the Lundgrens offered evidence showing that the fence has stood in the same place for years, that they have treated the disputed acre as their own, and that the previous owner of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s tract long ago accepted the Lundrens\xe2\x80\x99 claim to the land lying on their side of the fence.  For its part, the Tribe asserted sovereign immunity from the suit.  It relied upon the many decisions of this Court recognizing the sovereign authority of Native American tribes and their right to \xe2\x80\x9cthe common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Michigan </i>v. <i>Bay Mills Indian Community</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Washington rejected the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s claim of immunity and ruled for the Lundgrens.  The court reasoned that sovereign immunity does not apply to cases where a judge \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[es] in rem jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to quiet title in a parcel of land owned by a Tribe, but only to cases where a judge seeks to exercise <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over the Tribe itself.  187 Wash. 2d 857, 867, 389 P.\xc2\xa03d 569, 573 (2017).  In coming to this conclusion, the court relied in part on our decision in <i>Yakima</i>.  Like some courts before it, the Washington Supreme Court read <i>Yakima</i> as distinguishing <i>in\xc2\xa0rem</i> from <i>in personam</i> lawsuits and \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ing] the principle that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts have subject matter jurisdiction over in\xc2\xa0rem proceedings in certain situations where claims of sovereign immunity are asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  187 Wash. 2d, at 868, 389 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 574.</p><p>That was error.  <i>Yakima</i> did not address the scope of tribal sovereign immunity.  Instead, it involved only a much more prosaic question of statutory interpretation concerning the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887.  See24Stat.388.</p><p>Some background helps dispel the misunderstanding.  The General Allotment Act represented part of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s late Nineteenth Century Indian policy: \xe2\x80\x9cto extinguish tribal sovereignty, erase reservation boundaries, and force the assimilation of Indians into the society at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yakima</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 254; <i>In re Heff</i>,197 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488, 499 (1905).  It authorized the President to allot parcels of reservation land to individual tribal members.  The law then directed the United States to hold the allotted parcel in trust for some years, and afterwards issue a fee patent to the allottee.24Stat.389.  Section 6 of the Act, as amended, provided that once a fee patent issued, \xe2\x80\x9ceach and every allottee shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or Territory in which they may reside\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7349.</p><p>In 1934, Congress reversed course.  It enacted the Indian Reorganization Act,48Stat.984, to restore \xe2\x80\x9cthe principles of tribal self-determination and self-governance\xe2\x80\x9d that prevailed before the General Allotment Act.  <i>Yakima</i>, 502 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress halted further allotments and extended indefinitely the existing periods of trust applicable to\xe2\x80\x9d parcels that were not yet fee patented.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see 25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7461\xe2\x80\x93462.  But the Legislature made no attempt to withdraw lands already conveyed to private persons through fee patents (and by now sometimes conveyed to non-Indians).  As a result, Indian reservations today sometimes contain two kinds of land intermixed in a kind of checkerboard pattern: trust land held by the United States and fee-patented land held by private parties.  See <i>Yakima, supra</i>, at 256.</p><p><i>Yakima</i> concerned the tax consequences of this checkerboard.  Recall that the amended version of \xc2\xa76 of the General Allotment Act rendered allottees and their fee-patented land subject to state regulations and taxes.25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7349.  Despite that, in <i>Moe</i> v. <i>Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463 (1976), this Court held that \xc2\xa76 could no longer be read as allowing States to impose <i>in personam</i> taxes (like those on cigarette sales) on transactions between Indians on fee-patented land within a reservation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 479\xe2\x80\x93481.  Among other things, the Court pointed to the impracticality of using the ownership of a particular parcel within a reservation to determine the law governing transactions taking place upon it.  See <i>id.,</i> at 478\xe2\x80\x93479.  Despite <i>Moe</i> and some years later, this Court in <i>Yakima</i> reached a different conclusion with respect to <i>in\xc2\xa0rem</i> state taxes.  The Court held that allowing States to collect property taxes on fee-patented land within reservations was still allowed by \xc2\xa76.  <i>Yakima</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 265.  Unlike the <i>in personam</i> taxes condemned in <i>Moe</i>, the Court held that imposing <i>in\xc2\xa0rem</i> taxes only on the fee-patented squares of the checkerboard was \xe2\x80\x9cnot impracticable\xe2\x80\x9d because property tax assessors make \xe2\x80\x9cparcel-by-parcel determinations\xe2\x80\x9d about property tax liability all the time.  <i>Yakima</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 265<i>.</i>  In short, <i>Yakima</i> sought only to interpret a relic of a statute in light of a distinguishable precedent; it resolved nothing about the law of sovereign immunity.</p><p>Commendably, the Lundgrens acknowledged all this at oral argument.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.  Instead of seeking to defend the Washington Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <i>Yakima</i>, they now ask us to affirm their judgment on an entirely distinct alternative ground.  At common law, they say, sovereigns enjoyed no immunity from actions involving immovable property located in the territory of another sovereign.  As our cases have put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schooner Exchange</i> v. <i>McFaddon</i>, 7 Cranch 116, 145 (1812).  Relying on this line of reasoning, the Lundgrens argue, the Tribe cannot assert sovereign immunity because this suit relates to immovable property located in the State of Washington that the Tribe purchased in the \xe2\x80\x9cthe character of a private individual.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The Tribe and the federal government disagree.  They note that immunity doctrines lifted from other contexts do not always neatly apply to Indian tribes.  See <i>Kiowa Tribe of Okla.</i> v. <i>Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.</i>,523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 751, 756 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he immunity possessed by Indian tribes is not coextensive with that of the States\xe2\x80\x9d).  And since the founding, they say, the political branches rather than judges have held primary responsibility for determining when foreign sovereigns may be sued for their activities in this country.  <i>Verlinden B. V.</i> v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>,461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480, 486 (1983); <i>Ex parte Peru</i>,318 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578, 588 (1943).</p><p>We leave it to the Washington Supreme Court to address these arguments in the first instance.  Although we have discretion to affirm on any ground supported by the law and the record that will not expand the relief granted below, <i>Thigpen</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>,468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, 30 (1984), in this case we think restraint is the best use of discretion.  Determining the limits on the sovereign immunity held by Indian tribes is a grave question; the answer will affect all tribes, not just the one before us; and the alternative argument for affirmance did not emerge until late in this case.  In fact, it appeared only when the United States filed an <i>amicus</i> brief in this case\xe2\x80\x94after briefing on certiorari, after the Tribe filed its opening brief, and after the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s other <i>amici</i> had their say.  This Court has often declined to take a \xe2\x80\x9cfirst view\xe2\x80\x9d of questions that make their appearance in this posture, and we think that course the wise one today.  <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709, 718,  n. 7 (2005).</p><p>The dissent is displeased with our decision on this score, but a contradiction lies at the heart of its critique.  First, the dissent assures us that the immovable property exception applies with irresistible force\xe2\x80\x94nothing more than a matter of \xe2\x80\x9chornbook law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x9310 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  But then, the dissent claims that allowing the Washington Supreme Court to address that exception  is a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave\xe2\x80\x9d decision that \xe2\x80\x9ccasts uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d over the law and leaves lower courts with insufficient \xe2\x80\x9cguidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post,</i> at 3, 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Both cannot be true.  If the immovable property exception presents such an easy question, then it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see what terrible things could happen if we allow the Washington Supreme Court to answer it.  Surely our state court colleagues are no less versed than we in \xe2\x80\x9chornbook law,\xe2\x80\x9d and we are confident they can and will faithfully apply it.  And what if, instead, the question turns out to be more complicated than the dissent promises?  In that case the virtues of inviting full adversarial testing will have proved themselves once again.  Either way, we remain sanguine about the consequences.</p><p>The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s other objection to a remand rests on a belief that the immovable property exception was the source of \xe2\x80\x9cthe disagreement that led us to take this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 1.  But this too is mistaken.  As we\xe2\x80\x99ve explained, the courts below and the certiorari-stage briefs before us said precisely nothing on the subject.  Nor do we understand how the dissent might think otherwise\xe2\x80\x94for its essential premise is that<i> no</i> disagreement exists, or is even possible, about the exception\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The source of confusion in the lower courts that led to our review was the one about <i>Yakima</i>, see <i>supra</i>, at 1, n., and we have dispelled it.  That is work enough for the day.  We vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">*\xc2\xa0Compare 187 Wash. 2d 857, 865\xe2\x80\x93869,<i> </i>389 P. 3d 569, 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (2017) (case below); <i>Cass County Joint Water Resource Dist.</i> v. <i>1.43 Acres of Land in Highland Twp.</i>, 2002 ND 83, 643 N.

There should be a means of resolving a mundane dispute over property ownership, even when one of the parties to the dispute\xe2\x80\x94involving non-trust, non-reservation land\xe2\x80\x94is an Indian tribe.  The correct answer cannot be that the tribe always wins no matter what; otherwise a tribe could wield sovereign immunity as a sword and seize property with impunity, even without a colorable claim of right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tribe suggests that the proper mode of redress is for the Lundgrens\xe2\x80\x94who purchased their property long before the Tribe came into the picture\xe2\x80\x94to negotiate with the Tribe.  Although the parties got off on the wrong foot here, the Tribe insists that negotiations would run more smoothly if the Lundgrens \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood [its] immunity from suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 60.  In other words, once the Court makes clear that the Lundgrens ultimately have no recourse, the parties can begin working toward a sensible settlement.  That, in my mind at least, is not a meaningful remedy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Solicitor General proposes a different out-of-court solution.  Taking up this Court\xe2\x80\x99s passing comment that a disappointed litigant may continue to assert his title, see <i>Block</i> v. <i>North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 273, 291\xe2\x80\x93292 (1983), the Solicitor General more pointedly suggests that the Lundgrens should steer into the conflict: Go onto the disputed property and chop down some trees, build a shed, or otherwise attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cinduce [the Tribe] to file a quiet-title action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  Such brazen tactics may well have the desired effect of causing the Tribe to waive its sovereign immunity.  But I am skeptical that the law requires private individuals\xe2\x80\x94who, again, had no prior dealings with the Tribe\xe2\x80\x94to pick a fight in order to vindicate their interests. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today thus seem intolerable, unless there is another means of resolving property disputes of this sort.  Such a possibility was discussed in the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief, the Lundgrens\xe2\x80\x99 brief, and the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s reply brief, and extensively explored at oral argument\xe2\x80\x94the exception to sovereign immunity for actions to determine rights in immovable property.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cproperty ownership is not an inherently sovereign function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Permanent Mission of India to United Nations</i> v. <i>City of New York</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193, 199 (2007).  Since the 18th century, it has been a settled principle of international law that a foreign state holding real prop- erty outside its territory is treated just like a private indi- vidual.  <i>Schooner Exchange</i> v. <i>McFaddon</i>, 7 Cranch 116, 145 (1812).  The same rule applies as a limitation on the sovereign immunity of States claiming an interest in land located within other States.  See <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Chattanooga</i>,\n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472, 480\xe2\x80\x93482 (1924).  The only question, as the Solicitor General concedes, Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25, is whether different principles afford Indian tribes a broader immunity from actions involving off-reservation land.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I do not object to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination to forgo consideration of the immovable-property rule at this time.  But if it turns out that the rule does not extend to tribal assertions of rights in non-trust, non-reservation property, the applicability of sovereign immunity in such circumstances would, in my view, need to be addressed in a future case.  See <i>Michigan </i>v. <i>Bay Mills Indian Commu- nity</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa08 (2014) (slip op., at 16, n.\xc2\xa08)  (reserving the question whether sovereign immunity would apply if a \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe[ ] has no alternative way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the very least, I hope the Lundgrens would carefully examine the full range of legal options for resolving this title dispute with their neighbors, before crossing onto the disputed land and firing up their chainsaws.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3904214">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 17\xe2\x80\x93387</p><p>_________________</p><p>UPPER SKAGIT INDIAN TRIBE, PETITIONER <i>v. </i>SHARLINE LUNDGREN, et\xc2\xa0vir</p><p>on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of washington</p><p>[May 21, 2018]</p><p></p><p>Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting.</p><p>We granted certiorari to decide whether \xe2\x80\x9ca court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of <i>in\xc2\xa0rem</i> jurisdiction overcome[s] the jurisdictional bar of tribal sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i; 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).  State and federal courts are divided on that question, but the Court does not give them an answer.  Instead, it holds only that <i>County of Yakima</i> v. <i>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation</i>,502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 251 (1992), \xe2\x80\x9cresolved nothing about the law of [tribal] sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5.  Unfortunately, neither does the decision today\xe2\x80\x94except to say that courts cannot rely on <i>County of Yakima</i>.  As a result, the disagreement that led us to take this case will persist.</p><p>The Court easily could have resolved that disagreement by addressing respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative ground for affirmance.  Sharline and Ray Lundgren\xe2\x80\x94whose family has maintained the land in question for more than 70 years\xe2\x80\x94ask us to affirm based on the \xe2\x80\x9cimmovable property\xe2\x80\x9d exception to sovereign immunity.  That exception is settled, longstanding, and obviously applies to tribal immunity\xe2\x80\x94as it does to every other type of sovereign immunity that has ever been recognized.  Although the Lundgrens did not raise this argument below, we have the discretion to reach it.  I would have done so.  The immovable-property exception was extensively briefed and argued, and its application here is straightforward.  Addressing the exception now would have ensured that property owners like the Lundgrens can protect their rights and that States like Washington can protect their sovereignty.  Because the Court unnecessarily chooses to leave them in limbo, I respectfully dissent.</p><p>I</p><p>As the Court points out, the parties did not raise the immovable-property exception below or in their certiorari-stage briefs.

The Court agrees that the immovable-property exception is necessary to an intelligent resolution of the question presented, which is why it remands that issue to the Washington Supreme Court.  See <i>ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But our normal practice is to address the issue ourselves, unless there are \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons to decline to exercise our discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones </i>v. <i>United States</i>,527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 373, 397, n.\xc2\xa012 (1999) (plurality opinion).</p><p>There are no good reasons here.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only proffered reason is that the applicability of the immovable-property exception is a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave question\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwill affect all tribes, not just the one before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 6.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  The exception\xe2\x80\x99s applicability might be \xe2\x80\x9cgrave,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is also clear.

Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to forgo answering the question presented is no less \xe2\x80\x9cgrave.\xe2\x80\x9d  It forces the Lundgrens to squander additional years and resources litigating their right to litigate.

The Court should have discharged that obligation here.</p><p>II</p><p>I would have resolved this case based on the immovable-property exception to sovereign immunity.  That excep- tion is well established.  And it plainly extends to tribal immunity, as it does to every other form of sovereign immunity.</p><p>A</p><p>The immovable-property exception has been hornbook  </p><p>law almost as long as there have been hornbooks.  For centuries, there has been \xe2\x80\x9cuniform authority in support of the view that there is no immunity from jurisdiction with respect to actions relating to immovable property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lauterpacht, The Problem of Jurisdictional Immunities of Foreign States, 28 Brit. Y.\xc2\xa0B. Int\xe2\x80\x99l Law 220, 244 (1951).[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  This immovable-property exception predates both the founding and the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s treaty with the United States.  Cornelius van Bynkershoek, a renowned 18th-century jurist,[<a href="#F3">3</a>] stated that it was \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cproperty which a prince has purchased for himself in the dominions of another .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be treated just like the property of private individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  De Foro Legatorum Liber Singularis 22 (G. Laing transl. 2d ed. 1946).  His conclusion echoed   </p><p>the 16th-century legal scholar Oswald Hilliger.  See <i>ibid.  </i>About a decade after Bynkershoek, Emer de Vattel explained that, when \xe2\x80\x9csovereigns have fiefs and other possessions in the territory of another prince; in such cases they hold them after the manner of private individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 The Law of Nations \xc2\xa783, p.\xc2\xa0139 (C. Fenwick transl. 1916); see also E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations \xc2\xa7115, p. 493 (J.

Sometimes called <i>lex situs </i>or <i>lex loci rei sitae</i>, the principle provides that \xe2\x80\x9cland is governed by the law of the place where it is situated<i>.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  F. Wharton, Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7273, p.\xc2\xa0607 (G. Parmele ed., 3d ed. 1905).  It reflects the fact that a sovereign \xe2\x80\x9ccannot suffer its own laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be changed\xe2\x80\x9d by another sovereign.  H. Wheaton, Elements of International Law \xc2\xa781, p.\xc2\xa0114 (1866).  As then-Judge Scalia explained, it is \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] territorial sovereign has a primeval interest in resolving all disputes over use or right to use of real property within its own domain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Asociacion de Reclamantes</i> v. <i>United Mexican States</i>, 735 F.\xc2\xa02d 1517, 1521 (CADC 1984).  And because \xe2\x80\x9cland is so indissolubly connected with the territory of a State,\xe2\x80\x9d a State \xe2\x80\x9ccannot permit\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign sovereign to displace its jurisdiction by purchasing land and then claiming \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Competence of Courts in Regard to Foreign States, 26 Am. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. Supp. 451, 578 (1932) (Competence of Courts).

The medieval jurist Bartolus of Sassoferatto had recognized the principle 500 years earlier in his commentary on conflicts of law under the Justinian Code.  See Bartolus, Conflict of Laws 29 (J. Beale transl. 1914).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  Bartolus explained that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there is a question of any right growing out of a thing itself, the custom or statute of the place where the thing is should be observed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Later authorities writing on conflicts of law consistently agreed that <i>lex rei sitae</i> determined the governing law in real-property disputes.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  And this Court likewise held, nearly 200 years ago, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of  </p><p> sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very government\xe2\x80\x9d have \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusive right of regulating the descent, distribution, and grants of the domain within its own boundaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Green</i> v. <i>Biddle</i>, 8 Wheat. 1, 12 (1823) (Story, J.).</p><p>The acceptance of the immovable-property exception has not wavered over time.  In the 20th century, as nations increasingly owned foreign property, it remained \xe2\x80\x9cwell settled in International law that foreign state immunity need not be extended in cases dealing with rights to interests in real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weber, The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976: Its Origin, Meaning, and Effect, 3 Yale J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 1, 33 (1976).  Countries around the world continued to recognize the exception in their statutory and decisional law.  See Competence of Courts 572\xe2\x80\x93590 (noting support for the exception in statutes from Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, as well as decisions from the United States, Austria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Germany, and Romania).  \xe2\x80\x9cAll modern authors are, in fact, agreed that in all disputes <i>in rem</i> regarding immovable property, the judicial authorities of the State possess as full a jurisdiction over foreign States as they  do over foreign individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Hyde, 2 International  Law 848, n.\xc2\xa033 (2d ed. 1945) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>The Restatement of Foreign Relations Law reflects this unbroken consensus.  Every iteration of the Restatement has deemed a suit concerning the ownership of real property to be \xe2\x80\x9coutside the scope of the principle of [sovereign] immunity of a foreign state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (Proposed Official Draft) \xc2\xa771, Comment <i>c, </i>p.\xc2\xa0228 (1962); see also Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa768(b) (1965) (similar); Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7455(1)(c) (1987) (denying that immunity exists for \xe2\x80\x9cclaims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to immovable property in the state of the forum\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7456(2) (Tent.

Sovereign immunity, the First Restatement explains, does not bar \xe2\x80\x9can action to obtain possession of or establish an ownership interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa771(b), at 226.</p><p>Given the centuries of uniform agreement on the  immovable-property exception, it is no surprise that all three branches of the United States Government have recognized it.  Writing for a unanimous Court and drawing on Bynkershoek and De Vattel, Chief Justice Marshall noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe property of a foreign sovereign is not distinguishable by any legal exemption from the property of an ordinary individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schooner Exchange </i>v. <i>McFaddon</i>, 7 Cranch 116, 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (1812).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and assuming the character of a private individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 145.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  The Court echoed this reasoning over a century later, holding that state sovereign immunity does not extend to \xe2\x80\x9c[l]and acquired by one State in another State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Chattanooga</i>,264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472, 480 (1924).  In 1952, the State Department acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is agreement[,] supported by practice, that sovereign immunity should not be claimed or granted in actions with respect to real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tate Letter 984.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  Two decades later, Congress endorsed the immovable-property exception by including it in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.  See28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9cA foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in any case<i> </i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue\xe2\x80\x9d).  This statutory exception was \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to codify the <i>pre-existing</i> real property exception to sovereign immunity recognized by international practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Permanent Mission of India to United Nations </i>v. <i>City of New York</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193, 200 (2007) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>The Court does not question any of the foregoing authorities.  Nor did the parties provide any reason to do so.  The Government, when asked to identify its \xe2\x80\x9cbest authority for the proposition that the baseline rule of common law was total immunity, including <i>in rem</i> actions,\xe2\x80\x9d pointed to just two sources.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10, 26.  The first was Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (emphasis deleted).  Yet \xe2\x80\x9cproperty ownership is not an inherently sovereign function,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Permanent Mission</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 199, and Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s general statement does not suggest that immunity is automatically available or is not subject to longstanding exceptions.  The Government also cited <i>Schooner Exchange</i>.  But as explained above, that  </p><p>decision expressly acknowledges the immovable-property exception.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s unconvincing arguments cannot overcome more than six centuries of consensus on the validity of the immovable-property exception.</p><p>B</p><p>Because the immovable-property exception clearly applies to both state and foreign sovereign immunity, the only question is whether it also applies to tribal immunity.  It does.</p><p>Just last Term, this Court refused to \xe2\x80\x9cexten[d]\xe2\x80\x9d tribal immunity \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond what common-law sovereign immunity principles would recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis </i>v. <i>Clarke</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2017) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  Tribes are \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic dependent nations,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cherokee Nation </i>v. <i>Georgia</i>, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831), that \xe2\x80\x9cno longer posses[s] the full attributes of sovereignty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wheeler</i>,435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 313, 323 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the \xe2\x80\x9climited character\xe2\x80\x9d of their sovereignty, <i>ibid.</i>, Indian tribes possess only \xe2\x80\x9cthe common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Santa Clara Pueblo</i> v. <i>Martinez</i>,436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49, 58 (1978).  That is why this Court recently declined an invitation to make tribal immunity \xe2\x80\x9cbroader than the protection offered by state or federal sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lewis</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Accordingly, because States and foreign countries are subject to the immovable-property exception, Indian tribes are too.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason to depart from these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 7).</p><p>In declining to reach the immovable-property exception, the Court highlights two counterarguments that the Tribe and the United States have raised for why the exception should not extend to tribal immunity.  Neither argument has any merit.</p><p>First, the Court notes that \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity doctrines lifted from other contexts do not always neatly apply to Indian tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5 (citing <i>Kiowa Tribe of Okla. </i>v. <i>Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.</i>,523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 751, 756 (1998)).  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority for that proposition merely states that tribal immunity \xe2\x80\x9cis not coextensive with that of <i>the States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 756 (emphasis added).  Even assuming that is so, it does not mean that the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s immunity can be more expansive than any recognized form of sovereign immunity, including the immunity of the United States and foreign countries.  See <i>Lewis</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  And the Tribe admits that this Court has previously limited tribal immunity to conform with analogous \xe2\x80\x9climitations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in suits against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 22.  No one argues that the United States could claim sovereign immunity if it wrongfully asserted ownership of private property in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x94the equivalent of what the Tribe did here.  The United States plainly would be subject to suit in that country\xe2\x80\x99s courts.  See Competence of Courts 572\xe2\x80\x93590.</p><p>Second, the Court cites two decisions for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9csince the founding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the political branches rather than judges have held primary responsibility for determining when foreign sovereigns may be sued for their activities in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6 (citing <i>Verlinden B. V.</i> v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>,461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480, 486 (1983); <i>Ex parte Peru</i>,318 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578, 588 (1943)).  But those cases did not involve tribal immunity.  They were admiralty suits in which foreign sovereigns sought to recover ships they allegedly owned.  See <i>Verlinden</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 486 (citing cases involving ships allegedly owned by Italy, Peru, and Mexico);<i> Ex\xc2\xa0parte Peru</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 579 (mandamus action by Peru regarding its steamship).  Those decisions were an extension of the common-law principle, recognized in <i>Schooner Exchange</i>,<i> </i>that sovereign immunity applies to vessels owned by a foreign sovereign.  See <i>Berizzi Brothers Co. </i>v. <i>S.\xc2\xa0S. Pesaro</i>,271 U.\xc2\xa0S. 562, 571\xe2\x80\x93576 (1926).  These cases encourage deference to the political branches on sensitive questions of foreign affairs.  But they do not suggest that courts can ignore longstanding limits on sovereign immunity, such as the immovable-property exception.  And they do not suggest that courts can abdicate their judicial duty to decide the scope of tribal immunity\xe2\x80\x94a duty this Court exercised just last Term.

See, <i>e.g., Munday </i>v. <i>Wisconsin Trust Co.</i>,252 U.\xc2\xa0S. 499, 503 (1920) (\xe2\x80\x9clong ago declared\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> Arndt </i>v. <i>Griggs</i>,134 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316, 321 (1890) (\xe2\x80\x9cheld repeatedly\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Fox</i>,94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 315, 320 (1877) (\xe2\x80\x9cundoubted\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>McCormick </i>v. <i>Sullivant</i>, 10 Wheat. 192, 202 (1825) (\xe2\x80\x9can acknowledged principle of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Allowing the judge-made doctrine of tribal immunity to intrude on such a fundamental aspect of state sovereignty contradicts the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s design, which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>New York </i>v. <i>United States</i>,505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144, 188 (1992) (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 256).</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address the immovable-property exception in this case is difficult to justify.  It leaves our colleagues in the state and federal courts with little more guidance than they had before.  It needlessly delays relief for the Lundgrens, who must continue to litigate the threshold question whether they can litigate their indisputable right to their land.  And it does not address a clearly erroneous tribal-immunity claim: one that asserts a sweeping and absolute immunity that no other sovereign has ever enjoyed\xe2\x80\x94not a State, not a foreign nation, and not even the United States.</p><p>I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court does not question the adequacy of the briefing or identify factual questions that need further development.
