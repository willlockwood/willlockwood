CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This motion is denied 1, because it is an attempt to use the writ of mandamus as a writ of error to bring here for review the judgment of the Circuit Court upon a plea to the jurisdiction filed in the suit, and 2, because if a writ of mandamus could be used for such a purpose, the judgment below was clearly right.  Under sec. 739 of the Revised Statutes, no civil suit not local in its nature can be brought in the circuit court of the United States, against an inhabitant of the United States by original process in any other state than that of which he is an inhabitant or in which he is found at the time of serving the writ.  It is conceded that the person against whom this suit was brought in the circuit court was an inhabitant of the State of Massachusetts, and was not found in or served with process in Iowa.  Clearly, then, he was not suable in the Circuit Court of the District of Iowa, and unless he could be sued, no attachment could issue from that court against his property.  An attachment is but an incident to a suit, and unless the suit can be maintained, the attachment must fall.  The Act of June 4, 1880, c. 120, "providing the times and places of holding the Circuit Court of the United States in the District of Iowa and for other purposes," 21 Stat. 155, divides that district into four divisions and requires suits against an inhabitant of the district to be brought in the division in which he resides.  The provision of the second section that "where the defendant is not a resident of the district, suit may be brought in any division where property or the defendant is found" applies only to suits which may be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="797">Page 103 U. S. 797</a></p><p> properly brought in the district against a nonresident.  Such a suit, if not local, must be in the division where the defendant is found when served with process; if local, in the division where the property which is the subject matter or the action is situated.  There is not manifested anywhere in this act an intention of repealing sec. 739, so far as it affects the Iowa district.</p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
