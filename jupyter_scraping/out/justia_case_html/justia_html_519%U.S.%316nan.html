An exception to this requirement permits a contractor to pay a lower wage to workers participating in an approved apprenticeship program. This case presents the question whether the pre-emption provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1001 <i>et seq., </i>supersedes California\'s prevailing wage law to the extent that the law prohibits payment of an apprentice wage to an apprentice trained in an unapproved program. We conclude that California\'s law does not "relate to" employee benefit plans, and thus is not pre-empted.</p><p align="center">\nI A</p><p>Since 1931, the Davis-Bacon Act, 46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 276a to 276a-5, has required that the wages paid on federal public works projects equal wages paid in the project\'s locale on similar, private construction jobs. California, in 1937, adopted a similar statute, which requires contractors who are awarded public works projects to pay their workers "not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed." Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1771 (West 1989). Under both the Davis-Bacon Act and California\'s prevailing wage law, public works contractors may pay less than the prevailing journeyman wage to apprentices in apprenticeship programs that meet standards promulgated under the National Apprenticeship Act, 50 Stat.</p><p><i>Melvin Radowitz, </i>and <i>Daniel Feinberg; </i>for the Associated General Contractors of America, San Diego Chapter, Inc., et al. by <i>John </i>G. <i>Roberts, Jr., Michael E.

C. \xc2\xa7 50 (known popularly as the Fitzgerald Act).l See 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 29.5(b)(5) (1996); Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1777.5 (West 1989 and Supp. 1997). In most circumstances, California public works contractors are not obliged to employ apprentices, but if they do, the apprentice wage is only permitted for those apprentices in approved programs.</p><p>The federal arbiter of apprenticeship program adequacy is the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT), located within the Department of Labor. An apprenticeship program that seeks to provide federal public works contractors with apprentice-wage-eligible apprentices must receive the blessing of either the BAT or a "State Apprenticeship Agency." 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 29.3 (1996). Since 1978, California\'s state apprenticeship agency, the California Apprenticeship Council (CAC), has been authorized under 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 29.12 to approve apprenticeship programs for federal purposes. App. 37. California has also charged the CAC with approving apprenticeship programs for purposes of California\'s prevailing wage statute. See Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3071 (West 1989). Pursuant to the Fitzgerald Act, the United States Secretary of Labor has promulgated apprenticeship program standards. 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 29.5 (1996). California has adopted its own apprenticeship standards, 8 Cal. Code Regs. \xc2\xa7 212 (1996), that are "substantively similar" to the federal standards. <i>Southern Cal.

Two months later, Sound Systems Media entered a new collective-bargaining agreement with a different union.

That approval was not retroactive.</p><p>In March 1989, yet another union filed a complaint against Sound Systems Media with petitioner Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the California Department of Industrial Relations. Petitioner issued a notice of noncompliance to both Dillingham Construction and Sound Systems Media, charging that Sound Systems Media had violated Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1771 (West 1989) by paying the apprentice wage, rather than the prevailing journeyman wage, to apprentices from a nonapproved program. The County of Sonoma was ordered to withhold certain moneys from Dillingham Construction for the violation.</p><p>Respondents filed suit to prevent petitioners from interfering with payment under the subcontract. Their complaint alleged, <i>inter alia, </i>that ERISA pre-empted enforcement of the prevailing wage law. Respondents argued that the Electronic and Communications Systems JATC was an "employee welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of ERISA \xc2\xa7 3(1), 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1002(1),2 and that California\'s prevailing wage statute "relate[d] to" it, and was therefore superseded by ERISA\'s pre-emption provision, \xc2\xa7 514(a), 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a).3 The District Court agreed that the prevailing wage statute "relate[d] to" ERISA plans, but con-</p><p>2 Section 3(1) defines an "employee welfare benefit plan" as: "[A]ny plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants ... (A) medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, <i>apprenticeship or other training programs, </i>or day care centers, scholarship funds or prepaid legal services ....

Because California\'s prevailing wage statute was not an "enforcement mechanism" of the Fitzgerald Act, however, the Ninth Circuit parted company with the District Court and held that \xc2\xa7 1777.5 was not preserved by ERISA\'s saving clause. <i>Id., </i>at 721.

The CAC has, however, promulgated regulations making clear that the class of apprenticeship program sponsors who may provide approved apprentices is broader. See 8 Cal.

Lab. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3075 (West 1989) (stating that an "apprenticeship program sponsor may be a joint apprenticeship committee, unilateral management or labor apprenticeship committee, or an individual employer"). An apprenticeship program, it would seem, can be maintained by a single employer, and its costs can be defrayed out of that employer\'s general assets.</p><p>To comport with \xc2\xa7 302(c)(6) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 157, as amended, 29 U.

The existence of that fund triggers ERISA coverage over programs like that of the Electronic and Communications Systems JATC. See ERISA Advisory Op. No. 94-14A (Apr. 20, 1994). But an employee benefit program <i>not </i>funded through a separate fund is not an ERISA plan. In <i>Massachusetts </i>v. <i>Morash, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/107/case.html">490 U. S. 107</a> (1989), we recognized a distinction between vacation benefits paid out of an accumulated fund and those paid out of an employer\'s general assets. A fund established to pay vacation benefits, we held, constituted an employee welfare benefit plan; the policy at issue in <i>Morash, </i>whereby vacation benefits were paid out of general assets, did not. The distinction, we concluded, was compelled by ERISA\'s object and policy:</p><blockquote><p>\n"In enacting ERISA, Congress\' primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employ-</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="327">327</a></p><blockquote><p>\nees benefits from accumulated funds.

See, <i>e. </i>g., 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 2510.3-1(k) (1994) (scholarship programs paid for out of an employer\'s general assets are not ERISA plans); \xc2\xa7 2510.3-1(b)(3)(iv) (training provided on the job with general assets does not constitute ERISA plan); see also ERISA Advisory Op.

No. 83-32A (June 21, 1983) (in-house professional development program financed out of general assets is not an ERISA plan). Although none of these regulations specifically answers the question whether an unfunded apprenticeship program is covered by ERISA, they suggest-as does our decision in <i>Morash-that </i>it is not.5</p><p>5We are told that "[m]ost state-approved apprenticeship programs in the construction industry in California appear to be ERISA plans." Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>17, n. 8. Between April and June 1994, California had 175 joint apprenticeship programs and 13 "unilateral" ones. <i>Ibid. </i>As noted above, the costs of the joint apprenticeship programs are necessarily defrayed out of separate funds. The Government points out that some of the 13 unilateral programs may also have separate funds. <i>Ibid. </i>No party before us has established that <i>all </i>programs do. Cf. <i>The Travelers Ins.

S., at 139. An apprenticeship program meeting the substantive standards set forth in the Fitzgerald Act regulations can be approved whether or not its funding apparatus is of a kind as to bring it under ERISA. See <i>Southern Cal. ABC, </i>4 Cal. 4th, at 429, n. 1, 841 P. 2d, at 1014, n. 1. Section 1777.5 is indifferent to the funding, and attendant ERISA coverage, of apprenticeship programs. Accordingly, California\'s prevailing wage statute does not make reference to ERISA plans. We turn now to the question whether it nonetheless has a "connection with" such plans.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>In <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </i>we held that the New York Human Rights Law, which prohibited "employers from structuring their employee benefit plans in a manner that discriminates on the basis of pregnancy," and New York\'s Disability Benefits Law, which required "employers to pay employees specific benefits," "relate[d] to" ERISA plans. 463 U. S., at 97. <i>Shaw </i>and other of our ERISA pre-emption decisions, see, <i>e. g., FMC Corp. </i>v. <i>Holliday, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/52/case.html">498 U.

S. 504</a> (1981), presented us with state statutes that "mandated employee benefit structures or their administration"; in those cases, we concluded that these requirements amounted to "connection[s] with" ERISA plans. See <i>Travelers, </i>514 U. S., at 658.</p><p>The state law at issue in <i>Travelers, </i>our most recent exercise in ERISA pre-emption, stands in considerable contrast. That statute regulated hospital rates, and required hospitals to exact surcharges (ranging from 9% to 24% of the rate set under the statute) from patients whose hospital bills were paid by any of a variety of non-Blue Cross/Blue Shield providers. Because ERISA plans, as might be expected, were predominant among the purchasers of insurance, see Brief</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="329">329</a></p><p>for Petitioner in <i>Travelers, </i>O. T. 1994, No. 93-1408, p. 1-2, the statute was asserted to run afoul of ERISA\'s preemption provision. The differential rates charged to commercially insured patients and to patients insured by Blue Cross/Blue Shield (collectively "the Blues") made commercial insurance relatively more expensive-and relatively less attractive. The resulting cost variations encouraged insurance purchasers, including ERISA plans, to provide insurance benefits through the Blues. Commercial insurers argued that these cost variations and their resulting economic effects had a "connection with" those ERISA plans, requiring pre-emption of the law that dictated them.</p><p>We upheld the statute. The "indirect economic influence" of the surcharge, we noted, did not "bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself." 514 U. S., at 659. Nor did the indirect influence of the surcharge "preclude uniform administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package if a plan wishe[d] to provide one." <i>Id., </i>at 660. Indeed, if ERISA were concerned with any state action-such as medical-care quality standards or hospital workplace regulations-that increased costs of providing certain benefits, and thereby potentially affected the choices made by ERISA plans, we could scarcely see the end of ERISA\'s pre-emptive reach, and the words "relate to" would limit nothing. <i>Id., </i>at 660-661. We also noted that several States regulated hospital charges at the time that ERISA was enacted, and yet neither ERISA\'s language nor legislative history made any mention of pre-empting these state efforts.6</p><p>6 In fact, the very same Congress that enacted ERISA adopted, a short time later, the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA), Pub. L. 93-641,88 Stat. 2225, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1-3, repealed by Pub. L. 99-660, title VII, \xc2\xa7 701(a), 100 Stat. 3799, which "sought to encourage and help fund state responses to growing health care costs and the widely diverging availability of health services." <i>Travelers, supra, </i>at 665. The NHPRDA had in mind a system akin to New York\'s, and we thought it</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="330">330</a></p><p>330 CALIFORNIA DIV. OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT <i>v. </i>DILLINGHAM CONSTR., N. A., INC.</p><p>We think that, in every relevant respect, California\'s prevailing wage statute is indistinguishable from New York\'s surcharge program. At the outset, we note that apprenticeship standards and the wages paid on state public works have long been regulated by the States. As discussed in Part I-A, <i>supra, </i>California has required that prevailing wages be paid on its public works projects for nearly as long as Congress has required them to be paid on federal projects, and for more than 40 years prior to the enactment of ERISA. Similarly, California has legislated in the apprenticeship area for the better part of this century. See, <i>e. </i>g., The ShelleyMaloney Apprentice Labor Standards Act, 1939 Cal. Stat. 220, codified at Cal. Lab. Code \xc2\xa7 3070 <i>et seq. </i>Congress, in the Fitzgerald Act, recognized pre-existing state efforts in regulating apprenticeship programs and apparently expected that those efforts would continue. See 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 50 (directing the Secretary of Labor "to cooperate with State agencies engaged in the formulation and promotion of standards of apprenticeship"); see also H. R. Rep. No. 945, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).</p><p>That the States traditionally regulated these areas would not alone immunize their efforts; ERISA certainly contemplated the pre-emption of substantial areas of traditional state regulation. The wages to be paid on public works projects and the substantive standards to be applied to apprenticeship training programs are, however, quite remote from the areas with which ERISA is expressly concerned" \'reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and the like.\'" <i>Travelers, supra, </i>at 661 (quoting <i>Shaw, </i>463 U. S., at 98). A reading of \xc2\xa7 514(a) resulting in the pre-emption of traditionally state-regulated substantive law in those areas where ERISA has nothing to say would be "unsettling," <i>Travelers,</i></p><p>unlikely that the Congress that enacted ERISA would later have sought to encourage a state program that ERISA would pre-empt.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="331">331</a></p><p>514 U. S., at 665.7 Given the paucity of indication in ERISA and its legislative history of any intent on the part of Congress to pre-empt state apprenticeship training standards, or state prevailing wage laws that incorporate them, we are reluctant to alter our ordinary "assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act." <i>Rice, </i>331 U. S., at 230.8 Accordingly, as in</p><p>7 In <i>Travelers, </i>we were convinced that Congress did not intend preemption of New York\'s law both by the lack of any positive indication that Congress harbored such an intent, and by indirect evidence-the NHPRDA-that the Congress that enacted ERISA did not intend to supersede state laws like New York\'s regulation of hospital charges. 514 U. S., at 664-668. We face here a similar absence of positive indications on the part of Congress that apprenticeship or prevailing wage statutes would be superseded. The United States further argues that the Fitzgerald Act is analogous to the NHPRDA: Were we to hold \xc2\xa7 1777.5 preempted "[t]hat result \'would leave States without the authority to do just what Congress was expressly trying to induce them to do by enacting the Fitzgerald Act.\'" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>22 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). In <i>Travelers, </i>we thought it implausible that the Congress that enacted ERISA intended to pre-empt state laws that the same Congress subsequently sought to encourage with the NHPRDA. It is not, however, inconceivable for the ERISA Congress to intend the pre-emption of state statutes resulting from the pre-existing Fitzgerald Act. So, the United States\' analogy is not decisive. It does, however, aid our conclusion that Congress\' silence on the pre-emption of state statutes that Congress previously sought to foster counsels against pre-emption here.</p><p>S Respondents and two of their <i>amici </i>point to bills introduced in Congress for the purpose, at least in part, of overruling lower court decisions holding prevailing wage statutes like California\'s pre-empted. See Brief for Respondent 23, Brief for Signatory Members of the Coalition to Preserve ERISA Pre-emption as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>11, and Brief for Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>26-27 (all citing H. R. 1036, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. 1580, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993)). It is argued that Congress\' unwillingness to amend \xc2\xa7 514(a) in response to these decisions is evidence that Congress believed that those opinions accurately interpreted ERISA\'s pre-emptive scope. We have rejected similar arguments before. See <i>Firestone Tire </i>&amp; <i>Rubber Co. </i>v.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="332">332</a></p><p>332 CALIFORNIA DIV. OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT <i>v. </i>DILLINGHAM CONSTR., N. A., INC.</p><p><i>Travelers, </i>we address the substance of the California statute with the presumption that ERISA did not intend to supplant it.</p><p>Like New York\'s surcharge requirement, the apprenticeship portion of the prevailing wage statute does not bind ERISA plans to anything. No apprenticeship program is required by California law to meet California\'s standards. See <i>Southern Cal. ABC, </i>4 Cal. 4th, at 428, 841 P. 2d, at 1013. If a contractor chooses to hire apprentices for a public works project, it need not hire them from an approved program (although if it does not, it must pay these apprentices journeyman wages). So, apprenticeship programs that have not gained CAC approval may still supply public works contractors with apprentices. Unapproved apprenticeship programs also may supply apprentices to private contractors.9 The effect of \xc2\xa7 1777.5 on ERISA apprenticeship programs, therefore, is merely to provide some measure of economic incentive to comport with the State\'s requirements, at least to the extent that those programs seek to provide apprentices who can work on public works projects at a lower wage.</p><p>Apprenticeship programs have confronted these differential economic incentives since well before the enactment of ERISA, and would face them today even if California had no prevailing wage statute. To supply apprentices eligible for the apprenticeship wage to <i>federal </i>public works contractors, an apprenticeship program must meet the standards promulgated by California under the Fitzgerald Act.10 What is</p><p><i>Bruch, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/case.html">489 U.

Brief for State of Washington et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>21, n. 14 (citing F. W. Dodge Division, McGraw-Hill Information Systems, Inc. (1996)).</p><p>10 It may also be that, because California\'s standards are "substantively similar," <i>Southern California ABC, </i>4 Cal. 4th, at 434,841 P. 2d, at 1017, to the federal standards, multistate apprenticeship programs are not</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="333">333</a></p><p>more, with or without the possibility of being able to provide apprentices eligible for a lower wage on public projects, apprenticeship programs in California have other incentives to seek CAC approval. See <i>Southern Cal. ABC, supra, </i>at 429, 841 P. 2d, at 1013 ("In California, additional financial incentives exist in the form of direct financial subsidies for training provided by approved programs," and because "an apprentice who completes an approved training program obtains a certificate of completion naming him or her a skilled journeyman in the chosen trade"). It cannot be gainsaid that \xc2\xa7 1777.5 has the effect of encouraging apprenticeship programs-including ERISA plans-to meet the standards set out by California, but it has not been demonstrated here that the added inducement created by the wage break available on state public works projects is tantamount to a compulsion upon apprenticeship programs.ll</p><p>saddled with "the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government." <i>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </i>v. <i>McClendon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/133/case.html">498 U. S. 133</a>, 142 (1990). Then again, the area of apprenticeship training may be one where uniformity of substantive standards across States is impossible. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>20 ("[P]revailing wages in different States-or even in different areas of a single State-may vary substantially, and training requirements for membership in skilled trades may also vary among different trades, different communities, and different States"). We need not resolve this question. Suffice it to say that the federal and state apprenticeship standards are not mandatory, and California\'s standards do not result in disuniformities different in kind from those that would exist without them.</p><p>11 It is not conclusive as to California\'s apprenticeship programs, but we note that some data support the conclusion that the prevailing wage break for approved apprenticeship programs does not present ERISA plans with a Hobson\'s choice. <i>Amici </i>State of Washington et al. inform us that "[w]hile the federal government and twenty-seven of the thirty-one states which have prevailing wage laws have [a wage break], it is estimated that only fifty percent of apprentices in this country are in state or federally \'approved\' programs."

OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT <i>v. </i>DILLINGHAM CONSTR., N. A., INC.</p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., concurring</p><p>degree of pre-emption that no sensible person could have intended-which it is not.</p><p>I think it would greatly assist our function of clarifying the law if we simply acknowledged that our first take on this statute was wrong; that the "relate to" clause of the pre-emption provision is meant, not to set forth a <i>test </i>for pre-emption, but rather to identify the field in which ordinary <i>field pre-emption </i>applies-namely, the field of laws regulating "employee benefit planes] described in section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003(b) of this title," 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a). Our new approach to ERISA pre-emption is set forth in <i>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/86/case.html">510 U. S. 86</a>, 99 (1993): "[WJe discern no solid basis for believing that Congress, when it designed ERISA, intended fundamentally to alter traditional pre-emption analysis." I think it accurately describes our current ERISA jurisprudence to say that we apply ordinary field pre-emption, and, of course, ordinary conflict preemption. See generally <i>Silkwood </i>v. <i>Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 </i>U. S. 238, 248 (1984) (explaining general principles of field and conflict pre-emption); <i>Rice </i>v. <i>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (1947) (field pre-emption); <i>Florida Lime </i>&amp; <i>Avocado Growers, Inc. </i>v. <i>Paul, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a>, 142-143 (1963) (conflict pre-emption). Nothing more mysterious than that; and except as establishing that, "relates to" is irrelevant.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
