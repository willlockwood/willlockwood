Respondent offered to plead guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and grand theft, but pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and aggravated robbery.  Over the State\'s objection, the trial court accepted the "guilty" pleas to the lesser offenses, and then granted respondent\'s motion to dismiss the two most serious charges on the ground that, because of his guilty pleas, further prosecution on the more serious offenses was barred by the double jeopardy prohibitions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  This judgment was affirmed on appeal through the Ohio state courts, and we granted certiorari. 465 U.S. 1004 (1984).  We now reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio and hold that prosecuting respondent on the two more serious charges would not constitute the type of "multiple prosecution" prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 467 U. S. 495</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thomas Hill was shot to death in his apartment in the city of Mentor-on-the-Lake, a city northeast of Cleveland on Lake Erie.  Several weeks later, a county grand jury indicted respondent on one count each of murder, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] involuntary manslaughter, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] aggravated robbery, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and grand theft. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Meanwhile, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 467 U. S. 496</a></p><p> respondent had left Ohio and was not arraigned on the charges until nearly two years after the killing.  At his arraignment, respondent offered to plead guilty only to the charges of involuntary manslaughter and grand theft, while pleading not guilty to the more serious offenses of murder and aggravated robbery.  Over the State\'s objection, the trial court accepted the guilty pleas and sentenced respondent to a term of imprisonment.  App.19-21.  Respondent then moved to dismiss the remaining charges against him on the ground that their further prosecution would violate his right under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense.  The trial court granted respondent\'s motion and dismissed the remaining charges, finding that, because involuntary manslaughter and grand theft were, respectively, lesser included offenses of the remaining charges of murder and aggravated robbery, continued prosecution of the greater offenses after acceptance of respondent\'s guilty pleas on the lesser offenses was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A24.</p>\n<p>The Ohio Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the decision of the trial court.  6 Ohio St.3d 420, 453 N.E.2d 595 (1983).  The State Supreme Court held that, in these circumstances, aggravated robbery was an "allied offens[e] of similar import" to theft, <em>id.</em> at 422, 453 N.E.2d at 598, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and reasoned that, since state law permitted conviction on only one of these charges, acceptance of respondent\'s guilty plea to the charge of theft prevented conviction for the charge of aggravated robbery.  The crime of involuntary manslaughter was held to be distinguishable from the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 467 U. S. 497</a></p><p> offense of murder only by the mental states required to commit each offense, but that, in any one killing, an offender could only be convicted of involuntary manslaughter or murder, but not both crimes. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>We think the Supreme Court of Ohio was mistaken in its observation that "this case concerns the third double jeopardy protection prohibiting multiple punishments for the same offense."  <em>Id.</em> at 421, 453 N.E.2d at 598. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Double </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 467 U. S. 498</a></p><p> Jeopardy Clause, of course, affords a defendant three basic protections:</p>\n<p>"\'[It] protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.  It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.  And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Brown v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/161/case.html">432 U. S. 161</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/161/case.html#165">432 U.

As we have explained on numerous occasions, the bar to retrial following acquittal or conviction ensures that the State does not make repeated attempts to convict an individual, thereby exposing him to continued embarrassment, anxiety, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 467 U. S. 499</a></p><p> and expense, while increasing the risk of an erroneous conviction or an impermissibly enhanced sentence.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/case.html">420 U. S. 332</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/case.html#343">420 U. S. 343</a></span> (1975); <em>Green v.

S. 187</a></span>-188 (1957).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the double jeopardy protection against multiple trials, the final component of double jeopardy -- protection against cumulative punishments -- is designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature.  Because the substantive power to prescribe crimes and determine punishments is vested with the legislature, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/18/76/case.html">United States v. Wiltberger,</a></span></em> 5 Wheat. 76,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/18/76/case.html#93">18 U. S. 93</a></span> (1820), the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are "multiple" is essentially one of legislative intent, <em>see Missouri v. Hunter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/359/case.html">459 U. S. 359</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/359/case.html#366">459 U. S. 366</a></span>-368 (1983). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But where a defendant is retried following conviction, the Clause\'s third protection ensures that, after a subsequent conviction, a defendant receives credit for time already served.  <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/711/case.html#718">395 U. S. 718</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We accept, as we must, the Ohio Supreme Court\'s determination that the Ohio Legislature did not intend cumulative punishment for the two pairs of crimes involved here.  But before respondent can ever be punished for the offenses of murder and aggravated robbery, he will first have to be found guilty of those offenses.  The trial court\'s dismissal of these more serious charges did more than simply prevent the imposition of cumulative punishments; it halted completely the proceedings that ultimately would have led to a verdict of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 467 U. S. 500</a></p><p> guilt or innocence on these more serious charges.  Presumably the trial court, in the event of a guilty verdict on the more serious offenses, will have to confront the question of cumulative punishments as a matter of state law, but because of that court\'s ruling preventing even the trial of the more serious offenses, that stage of the prosecution was never reached.  While the Double Jeopardy Clause may protect a defendant against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same offense, the Clause does not prohibit the State from prosecuting respondent for such multiple offenses in a single prosecution.</p>\n<p>Respondent urges, as an alternative basis for affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio, that further prosecution of the counts which were dismissed would violate the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple prosecutions.  Brief for Respondent 17-18.  He concedes that, on the authority of our decision in <em>Brown v. Ohio, supra,</em> the State is not prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause from charging respondent with greater and lesser included offenses and prosecuting those offenses in a single trial.  Brief for Respondent 7.  But, he argues, his conviction and sentence on the charges of involuntary manslaughter and grand theft mean that further prosecution on the remaining offenses will implicate the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution following conviction.  The court below never had occasion to address this argument. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The answer to this contention seems obvious to us.  Respondent was indicted on four related charges growing out of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 467 U. S. 501</a></p><p> a murder and robbery.  The grand jury returned a single indictment, and all four charges were embraced within a single prosecution.  Respondent\'s argument is apparently based on the assumption that trial proceedings, like amoebae, are capable of being infinitely subdivided, so that a determination of guilt and punishment on one count of a multicount indictment immediately raises a double jeopardy bar to continued prosecution on any remaining counts that are greater or lesser included offenses of the charge just concluded.  We have never held that, and decline to hold it now.</p>\n<p>Previously we have recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits prosecution of a defendant for a greater offense when he has already been tried and acquitted or convicted on the lesser included offense.  <em>See Brown v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/161/case.html">432 U. S. 161</a></span> (1977).  In <em>Brown,</em> the State first charged the defendant with "joyriding," that is, operating an auto without the owner\'s consent.  The defendant pleaded guilty to this charge, and was sentenced.  Subsequently, the State indicted the defendant for auto theft and joyriding, charges which this Court held were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, since the defendant had previously been convicted in a separate proceeding of joyriding, which was a lesser included offense of auto theft.  <em>Brown v. Ohio, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/161/case.html#169">432 U. S. 169</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We do not believe, however, that the principles of finality and prevention of prosecutorial overreaching applied in <em>Brown</em> reach this case.  No interest of respondent protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by continuing prosecution on the remaining charges brought in the indictment.  Here, respondent offered only to resolve part of the charges against him, while the State objected to disposing of any of the counts against respondent without a trial.  Respondent has not been exposed to conviction on the charges to which he pleaded not guilty, nor has the State had the opportunity to marshal its evidence and resources more than once or to hone its presentation of its case through a trial.  The acceptance of a guilty plea to lesser included offenses while charges on the greater offenses remain pending, moreover, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 467 U. S. 502</a></p><p> has none of the implications of an "implied acquittal" which results from a verdict convicting a defendant on lesser included offenses rendered by a jury charged to consider both greater and lesser included offenses.  <em>Cf. Price v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/323/case.html">398 U. S. 323</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/323/case.html#329">398 U. S. 329</a></span> (1970); <em>Green v. United States,</em> 355 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/184/case.html#191">355 U. S. 191</a></span>.  There simply has been none of the governmental overreaching that double jeopardy is supposed to prevent.  On the other hand, ending prosecution now would deny the State its right to one full and fair opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.  <em>Arizona v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html">434 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#509">434 U. S. 509</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>We think this is an even clearer case than <em>Jeffers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html">432 U. S. 137</a></span> (1977), where we rejected a defendant\'s claim of double jeopardy based upon a guilty verdict in the first of two successive prosecutions, when the defendant had been responsible for insisting that there be separate, rather than consolidated, trials.  Here, respondent\'s efforts were directed to separate disposition of counts in the same indictment where no more than one trial of the offenses charged was ever contemplated.  Notwithstanding the trial court\'s acceptance of respondent\'s guilty pleas, respondent should not be entitled to use the Double Jeopardy Clause as a sword to prevent the State from completing its prosecution on the remaining charges.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons we hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the State from continuing its prosecution of respondent on the charges of murder and aggravated robbery.

In the very next sentence, however, the opinion states that the two offenses are the same under the <em>Blockburger</em> test, <em>i.e.,</em> involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of the crime of murder.  This interpretation accords with the statement in the opinion that the principles of collateral estoppel applied in <em>Ashe v.

Donahey v. Edmondson,</em> 89 Ohio St. 93, 105 N.E. 269 (1913); <em>see also Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/437/case.html">342 U.

But Ohio courts do not suggest that the opinion is not germane to interpreting the court\'s holding as expressed in its syllabus.  <em>Hart v. Andrews,</em> 103 Ohio St. 218, 221, 132 N.E. 846, 847 (1921).  Indeed, where the grounds of the decision are not clearly predicated on state law, we have felt compelled to examine the opinion below to determine whether the Ohio Supreme Court may have ruled differently if it "had felt free, under our decisions, to do so."  <em>Perkins, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/437/case.html#443">342 U. S. 443</a></span>.</p>\n<p>A review of the court\'s syllabus indicates that the court did not articulate an independent state law ground for the decision.  The first part of the syllabus refers to state law in determining that, as allied offenses, the State may only obtain convictions on either aggravated robbery or grand theft, but not both.  But the syllabus does not explain why the State may not continue to press forward with its prosecution of respondent for aggravated robbery, since the multicount statute that bars multiple convictions for allied offenses plainly admits to the possibility that the State may prosecute allied offenses in a single prosecution.  <em>See</em> Ohio Rev.Code.Ann. \xc2\xa7 2941.25 (1982 and Supp.1983).  A look at the opinion accompanying the syllabus, however, shows that the judge writing the opinion believed that continued prosecution of respondent on the remaining charges was proscribed by the double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments.  6 Ohio St.3d at 421, 453 N.E.2d at 597.  The federal ground for the court\'s decision affirming the dismissal of the murder charge is much easier to discern, since the text of the court\'s syllabus refers directly to the prohibition against double jeopardy.  Although the court\'s reference to double jeopardy might arguably be to the Ohio version, <em>see</em> Ohio Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, the failure to indicate clearly that state double jeopardy protection was being invoked, when coupled with the references in the opinion to our decisions in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/711/case.html">395 U. S. 711</a></span> (1969), and <em>Ashe v. Swenson, supra,</em> convinces us that the Ohio Supreme Court based its decision on its interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>In the federal courts, the test established in <em>Blockburger v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/299/case.html">284 U. S. 299</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/299/case.html#304">284 U. S. 304</a></span> (1932), ordinarily determines whether the crimes are indeed separate, and whether cumulative punishments may be imposed.  <em>See Albernaz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html">450 U. S. 333</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html#337">450 U. S. 337</a></span> (1981); <em>Whalen v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/684/case.html">445 U.

Hunter,</em> however, the <em>Blockburger</em> test does not necessarily control the inquiry into the intent of a state legislature.  Even if the crimes are the same under <em>Blockburger,</em> if it is evident that a state legislature intended to authorize cumulative punishments, a court\'s inquiry is at an end.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent also argues that prosecution on the remaining charges is barred by the principles of collateral estoppel enunciated by this Court in <em>Ashe v. Swenson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/436/case.html">397 U. S. 436</a></span> (1970).  Even if the two were mutually exclusive crimes, <em>see</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra,</em> the taking of a guilty plea is not the same as an adjudication on the merits after full trial, such as took place in <em>Ashe v. Swenson.</em>  Moreover, in a case such as this, where the State has made no effort to prosecute the charges <em>seriatim,</em> the considerations of double jeopardy protection implicit in the application of collateral estoppel are inapplicable.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>We see no need to address the manner in which the trial court should resolve the question of the existing guilty pleas if the case proceeds to trial, the issue appearing to involve construction of state law and the jurisdiction of Ohio courts to fashion appropriate relief.  <em>See</em> Ohio Rule Crim.Proc. 32.1 (1982); <em>cf. Price v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/323/case.html">398 U. S. 323</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/323/case.html#332">398 U.

I agree with the Court, however, that continued prosecution of respondent on the charge of murder after respondent pleaded guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A conviction based on a plea of guilty has the same legal effect as a conviction based on a jury\'s verdict.  The conviction in this case authorized the State of Ohio to place respondent in prison for several years.  As the Court expressly recognizes,</p>\n<p>"the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits prosecution of a defendant for a greater offense when he has already been . . . convicted on the lesser included offense."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/493/case.html#501">467 U. S. 501</a></span>.  That statement fits this case precisely.  Since it is a correct statement of the law, I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio insofar as it denied the State the right to prosecute respondent on the charge of murder. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/493/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>* As far as the charge of aggravated robbery is concerned, it is perfectly obvious that the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court rests on the adequate and independent state ground that it was an "allied offense of similar import" to theft within the meaning of the Ohio rule that precludes prosecution for two such offenses.  The Court\'s cavalier disregard for the state law basis for this aspect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is totally unprecedented.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
