(Sprint), a national telecommunications service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.  Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls, which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint.  Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint.  Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.  Rejecting Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this question was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  As relief, Sprint sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Sprint also sought review of the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order in Iowa state court, reiterating the preemption argument made in Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s federal-court complaint and asserting several other claims.  Invoking Younger v. Harris, \n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37\n, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s abstention decision, concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongoing state-court review concerned Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s important interest in regulating and enforcing state utility rates.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0This case does not fall within any of the three classes of exceptional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate.

Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635\n, and thus had a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unflagging obligation\xe2\x80\x9d to hear and decide the case, Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n.  In Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.  This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592\n, or that implicate a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, but has reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9conly exceptional circumstances justify a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to decide a case in deference to the States,\xe2\x80\x9d New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, \n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350\n (NOPSI).  NOPSI identified three such \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, Younger precludes federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.  See 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368.  Second, certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil enforcement proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d warrant Younger abstention.  Ibid.  Finally, federal courts should refrain from interfering with pending \xe2\x80\x9ccivil proceedings involving certain orders .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to perform their judicial functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This Court has not applied Younger outside these three \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d categories, and rules, in accord with NOPSI, that they define Younger\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSI\xe2\x80\x99s three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger abstention.  The first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character, and which did not touch on a state court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its judicial function.  Nor is the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order an act of civil enforcement of the kind to which Younger has been extended.  The IUB proceeding is not \xe2\x80\x9cakin to a criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604.  Nor was it initiated by \xe2\x80\x9cthe State in its sovereign capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trainor v. Hernandez, \n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 434\n, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn., \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 423\n\xe2\x80\x93434.  Rather, the action was initiated by Sprint, a private corporation.  No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s activities or lodged a formal complaint against Sprint.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administrative proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essentially, a civil enforcement action.  However, the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicative authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Circuit misinterpreted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Middlesex to mean that Younger abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) \xe2\x80\x9can ongoing state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal] challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  In Middlesex, the Court invoked Younger to bar a federal court from entertaining a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to a state ethics committee\xe2\x80\x99s pending investigation of the lawyer.  Unlike the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding, however, the state ethics committee\xe2\x80\x99s hearing in Middlesex was plainly \xe2\x80\x9cakin to a criminal proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d: An investigation and formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the hearing\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for failing to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s professional conduct standards.  457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 433\xe2\x80\x93435.  The three Middlesex conditions invoked by the Court of Appeals were therefore not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Younger.  Younger extends to the three \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d identified in NOPSI, but no further.

Each seeks review of an Iowa Utilities Board (IUB or Board) order.  And each presents the question whether Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, may impose on Sprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), intrastate access charges for telephone calls transported via the Internet.  Federal-court jurisdiction over controversies of this kind was confirmed in Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635 (2002)\n.  Invoking Younger v. Harris, \n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37 (1971)\n, the  U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa abstained from adjudicating Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s abstention decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  In the main, federal courts are obliged to decide cases within the scope of federal jurisdiction.  Abstention is not in order simply because a pending state-court proceeding involves the same subject matter.  New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, \n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350, \n373 (1989)\n (NOPSI) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no doctrine that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pendency of state judicial proceedings excludes the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has recognized, however, certain instances in which the prospect of undue interference with state proceedings counsels against federal relief.  See id., at 368.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYounger exemplifies one class of cases in which federal-court abstention is required: When there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding, federal courts must refrain from enjoining the state prosecution.  This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592 (1975)\n, or that implicate a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1987)\n.  We have cautioned, however, that federal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on the merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional grant, and should not \xe2\x80\x9crefus[e] to decide a case in deference to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  NOPSI, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCircumstances fitting within the Younger doctrine, we have stressed, are \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d; they include, as catalogued in NOPSI, \xe2\x80\x9cstate criminal prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccivil enforcement proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccivil proceedings involving certain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to perform their judicial functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 367\xe2\x80\x93368.  Because this case presents none of the circumstances the Court has ranked as \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d the general rule governs: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he pendency of an action in [a] state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800, \n817 (1976)\n (quoting McClellan v.

In 2009, however, Sprint decided to withhold payment for a subset of those calls, classified as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In response, Windstream threatened to block all calls to and from Sprint customers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSprint filed a complaint against Windstream with the IUB asking the Board to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint.  In Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s view, Iowa law entitled it to withhold payment while it contested the access charges and prohibited Windstream from carrying out its disconnection threat.  In answer to Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, Windstream retracted its threat to discontinue serving Sprint, and Sprint moved, successfully, to withdraw its complaint.  Because the conflict between Sprint and Windstream over VoIP calls was \xe2\x80\x9clikely to recur,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the IUB decided to continue the proceedings to resolve the underlying legal question, i.e., whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.  Order in Sprint Communications Co. v. Iowa Telecommunications Servs., Inc., No. FCU\xe2\x80\x932010\xe2\x80\x930001 (IUB, Feb. 1, 2010), p.\xc2\xa06 (IUB Order).  The question retained by the IUB, Sprint argued, was governed by federal law, and was not within the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicative jurisdiction.  The IUB disagreed, ruling that the intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeeking to overturn the Board\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, Sprint commenced two lawsuits.  First, Sprint sued the members of the IUB (respondents here)\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t in their official capacities in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.  In its federal-court complaint, Sprint sought a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s decision; as relief, Sprint requested an injunction against enforcement of the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Second, Sprint petitioned for review of the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order in Iowa state court.  The state petition reiterated the preemption argument Sprint made in its federal-court complaint; in addition, Sprint asserted state law and procedural due process claims.  Because Eighth Circuit precedent effectively required a plaintiff to exhaust state remedies before proceeding to federal court, see Alleghany Corp. v. McCartney, 896 F.\xc2\xa02d 1138 (1990), Sprint urges that it filed the state suit as a protective measure.  Failing to do so, Sprint explains, risked losing the opportunity to obtain any review, federal or state, should the federal court decide to abstain after the expiration of the Iowa statute of limitations.  See Brief for Petitioner 7\xe2\x80\x938.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs Sprint anticipated, the IUB filed a motion asking the Federal District Court to abstain in light of the state suit, citing Younger v. Harris, \n\n401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37 (1971)\n.  The District Court granted the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s motion and dismissed the suit.  The IUB\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and the pending state-court review of it, the District Court said, composed one \xe2\x80\x9cuninterruptible process\xe2\x80\x9d implicating important state interests.  On that ground, the court ruled, Younger abstention was in order.  Sprint Communications Co. v. Berntsen, No. 4:11\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300183\xe2\x80\x93JAJ (SD Iowa, Aug. 1, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the most part, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  The Court of Appeals rejected the argument, accepted by several of its sister courts, that Younger abstention is appropriate only when the parallel state proceedings are \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cremedial,\xe2\x80\x9d in nature.  690 F.\xc2\xa03d 864, 868 (2012); cf. Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-G\xc3\xb3mez, 585 F.\xc2\xa03d 508, 522 (CA1 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]roceedings must be coercive, and in most cases, state-initiated, in order to warrant abstention.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, the Eighth Circuit read this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent to require Younger abstention whenever \xe2\x80\x9can ongoing state judicial proceeding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. implicates important state interests, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the state proceedings provide adequate opportunity to raise [federal] challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  690 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 867 (citing Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn., \n\n457 U.\xc2\xa0S. 423, \n432 (1982)\n).  Those criteria were satisfied here, the appeals court held, because the ongoing state-court review of the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s decision concerned Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimportant state interest in regulating and enforcing its intrastate utility rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  690 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 868.  Recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility that the parties [might] return to federal court,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the Court of Appeals vacated the judgment dismissing Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  In lieu of dismissal, the Eighth Circuit remanded the case, instructing the District Court to enter a stay during the pendency of the state-court action.

We had \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt that federal courts ha[d federal question] jurisdiction under [28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa71331 to entertain such a suit,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 642, and nothing in the Telecommunications Act detracted from that conclusion, see id., at 643.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederal courts, it was early and famously said, have \xe2\x80\x9cno more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).  Jurisdiction existing, this Court has cautioned, a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobligation\xe2\x80\x9d to hear and decide a case is \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unflagging.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800, \n817 (1976)\n.  Parallel state-court proceedings do not detract from that obligation.  See ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Younger, we recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cfar-from-novel\xe2\x80\x9d exception to this general rule.  New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, \n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350, \n364 (1989)\n (NOPSI).  The plaintiff in Younger sought federal-court adjudication of the constitutionality of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.  Requesting an injunction against the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement, the federal-court plaintiff was at the time the defendant in a pending state criminal prosecution under the Act.  In those circumstances, we said, the federal court should decline to enjoin the prosecution, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid state statute.  See 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  Abstention was in order, we explained, under \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic doctrine of equity jurisprudence that courts of equity should not act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irreparably injury if denied equitable relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]estraining equity jurisdiction within narrow limits,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed, would \xe2\x80\x9cprevent erosion of the role of the jury and avoid a duplication of legal proceedings and legal sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44.  We explained as well that this doctrine was \xe2\x80\x9creinforced\xe2\x80\x9d by the notion of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98comity,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, a proper respect for state functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have since applied Younger to bar federal relief in certain civil actions.  Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592 (1975)\n, is the pathmarking decision.  There, Ohio officials brought a civil action in state court to abate the showing of obscene movies in Pursue\xe2\x80\x99s theater.  Because the State was a party and the proceeding was \xe2\x80\x9cin aid of and closely related to [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] criminal statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held Younger abstention appropriate.  Id., at 604.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore recently, in NOPSI, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368, the Court had occasion to review and restate our Younger jurisprudence.  NOPSI addressed and rejected an argument that a federal court should refuse to exercise jurisdiction to review a state council\xe2\x80\x99s ratemaking decision.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly ex- ceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d we reaffirmed, \xe2\x80\x9cjustify a fed- eral court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to decide a case in deference to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Those \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exist, the Court determined after surveying prior decisions, in three types of proceedings.  First, Younger precluded federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.  See ibid.   Second, certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil enforcement proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d warranted abstention.  Ibid. (citing, e.g., Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604).  Finally, federal courts refrained from interfering with pending \xe2\x80\x9ccivil proceedings involving certain orders .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to perform their judicial functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368 (citing Juidice v. Vail, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327\n, n.\xc2\xa012 (1977), and Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n13 (1987)\n).  We have not applied Younger outside these three \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d categories, and today hold, in accord with NOPSI, that they define Younger\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe IUB does not assert that the Iowa state court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the Board decision, considered alone, implicates Younger.  Rather, the initial administrative proceeding justifies staying any action in federal court, the IUB contends, until the state review process has concluded.  The same argument was advanced in NOPSI.  491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368.  We will assume without deciding, as the Court did in NOPSI, that an administrative adjudication and the subsequent state court\xe2\x80\x99s review of it count as a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary process\xe2\x80\x9d for Younger purposes.  Id., at 369.  The question remains, however, whether the initial IUB proceeding is of the \xe2\x80\x9csort .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. entitled to Younger treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe IUB proceeding, we conclude, does not fall within any of the three exceptional categories described in NOPSI and therefore does not trigger Younger abstention.  The first and third categories plainly do not accommodate the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding.  That proceeding was civil, not criminal in character, and it did not touch on a state court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its judicial function.  Cf. Juidice, 430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 336, n.\xc2\xa012 (civil contempt order); Pennzoil, 481 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 13 (requirement for posting bond pending appeal).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does the IUB\xe2\x80\x99s order rank as an act of civil enforcement of the kind to which Younger has been extended.  Our decisions applying Younger to instances of civil enforcement have generally concerned state proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cakin to a criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cimportant respects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604.  See also Middlesex, 457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 432 (Younger abstention appropriate where \xe2\x80\x9cnoncriminal proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings criminal in nature\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such enforcement actions are characteristically initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff, i.e., the party challenging the state action, for some wrongful act.  See, e.g., Middlesex, 457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (state-initiated disciplinary proceedings against lawyer for violation of state ethics rules).  In cases of this genre, a state actor is routinely a party to the state proceeding and often initiates the action.  See, e.g., Ohio Civil Rights Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619 (1986)\n (state-initiated administrative proceedings to enforce state civil rights laws); Moore v. Sims, \n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415\n\xe2\x80\x93420 (1979) (state-initiated proceeding to gain custody of children allegedly abused by their parents); Trainor v. Hernandez, \n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 434, \n444 (1977)\n (civil proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cbrought by the State in its sovereign capacity\xe2\x80\x9d to recover welfare payments defendants had allegedly obtained by fraud); Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598 (state-initiated proceeding to enforce obscenity laws).  Investigations are commonly involved, often culminating in the filing of a formal complaint or charges.  See, e.g., Dayton, 477 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 624 (noting preliminary investigation and complaint); Middlesex, 457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 433 (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe IUB proceeding does not resemble the state enforcement actions this Court has found appropriate for Younger abstention.  It is not \xe2\x80\x9cakin to a criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604.  Nor was it initiated by \xe2\x80\x9cthe State in its sovereign capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Trainor, 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444.  A private corporation, Sprint, initiated the action.  No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s activities, and no state actor lodged a formal complaint against Sprint.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn its brief, the IUB emphasizes Sprint\xe2\x80\x99s decision to withdraw the complaint that commenced proceedings before the Board.  At that point, the IUB argues, Sprint was no longer a willing participant, and the proceedings became, essentially, a civil enforcement action.  See Brief for Respondents 31.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The IUB\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicative authority, however, was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private parties, not to sanction Sprint for commission of a wrongful act.  Although Sprint withdrew its complaint, administrative efficiency, not misconduct by Sprint, prompted the IUB to answer the underlying federal question.  By determining the intercarrier compensation regime applicable to VoIP calls, the IUB sought to avoid renewed litigation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute.  Because the underlying legal question remained unsettled, the Board observed, the controversy was \xe2\x80\x9clikely to recur.\xe2\x80\x9d  IUB Order 6.  Nothing here suggests that the IUB proceeding was \xe2\x80\x9cmore akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Huffman, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Circuit relied heavily on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Middlesex.  Younger abstention was warranted, the Court of Appeals read Middlesex to say, whenever three conditions are met:  There is (1) \xe2\x80\x9can ongoing state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal] challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  690 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 867 (citing Middlesex, 457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 432).  Before this Court, the IUB has endorsed the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  Brief for Respondents 13.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals and the IUB attribute to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Middlesex extraordinary breadth.  We invoked Younger in Middlesex to bar a federal court from entertaining a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to a New Jersey state ethics committee\xe2\x80\x99s pending investigation of the lawyer.  Unlike the IUB proceeding here, the state ethics committee\xe2\x80\x99s hearing in Middlesex was indeed \xe2\x80\x9cakin to a criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we noted, an investigation and formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for his failure to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s standards of professional conduct.  457 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 433\xe2\x80\x93435.  See also id., at 438 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cquasi-criminal nature of bar disciplinary proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  The three Middlesex conditions recited above were not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Younger.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDivorced from their quasi-criminal context, the three Middlesex conditions would extend Younger to virtually all parallel state and federal proceedings, at least where a party could identify a plausibly important state interest.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  That result is irreconcilable with our dominant instruction that, even in the presence of parallel state proceedings, abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the \xe2\x80\x9cexception, not the rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229, \n236 (1984)\n (quoting Colorado River, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 813).  In short, to guide other federal courts, we today clarify and affirm that Younger extends to the three \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d identified in NOPSI, but no further.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tReversed.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Federal Communications Commission has yet to provide its view on whether the Telecommunications Act categorically preempts intrastate access charges for VoIP calls.
