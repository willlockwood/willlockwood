Strictly speaking, this element of Younger is not available to mandate federal restraint in civil cases. But whatever may be the weight attached to this factor in civil litigation involving private parties, we deal here with a state proceeding which in important respects is more akin to a criminal proceeding than are most civil cases. The State is a party to the Court of Common Pleas proceeding, and the proceeding is both in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes. . . ." Id., at 604, 95 S.Ct. at 1208.</p></ul> <p> Accordingly, subsequent extensions of Younger in the civil context have occurred only when the State was directly involved in a pending state proceeding. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] The Fourth Circuit\'s invocation of Younger in this case, a " civil litigation involving private parties," represents a substantial broadening of the doctrine. </p><p> Second, the Court of Appeals held that deference was justified despite the fact that there was no on-going or pending state proceedings in the usual sense. Dismissal of the federal action was deemed appropriate because child custody orders in Virginia are subject to modification at any time and petitioner could follow that avenue in order to raise his constitutional claims. It is clear that, under the Court of Appeals reasoning, custody proceedings would never be final and petitioner would be forced to attempt to reopen state proceedings before receiving a hearing in federal court on any constitutional grounds. None of our Younger decisions contemplates this result, which, in effect, imposes an exhaus- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1115">Page 458 U.S. 1112 , 1115</a></p><p> tion requirement upon petitioner before he may bring a 1983 suit in federal court. Assertion of a federal claim under 1983, as a general matter, need not be preceded by an attempt to vindicate that claim in state court. McNeese v. Board of Education, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/668/case.html#672">373 U.S. 668, 672</a>, 1435 (1963). Although there are recognized exceptions when "strands of local law are woven into the case" whose resolution should precede consideration by a federal court, id., at 673, this is not suggested to be such a case. Moreover, if it were, the District Court should refrain temporarily from exercising its jurisdiction, but should not dismiss the case outright. See Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U.S. 496</a> (1941). </p><p> A case of this type has not previously been thought to fall within the reach of the Younger doctrine. Obviously, the extension of Younger to pending civil suits between private litigants is not a party is an issue requiring ultimate resolution by this Court. Indeed, the applicability of Younger to all civil litigation is a question that has expressly been reserved for another day on no less than four occasions. Moore v. Sims, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/415/case.html">442 U.S. 415</a>, 423, n. 8, 2377, n. 8 (1979); Trainor v.
