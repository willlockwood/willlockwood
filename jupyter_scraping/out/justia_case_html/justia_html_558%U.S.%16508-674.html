FERC and New England\xe2\x80\x99s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made several attempts to address the problem.  This case arises from the latest effort to design a solution.  Concerned parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, <em>inter alia, </em>established rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and provided that the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>public interest standard would govern rate challenges.  FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it presents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public interest.  Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC\xe2\x80\x99s approval order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate is brought by noncontracting third parties, <em>Mobile-Sierra</em>\xe2\x80\x99s public interest standard does not apply.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks FERC investigation.

Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Morgan Stanley </em>did not reach the question presented here, but its reasoning strongly suggests that the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding misperceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine.  Announced three months after the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 disposition in this case, <em>Morgan Stanley</em> reaffirmed <em>Mobile-Sierra</em>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to FERC to \xe2\x80\x9cpresume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated \xe2\x80\xa6 contract meets the \xe2\x80\x98just and reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d unless \xe2\x80\x9cFERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___.  The <em>Morgan Stanley</em> opinion makes it unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with, the \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  Rather, the public interest standard defines \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.  And if FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may not escape that presumption.  Moreover, the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a contract rate that \xe2\x80\x9cseriously harms the consuming public.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___.  Finally, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s confinement of <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s animating purpose: promotion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mobile</em>, 350 U.

A presumption applicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as to everyone else\xe2\x80\x94consumers, advocacy groups, state utility commissions, elected officials acting <em>parens patriae</em>\xe2\x80\x94could scarcely provide the stability <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> aimed to secure.

In 2006, after several attempts by the Commission and concerned parties to address the problems, FERC approved a comprehensive settlement agreement (hereinafter Settlement Agreement or Agreement).  Most relevant here, the Agreement established rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity, and provided that the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>public interest standard would govern rate challenges.  Parties who opposed the settlement petitioned for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  Among multiple objections to FERC\xe2\x80\x99s order approving the Agreement, the settlement opponents urged that the rate challenges of nonsettling parties should not be controlled by the restrictive <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>public interest standard.<em> </em>The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a rate challenge is brought by a non-contracting third party, the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine simply does not apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Maine Pub.

Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, made clear that the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>public interest standard is not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable standard; it is an application of that standard in the context of rates set by contract.  The \xe2\x80\x9cvenerable <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d rests on \xe2\x80\x9cthe stabilizing force of contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19); see <em>id.,</em> at 22 (describing contract rates as \xe2\x80\x9ca key source of stability\xe2\x80\x9d).  To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC itself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting as well as contracting parties.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale energy market, an electricity provider purchases from a generator an option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than purchasing the energy itself.  To maintain the reliability of the grid, electricity providers generally purchase more capacity, <em>i.e.</em>, rights to acquire energy, than necessary to meet their customers\xe2\x80\x99 anticipated demand.  For many years in New England, the supply of capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region\xe2\x80\x99s demand.  FERC and New England\xe2\x80\x99s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made several attempts to address this problem.  This case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into \xe2\x80\x9creliability must-run\xe2\x80\x9d agreements with the New England Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates the region\xe2\x80\x99s transmission system.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In its orders addressing those agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a new market mechanism that would set prices separately for various geographical sub-regions.  <em>Devon Power LLC</em>, 103 FERC \xc2\xb661,082, pp.\xc2\xa061,266, 61,271 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure responsive to FERC\xe2\x80\x99s directions.  See <em>Devon Power LLC</em>, 107 FERC \xc2\xb661,240, p.\xc2\xa062,020 (2004).  FERC set the matter for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.  <em>Devon Power LLC</em>, 111 FERC \xc2\xb663,063, p.\xc2\xa065,205 (2005).  Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s order; on September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard arguments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter established settlement procedures.  <em>Devon Power LLC</em>, 113 FERC \xc2\xb661,075, p.\xc2\xa061,271 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a settlement was reached.  Of the 115 negotiating parties, only 8 opposed the settlement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Settlement Agreement installed a \xe2\x80\x9cforward capacity market\xe2\x80\x9d under which annual auctions would set capacity prices; auctions would be conducted three years in advance of the time when the capacity would be needed.  <em>Devon Power LLC</em>,<em> </em>115 FERC \xc2\xb661,340, pp.\xc2\xa062,304, 62,306\xe2\x80\x9362,308 (2006).  Each energy provider would be required to purchase enough capacity to meet its share of the \xe2\x80\x9cinstalled capacity requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the minimum level of capacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as determined by the ISO.  <em>Id.,</em> at 62,307.  For the three-year gap between the first auction and the time when the capacity procured in that auction would be provided,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the Agreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period payments to capacity-supplying generators.  <em>Id.,</em> at 62,308\xe2\x80\x9362,309.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue before us centers on \xc2\xa74.C of the Agreement (hereinafter <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>provision).  Under that provision, challenges to both transition-period payments and auction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98public interest\xe2\x80\x99 standard of review set forth in <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co.</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Mobile Gas Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/332/index.html">350 U.

But the objectors prevailed on the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>issue: The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held that <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>applies only to contracting parties.  <em>Id.,</em> at 478.  In this Court, the parties have switched places.  Defenders of the settlement, including the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>provision, are petitioners; objectors to the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only on the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>issue, are respondents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of our recent decision in <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, we granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: \xe2\x80\x9c[Does] <em>Mobile-Sierra</em>\xe2\x80\x99s public-interest standard appl[y] when a contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a party to the contract[?]\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners i.  Satisfied that the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment insofar as it rejected application of <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>to noncontracting parties.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the \xe2\x80\x9csale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824(b)(1).  The Act allows regulated utilities to set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and buyers may agree on rates by contract.  See \xc2\xa7824d(c), (d).  Whether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must be \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7824d(a).  Rates may be examined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own initiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed or after a rate goes into effect.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7824d(e), 824e(a).  Following a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate found \xe2\x80\x9cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,\xe2\x80\x9d and replace it with a just and reasonable rate.  \xc2\xa7824e(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine originated in twin decisions announced on the same day in 1956: <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co.</em> v. <em>Mobile Gas Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/332/index.html">350 U. S. 332</a>, and <em>FPC</em> v. <em>Sierra Pacific Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/348/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/348/index.html">350 U. S. 348</a>.  Both concerned rates set by contract rather than by tariff.  <em>Mobile </em>involved the Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utilities to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7717c(c).  In <em>Mobile</em>, we rejected a gas utility\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the file-all-new-rates requirement authorized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a purchaser simply by filing a new tariff.  350 U. S., at 336\xe2\x80\x93337.  Filing, we explained, was a <em>precondition </em>to changing a rate, not an <em>authorization </em>to do so in violation of a lawful contract.  <em>Id.,</em> at 339\xe2\x80\x93344; see <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Sierra</em> case involved a further issue.  Not only had the Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed tariff superseded a contract rate.  In addition, the Commission had suggested that, in any event, the contract rate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust and unreasonable.  The Commission thought that was so \xe2\x80\x9csolely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair return on the [utility\xe2\x80\x99s] net invested capital.\xe2\x80\x9d  350 U. S., at 355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion prompted this Court to home in on \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of how the Commission may evaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  The <em>Sierra </em>Court answered the question this way:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Commission\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion appears on its face to be based on an erroneous standard\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [W]hile it may be that the Commission may not normally <em>impose</em> upon a public utility a rate which would produce less than a fair return, it does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. In such circumstances <em>the sole concern of the Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest</em>\xe2\x80\x94as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service, cast upon other consumers an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  350 U. S., at 354\xe2\x80\x93355 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThe regulatory system created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised by the regulated companies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/747/index.html">390 U.

S. ___, the Court reaffirmed and clarified the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine.  That case presented two questions: First, does the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated between sophisticated parties meet the just and reasonable standard imposed by 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824d(a)) \xe2\x80\x9capply only when FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a contract rate without the presumption?\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  \xe2\x80\x9cSecond, does the presumption [generally] impose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of wholesale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932); see <em>id., </em>at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Answering no to the first question and yes to the second, the Court emphasized the essential role of contracts as a key factor fostering stability in the electricity market, to the longrun benefit of consumers.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 19, 22); see, <em>e.g.,</em> Market-Based Rates \xc2\xb66, 72 Fed.

Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s negative answer misperceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In unmistakably plain language, <em>Morgan Stanley </em>restated <em>Mobile-Sierra</em>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to the Commission: FERC \xe2\x80\x9cmust presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the \xe2\x80\x98just and reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 requirement imposed by law.  The presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  As our instruction to FERC in <em>Morgan Stanley </em>conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and sometimes at odds with, the \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d standard, see 520 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 478; rather, the public interest standard defines \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  And if FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can it be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless may escape that presumption?\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine does not overlook third-party interests; it is framed with a view to their protection.  The doctrine directs the Commission to reject a contract rate that \xe2\x80\x9cseriously harms the consuming public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); see <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/467/index.html">535 U.

Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s confinement of <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose of the doctrine: promotion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mobile</em>, 350 U. S., at 344.  That dominant concern was expressed by FERC in the order on review: \xe2\x80\x9cStability is particularly important in this case, which was initiated in part because of the unstable nature of [installed capacity] revenues and the effect that has on generating units, particularly those \xe2\x80\xa6 critical to maintaining reliability.\xe2\x80\x9d  115 FERC, at 62,335.  A presumption applicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as to everyone else\xe2\x80\x94consumers, advocacy groups, state utility commissions, elected officials acting <em>parens patriae</em>\xe2\x80\x94could scarcely provide the stability <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> aimed to secure.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks FERC investigation.  The presumption is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties.  It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by third parties.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The objectors to the settlement appearing before us maintain that the rates at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94the auction rates and the transition payments\xe2\x80\x94are prescriptions of general applicability rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccontractually negotiated rates,\xe2\x80\x9d hence <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> is inapplicable.  See Brief for Respondents 15\xe2\x80\x9317, and n.\xc2\xa01 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Only if the rate was so low that the seller might be unable to stay in business, thereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be excused from performing its contract.  That is what the Court held in <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co.</em> v. <em>Mobile Gas Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/332/index.html">350 U.

The Court held the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a contract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it saddled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be considered unjust and unreasonable under normal market conditions, unless the purchaser could also prove that \xe2\x80\x9cthe contract seriously harms the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Util.

And that presumption, according to the Court, is a simple application of the just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates, not a different standard of review.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (rejecting the \xe2\x80\x9cobviously indefensible proposition that a standard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable standard applies to contract rates\xe2\x80\x9d).  But applying the presumption nonetheless sets a higher bar for a rate challenge.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  FERC may abrogate the rate only if the public interest is <em>seriously</em> harmed.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 22) (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> presumption, setting aside a contract rate requires a finding of \xe2\x80\x98unequivocal public necessity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/747/index.html">390 U.

Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), all wholesale electricity rates must be \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824d(a).  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in the statute mandates differing application of the statutory standard to rates set by contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).  And the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> line of cases did not \xe2\x80\x9cmandate a \xe2\x80\x98serious harm\xe2\x80\x99 standard of review,\xe2\x80\x9d much less \xe2\x80\x9crequire any assumption that high rates and low rates impose symmetric burdens on the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley, </em>554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statement in <em>Permian Basin</em> about \xe2\x80\x98unequivocal public necessity,\xe2\x80\x99 390 U. S., at 822, speaks to the difficulty of establishing injury to the public interest in the context of a low-rate challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, one brought by sellers of electricity.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 8).  It does not establish a new standard that applies as well to a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-rate challenge\xe2\x80\x9d brought by purchasers.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even accepting <em>Morgan Stanley </em>as the law, the Court unwisely goes further today.  In this third chapter of the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> story, the Court applies a rule\xe2\x80\x94one designed initially to protect the enforceability of freely negotiated contracts against parties who seek a release from their obligations\xe2\x80\x94to impose a special burden on third parties exercising their statutory right to object to unjust and unreasonable rates.  This application of the rule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set forth in the first chapter of this tale.  As the Court of Appeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court sets aside today: \xe2\x80\x9cThis case is clearly outside the scope of the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Maine Pub. Util. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 520 F.\xc2\xa03d 464, 477 (CADC 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit noted,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ourts have rarely mentioned the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine without reiterating that it is premised on the existence of a voluntary contract between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But, the Court asks, \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can it be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless may escape that presumption?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of <em>Sierra</em> provides an answer.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Sierra </em>was grounded in the commonsense notion that \xe2\x80\x98[i]n wholesale markets, the party charging the rate and the party charged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying presumptively equal bargaining power, who could be expected to negotiate a \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d rate <em>as between the two of them</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (quoting <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/467/index.html">535 U. S. 467</a>, 479 (2002); emphasis added).  This \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense notion\xe2\x80\x9d supports the rule requiring FERC to apply a presumption against letting a party out of its own contract, as the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit recognized.  520 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 478 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine applies a more deferential standard of review to preserve the terms of the bargain as between the contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d).  It does not, however, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a presumption against abrogating any rate set by contract, even when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be required in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court further reasons that \xe2\x80\x9cconfinement of <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose of the doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d which is ensuring the stability of contract-based supply arrangements.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Maybe so, but applying <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> to rate challenges by noncontracting parties loses sight of the animating purpose of the FPA, which is \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection of the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sierra</em>, 350 U. S., at 355.  That interest is \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest of consumers in paying \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe lowest possible reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Permian Basin</em>, 390 U. S., at 793).  I do not doubt that stable energy markets are important to the public interest, but \xe2\x80\x9cunder the FPA, Congress has charged FERC, not the courts, with balancing the short-term and long-term interests of consumers\xe2\x80\x9d under the just-and-reasonable standard of review.  <em>Morgan Stanley, </em>554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The Court today imposes additional limits upon FERC\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect that interest.  If a third-party wholesale buyer can show a rate harms the public interest (perhaps because it is too high to be just and reasonable under normal review), but cannot show it <em>seriously</em> harms the public, FERC may do nothing about it.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court assures respondents that the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest standard\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9coverlook third-party interests\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cframed with a view to their protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, 9.  Perhaps in practice the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine will protect third parties\xe2\x80\x99 interests, and the public interest, just as well as the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d just-and-reasonable standard.  But respondents are rightly skeptical.  The <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine, as interpreted by the Court in <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, must pose a higher bar to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 rate challenge\xe2\x80\x94that is, it requires them to show greater harm to the public.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Otherwise, it would hardly serve to protect contract stability better than the plain vanilla just-and-reasonable standard and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Morgan Stanley</em> would have little effect.  Furthermore, the Court today reiterates that the doctrine poses a high bar.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was sensible to require a contracting party to show something more than its own desire to get out of what proved to be a bad bargain before FERC could abrogate the parties\xe2\x80\x99 bargain.  It is not sensible, nor authorized by the statute, for the Court to change the <em>de facto</em> standard of review whenever a rate is set by private contract, based solely on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that contract stability should be preserved unless there is extraordinary harm to the public interest.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Whether the Court explains the <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> doctrine as a presumption or as a different standard of review, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no significant difference between requiring a heightened showing to overcome an otherwise conclusive presumption and imposing a heightened standard of review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan Stanley,</em> 554 U.

But I note the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine protects \xe2\x80\x9cthird-party interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 9, is a new twist on the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest standard\xe2\x80\x9d as traditionally understood.  As the Court recognized in <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, one consequence of applying <em>Mobile-Sierra</em> is that<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the sole concern of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is the public interest, and FERC cannot consider, for example, whether a rate guarantees a sufficient rate of return to a regulated entity.  554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting <em>FPC</em> v. <em>Sierra Pacific Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/348/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/348/index.html">350 U. S. 348</a>, 355 (1956)); see also <em>Morgan Stanley</em>, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17, n.\xc2\xa03).  In addition to requiring that FERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be required under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore, the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine leaves little room for respondents\xe2\x80\x94at least one of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase electricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self-supplies its capacity\xe2\x80\x94to assert their private interest in making a rate challenge.  The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under the public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates between allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale customers, <em>ante</em>, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still have to show that circumstance harmed the public interest.  It remains unclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell electricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest standard\xe2\x80\x9d because the rate is detrimental to that entity\xe2\x80\x99s private interest.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
