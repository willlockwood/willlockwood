Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span>, followed.  As to other issues, appeal dismissed for want of properly presented federal questions.</p>\n<p>160 So.2d 97 reversed in part, appeal dismissed in part.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>The motion to use the record in No. 520, October Term 1962, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/487/case.html">374 U. S. 487</a></span>, is granted.  The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed with respect to the issues of the constitutionality of prayer, and of devotional Bible reading pursuant to a Florida statute, Fla.Stat. (1961) \xc2\xa7 231.09, in the public schools of Dade County.  <em>School District of Abington Township v. Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span>.  As to the other questions raised, the appeal is dismissed for want of properly presented federal questions.  <em>Asbury Hospital v. Cass County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/207/case.html">326 U. S. 207</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/207/case.html#213">326 U. S. 213</a></span>-214.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK agrees, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>I join in reversing the Supreme Court of Florida on the main issue in the case.</p>\n<p>The "other questions raised" which the Court refuses to consider because not "properly presented" involve the constitutionality under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of baccalaureate services in the schools, a religious </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 377 U. S. 403</a></p><p> census among pupils, and a religious test for teachers.  The Florida Supreme Court disposed of those issues on the authority of <em>Doremus v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/case.html">342 U. S. 429</a></span>, which held that a taxpayer lacks standing to challenge religious exercises in the public schools.  Irrespective of <em>Doremus v. Board of Education, supra,</em> I think it is arguable that appellant taxpayers do have standing to challenge these practices.</p>\n<p>I think, however, that two of those "other questions" -- the baccalaureate services and the religious census -- do not present substantial federal questions, and so I concur in the dismissal of the appeal as to them.  As to the religious test for teachers, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/402/case.html">*</a></span> I think a substantial question is presented.  <em>Cf. Torcaso v. Watkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/488/case.html">367 U. S. 488</a></span>.  I would therefore put that question down for argument, postponing the question or jurisdiction to the merits.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART would note probable jurisdiction of this appeal and set it down for argument on the merits.</p>\n<p>* Applicants for teaching positions are required to answer the question, "Do you believe in God?"  Religious attitudes are also considered in making promotions.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
