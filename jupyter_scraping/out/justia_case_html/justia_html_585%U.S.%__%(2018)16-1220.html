The Chinese sellers moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Chinese law required them to fix the price and quantity of vitamin C exports, thus shielding them from liability under U.\xc2\xa0S. antitrust law.  The Ministry of Commerce of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China (Ministry) filed an <i>amicus </i>brief in support of the motion, explaining that it is the administrative authority authorized to regulate foreign trade, and stating that the alleged conspiracy in restraint of trade was actually a pricing regime mandated by the Chinese Government.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers countered that the Ministry had identified no law or regulation ordering the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 price agreement, highlighted a publication announcing that the Chinese sellers had agreed to control the quantity and rate of exports without government intervention, and presented supporting expert testimony.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The District Court denied the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion in relevant part, concluding that it did not regard the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s statements as \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly in light of the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 evidence.  When the Chinese sellers subsequently moved for summary judgment, the Ministry submitted another statement, reiterating its stance, and the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers pointed to<i> </i>China\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the World Trade Organization that it ended its export administration of vitamin C in 2002.  The court denied this motion as well.  The case was then tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Second Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court erred by denying the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the complaint.  When a foreign government whose law is in contention submits an official statement on the meaning and interpretation of its domestic law, the court concluded, federal courts are \xe2\x80\x9cbound to defer\xe2\x80\x9d to the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of its own law, whenever that construction is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Inspecting only the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s brief and the sources cited therein, the court found the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s account of Chinese law \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A federal court determining foreign law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 should accord respectful consideration to a foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s submission, but the court is not bound to accord conclusive effect to the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s statements.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Rule 44.1 fundamentally changed the mode of determining foreign law in federal courts.  Before adoption of the rule in 1966, a foreign nation\xe2\x80\x99s laws had to be \xe2\x80\x9cproved as facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Talbot</i> v. <i>Seeman</i>, 1 Cranch 1, 38.  Rule 44.1, in contrast, specifies that a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of foreign law \xe2\x80\x9cmust be treated as a ruling on a question of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in ascertaining foreign law, courts are not limited to materials submitted by the parties, but \xe2\x80\x9cmay consider any relevant material or source.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appellate review, as is true of domestic law determinations, is <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>.  The purpose of these changes was to align, to the extent possible, the process for determining alien law and the process for determining domestic law.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Neither Rule 44.1 nor any other rule or statute addresses the weight a federal court determining foreign law should give to the views presented by a foreign government.  In the spirit of \xe2\x80\x9cinternational comity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 Nationale Industrielle A\xc3\xa9rospatiale</i> v. <i>United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522, 543, and n.\xc2\xa027, a federal court should carefully consider a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s views about the meaning of its own laws.  The appropriate weight in each case, however, will depend upon the circumstances; a federal court is neither bound to adopt the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization nor required to ignore other relevant materials.  No single formula or rule will fit all cases, but relevant considerations include the statement\xe2\x80\x99s clarity, thoroughness, and support; its context and purpose; the transparency of the foreign legal system; the role and authority of the entity or official offering the statement; and the statement\xe2\x80\x99s consistency with the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s past positions.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Judged in this light, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s unyielding rule is inconsistent with Rule 44.1 and, tellingly, with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of analogous submissions from States of the United States.  If the relevant state law is established by a decision of \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court,\xe2\x80\x9d that decision is \xe2\x80\x9cbinding on the federal courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Wainwright</i> v. <i>Goode</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78, 84, but views of the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, while attracting \xe2\x80\x9crespectful consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d do not garner controlling weight, <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43, 76\xe2\x80\x9377, n.\xc2\xa030.  Furthermore, because the Second Circuit riveted its attention on the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s submission, it did not address evidence submitted by the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers.  The court also misperceived the pre-Rule 44.1 decision of<i> United States</i> v. <i>Pink</i>,\n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203.  Under the particular circumstances of that case, this Court found conclusive a declaration from the government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic on the extraterritorial effect of a decree nationalizing assets: The declaration was <i>obtained by the United States</i> through official \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic channels,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 218; there was no indication that the declaration was inconsistent with the Russian Government\xe2\x80\x99s past statements; and the declaration was consistent with expert evidence in point.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Second Circuit expressed concern about reciprocity, but the United States has not historically argued that foreign courts are <i>bound</i> to accept its characterizations or precluded from considering other relevant sources.  International practice is also inconsistent with the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rigid rule.

Because the Second Circuit ordered dismissal of this case on the ground that the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s statements could not be gainsaid, we vacate that court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case for further consideration.</p><p>I</p><p>Petitioners, U.\xc2\xa0S.-based purchasers of vitamin C (hereinafter U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers), filed a class-action suit against four Chinese corporations that manufacture and export the nutrient (hereinafter Chinese sellers).  The U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers alleged that the Chinese sellers, two of whom are respondents here, had agreed to fix the price and quantity of vitamin C exported to the United States from China, in violation of \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act,15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  More particularly, the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers stated that the Chinese sellers had formed a cartel \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitated by the efforts of their trade association,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chamber of Commerce of Medicines and Health Products Importers and Exporters (Chamber).  Complaint in No. 1:05\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93453, Docket No. 1, \xc2\xb643.  The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the instant case and related suits for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</p><p>The Chinese sellers moved to dismiss the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 complaint on the ground that Chinese law required them to fix the price and quantity of vitamin C exports.  Therefore, the Chinese sellers urged, they are shielded from liability under U.\xc2\xa0S. antitrust law by the act of state doctrine, the foreign sovereign compulsion doctrine, and principles of international comity.  The Ministry of Commerce of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China (Ministry) filed a brief as <i>amicus curiae</i> in support of the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion.  The Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s brief stated that the Ministry is \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest administrative authority in China authorized to regulate foreign trade,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 190a; that the Chamber is \xe2\x80\x9can entity under the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s direct and active supervision\xe2\x80\x9d and is authorized to regulate vitamin C exports, <i>id.,</i> at 196a; and that the conspiracy in restraint of trade alleged by the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers was in fact \xe2\x80\x9ca regulatory pricing regime mandated by the government of China,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 197a.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>In response, the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers disputed that Chinese law required the Chinese sellers to engage in price fixing.  Among other things, the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers noted that the Ministry had not identified any written law or regulation expressly ordering the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 price agreement.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  They also highlighted a Chamber announcement that the manufacturers \xe2\x80\x9cwere able to reach a self-regulated agreement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whereby they would voluntarily control the quantity and pace of exports .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without any government intervention.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 109.  In addition, the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers presented expert testimony that the Chinese Government\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of a Vitamin C Subcommittee within the Chamber did not necessarily mean that the subcommittee\xe2\x80\x99s price fixing was mandated by law.</p><p>The District Court denied the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the complaint in relevant part.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation</i>, 584 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 546, 559 (EDNY 2008).  That court acknowledged that the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s <i>amicus</i> brief was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to substantial deference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 557.  The court, however, did not regard the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s statements as \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizing particularly that the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers had submitted evidence suggesting that the price fixing was voluntary.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The record, the District Court determined, was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo ambiguous to foreclose further inquiry into the voluntariness of [the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99] actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 559.</p><p>After further discovery, focused on whether Chinese law compelled the Chinese sellers to enter into a price-fixing agreement, the Chinese sellers moved for summary judgment.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation</i>, 810 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 522, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (EDNY 2011).  The Ministry submitted an additional statement, reiterating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Ministry specifically charged the Chamber .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with the authority and responsibility .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for regulating, through consultation, the price of vitamin C manufactured for export.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 133.  The Chinese sellers tendered expert testimony in accord with the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s account, which stressed that the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of its own regulations and policies carries decisive weight under Chinese law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 142.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers, in response, cited further materials supporting their opposing view, including China\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it \xe2\x80\x9cgave up export administration of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. vitamin C\xe2\x80\x9d in 2002.  810 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 532 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Denying the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment, the District Court held that Chinese law did not require the sellers to fix the price or quantity of vitamin C exports.  <i>Id.,</i> at 525.</p><p>The case was then tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers.  The jury found that the Chinese sellers had agreed to fix the prices and quantities of vitamin C exports, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 276a\xe2\x80\x93279a, and further found that the Chinese sellers were not \xe2\x80\x9cactually compelled\xe2\x80\x9d by China to enter into those agreements, <i>id.,</i> at 278a.  In accord with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, the District Court entered judgment for the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers, awarding some $147 million in treble damages and enjoining the Chinese sellers from further violations of the Sherman Act.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court erred in denying the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the complaint.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation</i>, 837 F.\xc2\xa03d 175, 178, 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (2016).  The Court of Appeals determined that the propri- ety of dismissal hinged on whether the Chinese sellers could adhere to both Chinese law and U.\xc2\xa0S. antitrust law.  See <i>id.,</i> at 186.  That question, in turn, depended on \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of deference\xe2\x80\x9d owed to the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Chinese law.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Cognizant of \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting authority\xe2\x80\x9d on this question, <i>ibid., </i>the Court of Appeals settled on a highly deferential rule: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a foreign government, acting through counsel or otherwise, directly participates in U.\xc2\xa0S. court proceedings by providing a [statement] regarding the construction and effect of [the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s] laws and regulations, which is reasonable under the circumstances presented, a U.\xc2\xa0S. court is bound to defer to those statements,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 189.  The appeals court \xe2\x80\x9cnote[d] that[,] if the Chinese Government had not appeared in this litigation, the [D]istrict [C]ourt\xe2\x80\x99s careful and thorough treatment of the evidence before it in analyzing what Chinese law required at both the motion to dismiss and summary judgment stages would have been entirely appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 191, n.\xc2\xa010.</p><p>Applying its highly deferential rule, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s account of Chinese law was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  In so concluding, the Court of Appeals inspected only the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s brief and sources cited therein.  <i>Id.,</i> at 189\xe2\x80\x93190.  Because it thought that \xe2\x80\x9ca U.\xc2\xa0S. court [must] not embark on a challenge to a foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s official representation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 189, the Court of Appeals disregarded the submissions made by the U.\xc2\xa0S. purchasers casting doubt on the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s account of Chinese law, <i>id., </i>at 189\xe2\x80\x93190.  Based solely on the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s statements, the Court of Appeals held that \xe2\x80\x9cChinese law required [the Chinese sellers] to engage in activities in China that constituted antitrust violations here in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict over this question: Is a federal court determining foreign law under Rule 44.1 required to treat as conclusive a submission from the foreign government describing its own law?  583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>II</p><p>At common law, the content of foreign law relevant to a dispute was treated \xe2\x80\x9cas a question of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Miller, Federal Rule 44.1 and the \xe2\x80\x9cFact\xe2\x80\x9d Approach to Determining Foreign Law: Death Knell for a Die-Hard Doctrine, 65 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 613, 617\xe2\x80\x93619 (1967) (Miller).  In 1801, this Court endorsed the common-law rule, instructing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe laws of a foreign nation\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cproved as facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Talbot</i> v. <i>Seeman</i>, 1 Cranch 1, 38 (1801); see, <i>e.g., Church</i> v. <i>Hubbart</i>, 2 Cranch 187, 236 (1804) (\xe2\x80\x9cForeign laws are well understood to be facts.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Ranking questions of foreign law as questions of fact, however, \xe2\x80\x9chad a number of undesir- able practical consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  9A C. Wright &amp; A.

See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Rule 44.1 does not address the weight a federal court determining foreign law should give to the views presented by the foreign government.  See 837 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 187.  Nor does any other rule or statute.  In the spirit of \xe2\x80\x9cinternational comity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 Nationale Industrielle A\xc3\xa9rospatiale</i> v. <i>United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa</i>,482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522, 543, and n.\xc2\xa027 (1987), a federal court should carefully consider a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s views about the meaning of its own laws.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>McNab</i>, 331 F.\xc2\xa03d 1228, 1241 (CA11 2003); cf. <i>Bodum USA, Inc.</i> v. <i>La Cafeti\xc3\xa8re, Inc.</i>, 621 F.\xc2\xa03d 624, 638\xe2\x80\x93639 (CA7 2010) (Wood, J., concurring).  But the appropriate weight in each case will depend upon the circumstances; a federal court is neither bound to adopt the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization nor required to ignore other relevant materials.  When a foreign government makes conflicting statements, see <i>supra,</i> at 5, or, as here, offers an account in the context of litigation, there may be cause for caution in evaluating the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s submission.</p><p>Given the world\xe2\x80\x99s many and diverse legal systems, and the range of circumstances in which a foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s views may be presented, no single formula or rule will fit all cases in which a foreign government describes its own law.  Relevant considerations include the statement\xe2\x80\x99s clarity, thoroughness, and support; its context and purpose; the transparency of the foreign legal system; the role and authority of the entity or official offering the statement; and the statement\xe2\x80\x99s consistency with the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s past positions.</p><p>Judged in this light, the Court of Appeals erred in deeming the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s submission binding, so long as facially reasonable.  That unyielding rule is inconsistent with Rule 44.1 (determination of an issue of foreign law \xe2\x80\x9cmust be treated as a ruling on a question of law\xe2\x80\x9d; court may consider \xe2\x80\x9cany relevant material or source\xe2\x80\x9d) and, tellingly, with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of analogous submissions from States of the United States.  If the relevant state law is established by a decision of \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court,\xe2\x80\x9d that decision is \xe2\x80\x9cbinding on the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wainwright</i> v. <i>Goode</i>,464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 78, 84 (1983) (<i>per curiam</i>); see <i>Mullaney</i> v. <i>Wilbur</i>,421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 684, 691 (1975).  But views of the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, while attracting \xe2\x80\x9crespectful consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d do not garner controlling weight.  <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43, 76\xe2\x80\x9377, n.\xc2\xa030 (1997); see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.</i>,484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 393\xe2\x80\x93396 (1988).  Furthermore, because the Court of Appeals riveted its attention on the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s submission, it did not address other evidence, including, for example, China\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the WTO that China had \xe2\x80\x9cg[i]ve[n] up export administration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of vitamin C\xe2\x80\x9d at the end of 2001.  810 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 532 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>The Court of Appeals also misperceived this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pink</i>,315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203 (1942).  See 837 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 186\xe2\x80\x93187, 189.  <i>Pink</i>, properly comprehended, is not compelling authority for the attribution of controlling weight to the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s brief.  We note, first, that <i>Pink</i> was a pre-Rule 44.1 decision.  Second, <i>Pink</i> arose in unusual circumstances.  <i>Pink</i> was an action brought by the United States to recover assets of the U.\xc2\xa0S. branch of a Russian insurance company that had been nationalized in 1918, after the Russian revolution.  315 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 210\xe2\x80\x93211.  In 1933, the Soviet Government assigned the nationalized assets located in this country to the United States.  <i>Id.,</i> at 211\xe2\x80\x93212.  The disposition of the case turned on the extraterritorial effect of the nationalization decree\xe2\x80\x94specifically, whether the decree reached assets of the Russian insurance company located in the United States, or was instead limited to property in Russia.  <i>Id.,</i> at 213\xe2\x80\x93215, 217.  To support the position that the decree reached all of the company\xe2\x80\x99s assets, the United States obtained an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial declaration of the Commissariat for Justice\xe2\x80\x9d of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic.  <i>Id.,</i> at 218.  The declaration certified that the nationalization decree reached \xe2\x80\x9cthe funds and property of former insurance companies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. irrespective of whether [they were] situated within the territorial limits of [Russia] or abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 220 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence supported [a] finding\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commissariat for Justice ha[d] power to interpret existing Russian law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat being true,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded, the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial declaration [wa]s conclusive so far as the intended extraterritorial effect of the Russian decree [wa]s concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>This Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the Commissariat\xe2\x80\x99s submission as conclusive rested on a document <i>obtained by the United States</i>, through official \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic channels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 218.  There was no indication that the declaration was inconsistent with the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99s past statements.  Indeed, the Court emphasized that the declaration was consistent with expert evidence in point.  See <i>ibid.  </i>That the Commissariat\xe2\x80\x99s declaration was deemed \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d in the circumstances <i>Pink </i>presented scarcely suggests that all submissions by a foreign government are entitled to the same weight.</p><p>The Court of Appeals also reasoned that a foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of its own laws should be afforded \xe2\x80\x9cthe same respect and treatment that we would expect our government to receive in comparable matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  837 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 189.  The concern for reciprocity is sound, but it does not warrant the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.  Indeed, the United States, historically, has not argued that foreign courts are <i>bound</i> to accept its characterizations or precluded from considering other relevant sources.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>The understanding that a government\xe2\x80\x99s expressed view of its own law is ordinarily entitled to substantial but not conclusive weight is also consistent with two international treaties that establish formal mechanisms by which one government may obtain from another an official statement characterizing its laws.  Those treaties specify that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he information given in the reply shall not bind the judicial authority from which the request emanated.\xe2\x80\x9d  European Convention on Information on Foreign Law, Art. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 154; see Inter-American Convention on Proof of and Information on Foreign Law, Art. 6, May 8, 1979, O.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 1439 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 111 (similar).  Al- though the United States is not a party to those treaties, they reflect an international practice inconsistent with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbinding, if reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d resolution.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court was bound to defer to the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s brief, the court did not consider the shortcomings the District Court identified in the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s position or other aspects of \xe2\x80\x9cthe [D]istrict [C]ourt\xe2\x80\x99s careful and thorough treatment of the evidence before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  837 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 191, n.\xc2\xa010.  The correct interpretation of Chinese law is not before this Court, and we take no position on it.  But the materials identified by the District Court were at least relevant to the weight the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s submissions should receive and to the question whether Chinese law required the Chinese sellers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for renewed consideration consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Ministry told the District Court: For much of the 20th century, China allowed only state-owned entities to export products.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a.  When China started to allow private enterprises to obtain export licenses, the Ministry established the Chamber to regulate exports under the Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s authority and direction.  <i>Ibid.</i> In 1997, the Ministry authorized the establishment of the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s Vitamin C Subcommittee.  <i>Id.,</i> at 202a.  That year, the Ministry promulgated a regulation authorizing and requiring the subcommittee to limit the production of vitamin C for export and to set export prices.  <i>Id.,</i> at 202a\xe2\x80\x93204a.  Under the regulation delineating this \xe2\x80\x9cExport Licensing System,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ministry issued export licenses only to manufacturers whose export volume and price complied with the output quota and price coordinated by the Vitamin C Subcommittee.  <i>Id.,</i> at 204a. In 2002, the Ministry replaced the Export Licensing System with a \xe2\x80\x9cVerification and Chop System.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 208a.  As set forth in a 2002 Ministry Notice, the Chamber itself\xe2\x80\x94instead of the Ministry\xe2\x80\x94would inspect each export contract and certify its compliance with the coordinated quotas and price by affixing a special seal, known as a \xe2\x80\x9cchop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 208a\xe2\x80\x93209a.  China\xe2\x80\x99s Customs would allow export only if the exporter presented its contract bearing the Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 209a.  According to the Ministry, it was implicit in this arrangement that vitamin C exporters would remain under an obligation to fix prices and volumes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 208a.
