The bricks were suffered to remain in this state till the 14th of April 1799, when, on advertising them for sale, it was found that one of the defendants had sold them to Thomas Harrison, on the 1st of December 1798, without giving any notice of the levy. The sheriff at the time of the levy, employed a man to call at the brick-yard, occasionally, but did not keep any person constantly there; nor does it appear that T. Harrison had any notice of the bricks being subject to the above execution, until about the time of advertising them for sale. </p><p> The question proposed was, whether Harrison was entitled, under the circumstances of this case, to hold the bricks discharged altogether from the lien of the plaintiff\'s execution; or must account to the sheriff for the amount of the execution, not exceeding the value of the bricks?

But it would be going farther than the reason of our decisions, and might introduce collusion and fraud, if we were to authorise, or countenance, such a practice, indiscriminately, in every case. </p><p></p><p> By the COURT: </p><p> We are of opinion, therefore, that the purchaser of the bricks is entitled to hold them, entirely discharged from the lien of the execution. <a 1="" href="#F" name="T"> 1</a> </p><p></p><p> Morgan, for the plaintiff. </p><p> Hallowell, for Harrison. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> The manuscript of this note, was read on a recent trial, involving the same question; and the Judges intimated a doubt of its accuracy.
