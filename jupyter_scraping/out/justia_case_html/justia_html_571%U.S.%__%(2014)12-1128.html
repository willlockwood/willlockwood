Respondent Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators.  They have a licensing agreement that permits Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments, and that specifies procedures to identify products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the parties.  Pursuant to those procedures, Mirowski notified Medtronic of its belief that several of Medtronic\xe2\x80\x99s products infringed the licensed patents, and Medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringement in a declaratory judgment action, while accumulating disputed royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party.  The District Court concluded that Mirowski, as the party asserting infringement, had the burden of proving infringement and that Mirowski had not met that burden.  The Federal Circuit disagreed.  It acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof, but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant and, like Mirowski, is foreclosed from asserting an infringement counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agreement, the party seeking the declaratory judgment, namely Medtronic, bears the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        1.\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction in this case.

Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Utah v.

Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  Here, if Medtronic had acted consistent with the understanding of its rights that it seeks to establish through the declaratory judgment suit (by ceasing to pay royalties), Mirowski could terminate the license and bring a suit for infringement.  That suit would arise under federal patent law because \xe2\x80\x9cpatent law creates the cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp.,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n.  Thus, this declaratory judgment action, which avoids that hypothetical threatened action, also \xe2\x80\x9carises under\xe2\x80\x9d federal patent law.  See, e.g., Security-First Nat.

Jordan, 7 Wall. 583, 609; second, the \xe2\x80\x9coperation of the Declaratory Judgment Act\xe2\x80\x9d is only \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural,\xe2\x80\x9d Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227\n, leaving \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rights unchanged,\xe2\x80\x9d Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500\n; and third, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of proof\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantive\xe2\x80\x99 aspect of a claim,\xe2\x80\x9d Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15\n\xe2\x80\x9321.  Practical considerations lead to the same conclusion.  Shifting the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about a patent\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  It may also create unnecessary complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative.  Finally, burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the Declaratory Judgment Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of ameliorating the \xe2\x80\x9cdilemma\xe2\x80\x9d posed by \xe2\x80\x9cputting\xe2\x80\x9d one challenging a patent\xe2\x80\x99s scope \xe2\x80\x9cto the choice between abandoning his rights or risking\xe2\x80\x9d suit, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118\n.  To the extent that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s burden shifting rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous, that rule recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0Several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  First, Schaffer v. Weast,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n, which noted the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary default rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d have the \xe2\x80\x9crisk of failing to prove their claims,\xe2\x80\x9d does not support the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Schaffer was not a declaratory judgment case, and it described exceptions to its basic burden of proof rule.  For reasons explained in this case, declaratory judgment suits like this one are an exception to Schaffer\xe2\x80\x99s default rule.  Second, the fact that the Federal Circuit limited its holding to the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counterclaim by a patentee cannot, by itself, show that the holding is legally justified.  Third, contrary to one amicus\xe2\x80\x99 concern that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into full-blown infringement litigation, such litigation can occur only when there is a genuine and sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cimmedia[te]\xe2\x80\x9d dispute about a patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity or application, MedImmune, supra, at 127.  Here, Mirowski set this dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement, and there is no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor the patentee.  General considerations relating to the public interest in maintaining a well-functioning patent system are, at most, in balance, and do not favor changing the ordinary burden of proof rule.

Agawam Co. v. Jordan, 7 Wall. 583, 609 (1869).  This case asks us to decide whether the burden of proof shifts when the patentee is a defendant in a declaratory judgment action, and the plaintiff (the potential infringer) seeks a judgment that he does not infringe the patent.  We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee to establish that there is no infringement, the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee.  We reverse the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We set forth a simplified version of the facts.  The parties are Medtronic, Inc., a firm that (among other things) designs, makes, and sells medical devices, and Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, a firm that owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators.  In 1991 Medtronic and Mirowski entered into an agreement permitting Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In less simplified form: Mirowski entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which then sublicensed the Mirowski patents to Medtronic. Guidant Corp. is Eli Lilly\xe2\x80\x99s successor in interest.  For present purposes we shall ignore Eli Lilly, Guidant, and other parties on Mirowski\xe2\x80\x99s side, using \xe2\x80\x9cMirowski\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to any and all of them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The 1991 agreement also provided that, if Mirowski gave notice to Medtronic that a new Medtronic product \xe2\x80\x9cinfringe[d]\xe2\x80\x9d a Mirowski patent, Medtronic had a choice.  App. 13.  Medtronic could simply \xe2\x80\x9ccure the nonpayment of royalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Or it could pay royalties and, at the same time, \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cassertion of infringement of any of the Mirowski patents through a Declaratory Judgment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Medtronic, of course, might just ignore the agreement and decide not to pay royalties at all, in which case Mirowski would have \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to terminate the [l]icense,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and, if it wished, bring an infringement action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2006 the parties entered into a further agreement that slightly modified the procedure for resolving disputes.  If Medtronic, having received \xe2\x80\x9ctimely written notice of infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d chose to pursue a declaratory judgment action \xe2\x80\x9cchallenging infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d it could \xe2\x80\x9caccumulate disputed royalties\xe2\x80\x9d in an escrow account.  Id., at 24, 27.  The prevailing party in the declaratory judgment action would receive the royalties.  Id., at 28.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2007 the parties found themselves in the midst of an \xe2\x80\x9cinfringement\xe2\x80\x9d dispute.  Mirowski gave Medtronic notice that it believed seven new Medtronic products violated various claims contained in two of its patents (related to devices that cause the heart\xe2\x80\x99s ventricles to contract simultaneously as the heart beats).  Medtronic thought that its products did not infringe Mirowski\xe2\x80\x99s patents, either because the products fell outside the scope of the patent claims or because the patents were invalid.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2007 Medtronic brought this declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court in Delaware.  It sought a declaration that its products did not infringe Mirowski\xe2\x80\x99s patents and that the patents were invalid.  But, as its agreement with Mirowski provided, Medtronic paid all the relevant royalties into an escrow account.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court recognized that Mirowski was the defendant in the action.  But it nonetheless believed that Mirowski, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s the part[y] asserting infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d bore the burden of proving infringement.  Medtronic, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., 777 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 750, 766 (Del. 2011); see Under Sea Industries, Inc. v. Dacor Corp., 833 F.\xc2\xa02d 1551, 1557 (CA Fed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe burden always is on the patentee to show infringement\xe2\x80\x9d).  After a bench trial, the court found that Mirowski had not proved infringement, either directly or under the doctrine of equivalents.  And since Mirowski, the patentee, bore the burden of proof, it lost.  777 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 767\xe2\x80\x93770.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered the burden of proof question, and it came to the opposite conclusion.  It held that Medtronic, the declaratory judgment plaintiff, bore the burden.  It acknowledged that normally the patentee, not the accused infringer, bears the burden of proving infringement, and that the burden normally will not \xe2\x80\x9cshift\xe2\x80\x9d even when the patentee is \xe2\x80\x9ca counterclaiming defendant in a declaratory judgment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  695 F.\xc2\xa03d 1266, 1272 (2012).  Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals believed that a different rule applies where that patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant and, like Mirowski, that patentee/defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cforeclosed\xe2\x80\x9d from asserting an \xe2\x80\x9cinfringement counterclaim\xe2\x80\x9d by the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued existence of a license.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1274.  In that case, the Court of Appeals held, the party \xe2\x80\x9cseeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement,\xe2\x80\x9d namely Medtronic, \xe2\x80\x9cbears the burden of persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Medtronic sought certiorari, asking us to review the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof rule.  In light of the importance of burdens of proof in patent litigation, we granted the petition.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We begin with a jurisdictional matter.  An amicus claims that we must vacate the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision because that court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  Amicus agrees with the parties that\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71338(a) gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  Moreover, the version of \xc2\xa71295(a)(1) governing this appeal gives the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate jurisdiction over any case where jurisdiction in the district court \xe2\x80\x9cwas based, in whole or in part, on section 1338.\xe2\x80\x9d  But, amicus says, in determining whether this case is a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action arising under\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cAct of Congress relating to patents,\xe2\x80\x9d we must look to the nature of the action that the declaratory judgment defendant, namely the patentee, Mirowski, could have brought in the absence of a declaratory judgment.  And that action, amicus adds (in its most significant argument against jurisdiction), would not be a patent infringement action but, rather, an action for damages for breach of contract, namely an action for breach of the Mirowski-Medtronic licensing contract, in which patent infringement is the central issue.  See Brief for Tessera Technologies, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We agree with amicus that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of the federal courts.  Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,\n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 667,\n671 (1950)\n.  We also agree that federal courts, when determining declaratory judgment jurisdiction, often look to the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter of the threatened action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Utah v. Wycoff Co.,\n\n344 U.\xc2\xa0S. 237,\n248 (1952)\n.  That is to say, they ask whether \xe2\x80\x9ca coercive action\xe2\x80\x9d brought by \xe2\x80\x9cthe declaratory judgment defendant\xe2\x80\x9d (here Mirowski) \xe2\x80\x9cwould necessarily present a federal question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n19 (1983)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But we do not agree with amicus\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive\xe2\x80\x9d action that Mirowski might have brought.  The patent licensing agreement specifies that, if Medtronic stops paying royalties, Mirowski can terminate the contract and bring an ordinary patent infringement action.  Such an action would arise under federal patent law because \xe2\x80\x9cfederal patent law creates the cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp.,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800,\n809 (1988)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Amicus says that an infringement suit would be un-likely.  But that is not the relevant question.  The relevant question concerns the nature of the threatened action in the absence of the declaratory judgment suit.  Medtronic believes\xe2\x80\x94and seeks to establish in this declaratory judgment suit\xe2\x80\x94that it does not owe royalties because its products are noninfringing.  If Medtronic were to act on that belief (by not paying royalties and not bringing a declaratory judgment action), Mirowski could terminate the license and bring an ordinary federal patent law action for infringement.  See Brief for Respondent 48 (acknowledging that if Medtronic had \xe2\x80\x9cchosen not to pay the royalties .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. it would have subjected itself to a suit for infringement\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consequently this declaratory judgment action, which avoids that threatened action, also \xe2\x80\x9carises under\xe2\x80\x9d federal patent law.  See Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 19; Wycoff Co., supra, at 248.  See also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118,\n128 (2007)\n (concluding that Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement was satis-fied where a patent licensee faced the threat of suit if it ceased making payments under a license agreement, notwithstanding that the licensee\xe2\x80\x99s continued royalty payments rendered the prospect of such a suit \xe2\x80\x9cremote, if not nonexistent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For this reason we believe that the hypothetical threatened action is properly characterized as an action \xe2\x80\x9carising under an Act of Congress relating to patents.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71338(a).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We now turn to the question presented.  A patent li-censee paying royalties into an escrow account under a pat-ent licensing agreement seeks a declaratory judgment that some of its products are not covered by or do not infringe the patent, and that it therefore does not owe royalties for those products.  In that suit, who bears the burden of proof, or, to be more precise, the burden of persuasion?  Must the patentee prove infringement or must the licensee prove noninfringement?  In our view, the burden of persuasion is with the patentee, just as it would be had the patentee brought an infringement suit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Simple legal logic, resting upon settled case law, strongly supports our conclusion.  It is well established that the burden of proving infringement generally rests upon the patentee.  See, e.g., Imhaeuser v. Buerk,\n\n101 U.\xc2\xa0S. 647,\n662 (1880)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he burden to prove infringement never shifts [to the alleged infringer] if the charge is denied in the plea or answer\xe2\x80\x9d); Agawam Co., 7 Wall., at 609 (\xe2\x80\x9cInfringement is an affirmative allegation made by the complainant, and the burden of proving it is upon him .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).

Illinois Dept. of Revenue,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15\n\xe2\x80\x9321 (2000); Director, Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs v.

[is] part of the very substance of [the plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s] claim and cannot be considered a mere incident of a form of procedure\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Taken together these three legal propositions indicate that, in a licensee\xe2\x80\x99s declaratory judgment action, the burden of proving infringement should remain with the patentee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Several practical considerations lead to the same conclusion.  To shift the burden depending upon the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about the scope of the patent.  Suppose the evidence is inconclusive, and an alleged infringer loses his declaratory judgment action because he failed to prove noninfringement.  The alleged infringer, or others, might continue to engage in the same allegedly infringing behavior, leaving it to the patentee to bring an infringement action.  If the burden shifts, the patentee might lose that action because, the evidence being inconclusive, he failed to prove infringement.  So, both sides might lose as to infringement, leaving the infringement question undecided, creating uncertainty among the parties and others who seek to know just what products and processes they are free to use.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The example is not fanciful.  The Restatement (Second) of Judgments says that relitigation of an issue (say, infringement) decided in one suit \xe2\x80\x9cis not precluded\xe2\x80\x9d in a subsequent suit where the burden of persuasion \xe2\x80\x9chas shifted\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9cparty against whom preclusion is sought .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to his adversary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa728(4) (1980).  Rather, the</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]ailure of one party to carry the burden of persuasion on an issue should not establish the issue in favor of an adversary who otherwise would have the burden of persuasion on that issue in later litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74422, p. 592 (2d ed. 2002).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus the declaratory judgment suit in the example above would have failed to achieve its object: to provide \xe2\x80\x9can immediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Aetna, supra, at 241.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, to shift the burden can, at least on occasion, create unnecessary complexity by making it difficult for the licensee to understand upon just what theory the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim rests.  A complex patent can contain many pages of claims and limitations.  A patent holder is in a better position than an alleged infringer to know, and to be able to point out, just where, how, and why a product (or process) infringes a claim of that patent.  Until he does so, however, the alleged infringer may have to work in the dark, seeking, in his declaratory judg-ment complaint, to negate every conceivable infringement theory.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally burden shifting here is difficult to reconcile with a basic purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.  In MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., a case that similarly concerned a patent licensee that brought a declaratory judgment action after the patentee accused it of infringement, we wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98very purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of that Act is to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ameliorate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cdilemma\xe2\x80\x9d posed by \xe2\x80\x9cputting\xe2\x80\x9d one who challenges a patent\xe2\x80\x99s scope \xe2\x80\x9cto the choice between abandoning his rights or risking\xe2\x80\x9d suit.  549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 129 (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136,\n152 (1967)\n).  In the absence of the declaratory judgment procedure, Medtronic would face the precise dilemma that MedImmune describes.  Either Medtronic would have to abandon its right to challenge the scope of Mirowski\xe2\x80\x99s patents, or it would have to stop paying royalties, risk losing an ordinary patent infringement lawsuit, and thereby risk liability for treble damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees as well as injunctive relief.  See 35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7283\xe2\x80\x93285 (providing for injunctive relief, treble damages, and\xe2\x80\x94in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees as remedies for patent infringement).  As in MedImmune, the declaratory judgment action rescues Medtronic from this dilemma.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s burden shifting rule does not deprive Medtronic of the right to seek a declaratory judgment.  But it does create a significant obstacle to use of that action.  It makes the declaratory judgment procedure\xe2\x80\x94compared to, say, just refusing to pay royalties\xe2\x80\x94dis-advantageous.  To that extent it recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid.  As we have made clear (and as we explain below), we are un-aware of any strong reason for creating that obstacle.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the contrary.  First, the Federal Circuit thought it had found support in a recent case of this Court, Schaffer v. Weast,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49 (2005)\n.  In that case we referred to the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary default rule\xe2\x80\x9d as placing upon the \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9crisk of failing to prove their claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 56.  We added that that is because the plaintiffs are normally the parties \xe2\x80\x9cseeking relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 58.  And Medtronic, not Mirowski, is the declaratory judgment \xe2\x80\x9cplaintif\xc2\xa0[f\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Schaffer, however, was not a declaratory judgment case.  And Schaffer described exceptions to its basic burden of proof rule.  E.g., id., at 57 (when an element of a claim \xe2\x80\x9ccan fairly be characterized as [an] affirmative defens[e],\xe2\x80\x9d the burden of proof \xe2\x80\x9cmay be shifted to [the] defendants\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 60 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he ordinary rule, based on considerations of fairness, does not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting United States v. New York, N.\xc2\xa0H. &amp; H. R. Co.,\n\n355 U.\xc2\xa0S. 253\n, n.\xc2\xa05 (1957)).  For the reasons we have set forth in Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, supra, declaratory judgment suits like the one at issue here constitute a further exception to the basic rule Schaffer described.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, the Federal Circuit emphasized that its holding applied only in \xe2\x80\x9cthe limited circumstance when an infringement counterclaim by a patentee is foreclosed by the continued existence of a license.\xe2\x80\x9d  695 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1274.  The fact that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is limited, how-ever, does not support its conclusion.  The \xe2\x80\x9climited cir-cumstance\xe2\x80\x9d it described is often present when a patent licensee faces an ordinary but disputed claim of infringement.  And that \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance\xe2\x80\x9d is virtually identical to MedImmune, where we found a declaratory judgment action constitutionally permissible.  In any event, the fact that a rule\xe2\x80\x99s scope is limited cannot, by itself, show that the rule is legally justified.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, an amicus supporting Mirowski fears that our holding, unlike the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule, will \xe2\x80\x9cburden .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. patent owners\xe2\x80\x9d by permitting \xe2\x80\x9ca licensee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x94at its sole discretion\xe2\x80\x94[to] force the patentee into full-blown patent-infringement litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Intellectual Property Owners Association as Amicus Curiae 9.  The short answer to this argument, however, is that litigation can occur only in the presence of a genuine dispute, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of sufficient immediacy and reality,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d about the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity or its application.  MedImmune, supra, at 127 (quoting Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co.,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270,\n273 (1941)\n).  Indeed, it was Mirowski that set the present dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement.  And in such an instance, we see no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor the patentee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The public interest, of course, favors the maintenance of a well-functioning patent system.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d also has a \xe2\x80\x9cparamount interest in seeing that patent monopolies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are kept within their legitimate scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806,\n816 (1945)\n.  A patentee \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. allowed to exact royalties for the use of an idea .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that is beyond the scope of the patent monopoly granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation,\n\n402 U.\xc2\xa0S. 313\n\xe2\x80\x93350 (1971).  And \xe2\x80\x9c[l]icensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive\xe2\x80\x9d to litigate questions of a patent\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Lear, Inc. v. Adkins,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 653,\n670 (1969)\n.  The general public interest considerations are, at most, in balance.  They do not favor a change in the ordinary rule imposing the burden of proving infringement upon the patentee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For these reasons the judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
