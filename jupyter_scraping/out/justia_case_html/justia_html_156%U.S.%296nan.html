"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 156 U. S. 306</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>From early times in England and America, there have been statutes regulating the occupation of itinerant peddlers, and requiring them to obtain licenses to practice their trade.</p>\n<p>In Tomlin\'s Law Dictionary are these definitions:</p>\n<p>"<em>Hawkers.</em>  Those deceitful fellows who went from place to place, buying and selling brass, pewter, and other goods and merchandise, which ought to be uttered in open market, were of old so called, and the appellation seems to grow from their uncertain wandering, like persons that, with hawks, seek their game where they can find it.  They are mentioned in Stat. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 4. . . .  <em>Hawkers, Pedlars, and Petty Chapmen.</em>  Persons traveling from town to town with goods and merchandise.  These were under the control of commissioners for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 156 U. S. 307</a></p><p> licensing them for that purpose, under St. 8 &amp; 9 Wm. III. c. 25; 9 &amp; 10 Wm. III. c. 25 [9 Wm. III. c. 27]; 29 Geo. III. c. 26."</p>\n<p>The act of 50 Geo. III. c. 41, repealed the prior acts and imposed a penalty on</p>\n<p>"any hawker, pedlar, petty chapman, or any other trading person or persons, going from town to town, or to other men\'s houses, and traveling, either on foot, or with horse or horses,"</p>\n<p>and exposing to sale, or selling goods, wares, or merchandise by retail.  Upon an information in the Court of Exchequer to recover penalties under that act, Baron Graham said:</p>\n<p>"The object of the legislature in passing the act upon which this information is founded was to protect, on the one hand, fair traders, particularly established shopkeepers, resident permanently in towns or other places, and paying rent and taxes there for local privileges, from the mischiefs of being undersold by itinerant persons, to their injury, and, on the other, to guard the public from the impositions practiced by such persons in the course of their dealings, who, having no known or fixed residence, carry on a trade by means of vending goods conveyed from place to place by horse or cart."</p>\n<p><em>Attorney General v. Tongue</em> (1823), 12 Price 51, 60.</p>\n<p>In Massachusetts, both before and after the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, successive statutes imposed penalties on hawkers, peddlers, and petty chapmen.  7 Dane Ab. 72; St. 1713-14, c. 7 (1 Prov.Laws 720); 1716-17, c. 10; 1721-22, c. 61; 1726-27, c. 4 (2 Prov.Laws, 47, 232, 385); 1785, c. 2; 1799, c. 20; 1820, c. 45; Rev.Stat. 1836, c 35, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7, 8.  The statute of 1846, c. 244, repealing the earlier statutes, imposed a penalty on</p>\n<p>"every hawker, peddler or petty chapman or other person, going from town to town, or from place to place, or from dwellinghouse to dwellinghouse in the same town, either on foot, or with one or more horses, or otherwise carrying for sale, or exposing to sale, any goods, wares or merchandise"</p>\n<p>(with certain exceptions), without first obtaining a license as therein provided.</p>\n<p>In a case under that statute, Chief Justice Shaw said:</p>\n<p>"The leading, primary idea of a \'hawker and peddler\' is that of an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 156 U. S. 308</a></p><p> itinerant or traveling trader, who carries goods about in order to sell them and who actually sells them to purchasers, in contradistinction to a trader who has goods for sale and sells them in a fixed place of business.  Superadded to this, though perhaps not essential, by a \'hawker\' is generally understood one who not only carries goods for sale, but seeks for purchasers, either by outcry, which some lexicographers conceive as intimated by the derivation of the word, or by attracting notice and attention to them as goods for sale by an actual exhibition or exposure of them, by placards or labels, or by a conventional signal, like the sound of a horn for the sale of fish.  But our statute goes further, and not only proscribes actual hawkers and peddlers, whose employment is that of traveling traders, and thus seems to refer to a business or habitual occupation, but it extends to all persons doing the acts proscribed."</p>\n<p><em>Commonwealth v. Ober</em> (1853), 12 Cush. 493, 495.</p>\n<p>In that case, it was objected that the statute was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States because at variance with the exclusive right of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes, to which Chief Justice Shaw answered:</p>\n<p>"The law in question interferes with none of these. . . .  We consider this as wholly an internal commerce, which the states have a right to regulate, and in this respect this law stands on the same footing with the laws regulating sales of wine and spirits, sales at auction, and very many others which are in force and constantly acted upon."</p>\n<p>12 Cush. 497.</p>\n<p>In Michigan, a city ordinance, passed under authority of the legislature, prohibiting peddling without a license from the mayor was held constitutional, and Chief Justice Cooley said:</p>\n<p>"That the regulation of hawkers and peddlers is important, if not absolutely essential, may be taken as established by the concurring practice of civilized states.  They are a class of persons who travel from place to place among strangers, and the business may easily be made a pretense or a convenience to those whose real purpose is theft or fraud.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 156 U. S. 309</a></p><p> requirement of a license gives opportunity for inquiry into antecedents and character, and the payment of a fee affords some evidence that the business is not a mere pretense."</p>\n<p><em>People v. Russell</em> (1883), 49 Mich. 617, 619.</p>\n<p>In the courts of many other states, statutes imposing a penalty for peddling without a license all goods of particular kinds, and not discriminating against goods brought from other states or from foreign countries, have been held not to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.  <em>Cowles v. Brittain</em> (1822), 2 Hawks 204; <em>Wynne v. Wright</em> (1834), 1 Dev. &amp; Bat. 19; <em>Tracy v. State</em> (1829), 3 Mo. 3; <em>Morrill v. State</em> (1875), 38 Wis. 428; <em>Howe Machine Co. v. Cage</em> (1876), 9 Baxt. 518; <em>Graffty v. Rushville</em> (1886), 107 Ind. 502; <em>State v. Richards</em> (1889), 32 W.Va. 348; <em>Commonwealth v. Gardner</em> (1890), 133 Penn.St. 284.</p>\n<p>The statute of Missouri under which the conviction in the case at bar was had is contained in a separate chapter of the Revised Statutes of the state, entitled "Peddlers and Their Licenses," and relating to no other subject.  By this statute, "Whoever shall deal in the selling of" any goods, wares, or merchandise (except books, charts, maps, and stationery) "by going from place to place to sell the same, is declared to be a peddler," and is prohibited from dealing as a peddler without a license.  Rev.Stat. of 1879, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6471, 6472.  The license is required to state how the dealing is to be carried on -- whether on foot or with one or more beasts of burden, a cart or wagon, or a boat or vessel -- and may be obtained by any person paying the tax prescribed, according to the manner in which the business is carried on.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6473, 6476, 6477.  Any person dealing as a peddler, without a license, whether with a pack, a wagon, or a boat, is to pay a certain penalty, which, in the case of peddling in a cart or wagon, is fifty dollars.  \xc2\xa7 6478.  And any peddler who refuses to exhibit his license on demand of a sheriff, collector, constable, or citizen householder of the county is to forfeit the sum of ten dollars.  \xc2\xa7 6479.</p>\n<p>The facts were agreed that the Singer Manufacturing Company, for more than five years last past, and on the day in question, was a corporation of New Jersey; that the defendant, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 156 U. S. 310</a></p><p> on and prior to that day, was in the employment of that company, and on that day, in pursuance of that employment, and having no peddler\'s license, was engaged in going from place to place in Montgomery County, in the State of Missouri, with a horse and wagon, soliciting orders for the sale of the company\'s sewing machines, and having with him in the wagon one of those machines, the property of the company, and manufactured by it at its works in New Jersey, and which it had forwarded and delivered to him for sale on its account, and that he offered this machine for sale to various persons at different places, and found a purchaser, and sold and delivered it to him.</p>\n<p>The supreme court of the state, in its opinion, understood and assumed the effect of those facts to be as follows:</p>\n<p>"The defendant was engaged in going from place to place, selling and trying to sell sewing machines in Montgomery County, in this state, and had been so engaged for some years.  He carried the machines with him in a wagon, and, on making a sale, delivered those sold to the purchaser.  He was not only soliciting orders, but was making sales and delivering the property sold.  These acts bring him clearly within the statutory definition of a \'peddler,\' and, having no license from the state, he became liable to the penalties imposed by the statute unless, for any reason, he was exempt from the operations of the law."</p>\n<p>103 Mo. 247.  It is argued by one of his counsel that this was an unwarranted conclusion from the facts agreed.  But the construction of those facts does not present a federal question except so far as it involves the constitutionality of the statute.  Upon any construction, it is clear that the defendant was engaged in going from place to place within the state, without a license, soliciting orders for the sale of sewing machines, having with him in the wagon at least one of those machines, and offering that machine for sale to various persons at different places, and that he finally sold it, and delivered it to the purchaser.  The conclusion that such dealing made him a peddler within the meaning of the statute of the state and of the information on which he was convicted presents, of itself, no constitutional question. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 156 U. S. 311</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The facts appear to have been agreed for the purpose of presenting the question whether the statute was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.  This was the only question discussed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri.  And it is the only one of which this Court has jurisdiction upon this writ of error.</p>\n<p>The defendant\'s occupation was offering for sale and selling sewing machines by going from place to place in the State of Missouri in a wagon, without a license.  There is nothing in the case to show that he ever offered for sale any machine that he did not have with him at the time.  His dealings were neither accompanied nor followed by any transfer of goods, or of any order for their transfer, from one state to another, and were neither interstate commerce in themselves nor were they in any way directly connected with such commerce.  The only business or commerce in which he was engaged was internal and domestic, and, so far as appears, the only goods in which he was dealing had become part of the mass of property within the state.  Both the occupation and the goods, therefore, were subject to the taxing power and to the police power of the state.</p>\n<p>The statute in question is not part of a revenue law.  It makes no discrimination between residents or products of Missouri and those of other states, and manifests no intention to interfere in any way with interstate commerce.  Its object in requiring peddlers to take out and pay for licenses, and to exhibit their licenses, on demand, to any peace officer or to any citizen householder of the county, appears to have been to protect the citizens of the state against the cheats and frauds, or even thefts, which, as the experience of ages has shown, are likely to attend itinerant and irresponsible peddling from place to place and from door to door.</p>\n<p>If this question were now brought before this Court for the first time, there could hardly be a doubt of the validity of the statute.  But it is not a new question in this Court.</p>\n<p>The decision at October term, 1879, in the case reported as <em>Machine Co. v. Gage,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/676/case.html">100 U. S. 676</a></span>, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>Howe Machine Co. v. Cage,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 156 U. S. 312</a></p><p> 9 Baxt. 518, is directly in point.  The facts agreed, upon which that case was submitted, as shown by the record, were as follows:  the Howe Machine Company, a corporation of Connecticut, manufactured sewing machines at Bridgeport, in that state, and had an office at Nashville, in the State of Tennessee, and sent an agent into Sumner County for the purpose of selling or peddling machines, who traveled through the country in a wagon, with one horse, for the purpose of exhibiting and offering for sale the company\'s machines.  That the machines offered for sale and sold by him were manufactured in Connecticut, and brought into Tennessee for sale, and that he paid, under protest, a tax required of him under the statutes of Tennessee for the privilege or license to peddle or sell the machines of the company in Sumner County.  By those statutes, "all articles manufactured of the produce of the state" were exempt from taxation, and "all peddlers of sewing machines" were required to pay a tax of fifteen dollars.  The Supreme Court of Tennessee having held that the latter provision "levied a tax upon all peddlers of sewing machines, without regard to the place of growth or produce of material, or of manufacture," this Court, speaking by Mr. Justice Swayne, considered itself "bound to regard this construction as correct, and to give it the same effect as if it were a part of the statute," and decided that</p>\n<p>"the statute in question, as construed by the supreme court of the state, makes no such discrimination.  It applies alike to sewing machines manufactured in the state, and out of it.  The exaction is not an unusual or unreasonable one.  The state, putting all such machines upon the same footing with respect to the tax complained of, had an unquestionable right to impose the burden."</p>\n<p>100 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/676/case.html#677">100 U.

S. 679</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It has been strenuously argued that that decision is inconsistent with earlier and later decisions of this Court upon the subject of the powers of the several states as affected by the grant by the Constitution to Congress of the power to regulate commerce.  It becomes necessary therefore to examine those decisions with care, beginning with the earlier ones.</p>\n<p>In the leading case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/419/case.html">Brown v. Maryland</a></span></em> (1827), 12 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 156 U. S. 313</a></p><p> Wheat. 419, in which it was adjudged that a statute of Maryland requiring, under a penalty, importers or other persons selling foreign goods by the bale or package to take out and pay for a license, was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States both as laying an impost or duty on imports without the consent of Congress and as inconsistent with the power of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations, Mr. Taney and Mr. Johnson, for the State of Maryland, argued that the tax was "laid upon the same principle with the usual taxes on retailers or innkeepers, or hawkers and pedlars, or upon any other trade exercised within the state."  12 Wheat. 425 [argument of counsel -- omitted].</p>\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall, in answering that argument, said:</p>\n<p>"This indictment is against the importer for selling a package of dry goods, in the form in which it was imported, without a license.  This state of things is changed if he sells them or otherwise mixes them with the general property of the state by breaking up his packages and traveling with them as an itinerant peddler.  In the first case, the tax intercepts the import as an import in its way to become incorporate with the general mass of property, and denies it the privilege of becoming so incorporated until it shall have contributed to the revenue of the state.  It denies to the importer the right of using the privilege which he has purchased from the United States until he shall also have purchased it from the state.  In the last cases, the tax finds the article already incorporated with the mass of property by the act of the importer.  He has used the privilege he had purchased, and has himself mixed them up with the common mass, and the law may treat them as it finds them.  The same observations apply to plate or other furniture used by the importer.  So if he sells by auction.  Auctioneers are persons licensed by the state, and if the importer chooses to employ them, he can as little object to paying for this service as for any other for which he may apply to an officer of the state.  The right of sale may very well be annexed to importation without annexing to it also the privilege of using the officers licensed by the state to make sales in a peculiar way."</p>\n<p>12 Wheat.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/419/case.html#443">25 U.

There is no attempt to discriminate injuriously against the products of other states or the rights of their citizens, and the case is not therefore an attempt to fetter commerce among the states, or to deprive the citizens of other states of any privilege or immunity possessed by citizens of Alabama.

As the effect of the act is such as we have described, and it institutes no legislation which discriminates against the products of sister states, but merely subjects them to the same rate of taxation which similar articles pay that are manufactured within the state, we do not see in it an attempt to regulate commerce, but an appropriate and legitimate exercise of the taxing power of the states."</p>\n<p>8 Wall.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/153/case.html">75 U.

Yet this Court unanimously decided that a tax imposed by general statutes of the State of Louisiana upon this coal was valid, and, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, said:</p>\n<p>"It was not a tax imposed upon the coal as a foreign product, or as the product of another state than Louisiana, nor a tax imposed by reason of the coal\'s being imported or brought into Louisiana, nor a tax imposed whilst it was in a state of transit through that state to some other place of destination.  It was imposed after the coal had arrived at its destination and was put up for sale.  The coal had come to its place of rest for final disposal or use, and was a commodity in the market of New Orleans. . . .  The taxing of goods coming from other states, as such, or by reason of their so coming, would be a discriminating tax against them as imports, and would be a regulation of interstate commerce inconsistent with that perfect freedom of trade which Congress has seen fit should remain undisturbed.  But if, after their arrival within the state -- that being their place of destination for use or trade -- if, after this, they are subjected to a general tax, laid alike on all property within the city, we fail to see how such a taxing can be deemed a regulation of commerce which would have the objectionable effect referred to."</p>\n<p>114 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/622/case.html#632">114 U.

But to tax the sale of such goods, or the offer to sell them, before they are brought into the state, is a very different thing, and seems to us clearly a tax on interstate commerce itself. . . .

And in the dissenting opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Waite, in which two other justices concurred, it was assumed, as incontrovertible, that another provision of the same statute, requiring a license fee from all peddlers within the district, could not be held unconstitutional in its application to peddlers who came with their goods from another state, and expected to go back again.  120 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/120/489/case.html#501">120 U.
