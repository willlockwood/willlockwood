Chouteau and others, devisees of Auguste Chouteau, presented their petition to the Court of the United States for the District of Missouri, praying that their title to one thousand two hundred and eighty-one arpents of land near the Town of St. Louis in the State of Missouri, which they claim under the following circumstances, be confirmed.</p>\n<p>The late Auguste Chouteau applied to the then existing governor of Upper Louisiana for permission to establish a distillery in or near the Town of St. Louis, which permission was granted on 3 January, 1800.</p>\n<p>He then petitioned for a concession for one thousand two hundred and eighty-one superficial arpents of land, to furnish firewood for his distillery; which was granted in the following words:</p>\n<p>"St. Louis of Illinois, January 5, 1800"</p>\n<p>"Being satisfied that the applicant has sufficient means to make available in the term of the regulation of this province </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 34 U.

I am in such a hurry that I have but the time to tell you that I am your sincere friend and most humble servant,"</p>\n<p>"MANUEL GAYOSO DE LEMOS"</p>\n<p>The order of survey was executed on 10 April, 1801, and the petitioner put into possession, which he retained till his death, having first made his last will, in which he devised it to the petitioners, who have taken all the steps required by law, to preserve their claim.</p>\n<p>The petition prays for a confirmation of the title.  The answer of the district attorney admits nothing, and submits the case to the court on the proof to be made by the petitioners.  The erection of the distillery, and the manufacture of spirits to a considerable extent, the apparent motives to the grant, are fully proved.</p>\n<p>The distinction between the case of Chouteau and others and that of Delassus, whose title has been confirmed, consists in this.  The concession to Delassus was made by the lieutenant governor of Upper Louisiana by direction of the governor general, at a time when the power of granting land was vested in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 34 U. S. 144</a></p><p> the governors of provinces.  This power was transferred to the intendant general in 1799, after which transfer in 1800, the order of survey under which Chouteau claimed, was made by the lieutenant governor.  The validity of the order depends on the authority of the lieutenant governor to make it.  Chouteau alleges in support of this authority, that the lieutenant governor was also subdelegate, in which character he was empowered to grant incomplete titles.</p>\n<p>Several documents have been laid before the Court which satisfy us that the lieutenant governors were, by virtue of their office, subdelegates.  In the record in Soulard\'s case, which we understand is to be considered as an exhibit in this, a letter from the Lieutenant Governor Delassus to the surveyor general is introduced, in which he recites a letter of Morales, the intendant general, to him dated 1 December, 1802, informing him that in consequence of the death of the assessor, he had closed the tribunal of affairs and causes relating to grants and confirmations of royal lands.  The letter adds:</p>\n<p>"I make this communication in order that, apprised of this providence, you may not receive, frame, or transmit memorials soliciting lands until further orders."</p>\n<p>In a letter of 26 August, 1799, addressed by Morales to Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, in which he notices instructions given by Delassus to Roberto McKay, in his character of subdelegate, he observes,</p>\n<p>"I must say, that it being contrary to law that one subdelegate should transfer his powers to another, the instruction given by you cannot, nor ought to have effect, and the more so, as the subdelegation of the intendancy is local."</p>\n<p>In a certificate given by Don Gilberto Leonard, Treasurer of the Army, and Don Manuel Gonzalez Armirez, Ministers of the Royal Treasury, &amp;c., of the Province of Louisiana, they certify that in pursuance of a decree of the senior intendant general <em>ad interim,</em> the Senior Colonel Charles Dehault Delassus, formerly commandant of the port of New Madrid, and Lieutenant Governor of St. Louis of the Illinois, with the subdelegation of the royal treasury in both situations, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>In the claims laid before the commissioners and confirmed are several which originated with Delassus after the power of granting lands was transferred from the governor to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 34 U. S. 145</a></p><p> intendant general.  This very order of survey was executed by the surveyor general in 1801.  Possession was delivered to Chouteau which was retained by him during his life, and appears to have remained with his devisees since his death.</p>\n<p>On this point the report made by the recorder and commissioners to Congress under the Act of 9 July, 1832, and 2 March, 1833, cannot be disregarded.  They speak of the union of the two offices of lieutenant governor and subdelegate as being universally understood and admitted.</p>\n<p>Charles Dehault Delassus, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana, whose deposition appears to be annexed to the report of the commissioners, deposes</p>\n<p>"that all the lieutenant governors of Upper Louisiana were, in virtue of their offices as lieutenant governors, likewise subdelegates.  That the offices of lieutenant governor and subdelegate were inseparable."</p>\n<p>Morales, immediately after the sale of the royal lands had been transferred to his intendancy, assigns as one reason for issuing his regulations, "that the commandants, as subdelegates of the intendancy, may be informed of what they ought to observe."</p>\n<p>If, as we think must be admitted, Delassus was subdelegate as well as lieutenant governor, the transfer of the power of granting lands belonging to the royal domain from the governor to the intendant general, did not affect his power to give the order of survey on which the title of the petitioners depends.  That order is the foundation of title, and is, according to the acts of Congress and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title.  It is property capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts, and is as such to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property.</p>\n<p>The power of Lieutenant Governor Delassus in his character of subdelegate to make this order of survey being established, all the principles settled in the preceding cases apply to this.  No objection to the claim is perceived, and we think it ought to have been declared valid.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the district court is reversed and annulled, and this Court, proceeding to give such decree as the district court ought to have given, doth declare the claim of the petitioners to the tract of land in their petition mentioned to be valid, and both confirm their title to the same according to the boundaries </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 34 U.
