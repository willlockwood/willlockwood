No federal question arose in the trial court or in the Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut which was decided against the title, right, privilege, or immunity set up or claimed by the plaintiff in error."</p>\n<p>"3.

The Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut, the court of last resort in that state, in construing a local statute, the one here in question, has ruled that the law is an amendment of the charter of the plaintiff company, which charter is amendable at the will of the General Assembly of that state."</p>\n<p>"5.

If there is a federal question involveed in the judgment, the decision of the court below is so clearly right that the writ of error should be dismissed or the decree and judgment affirmed."</p>\n<p>"9. This suit is an application, or written motion, addressed to the Superior Court for New Haven County in the name of the state by the state\'s attorney for that county for an alternative mandamus.  Upon the application, the alternative writ was not issued, but a rule to show cause against the defendants was made, and upon that hearing, the defendants moved to quash the application for manifold reasons set forth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 153 U. S. 691</a></p><p> in the record.  The motion to quash was granted, and the applicant appealed from the judgment to the Supreme Court of Errors.  That court dismissed the appeal upon the grounds that the commission was a body whose power was plenary, and that the duties to be performed were such as in the highest degree call for the exercise of judgment and discretion, and that the superior court had no power by mandamus to control the acts of the commission; that the commission had acted on the damages, and that their action was just and wise.  From the denial to issue even an alternative writ the relators appealed.  If this appeal brings any federal question in any way before this Court, it is precisely the same one recently disposed of upon the motion to dismiss the writ of error brought by these same parties against the Railroad Commissioners in the <em>Town of Bristol Case,</em> opinion announced February 5, 1894.  <em>New York &amp; New England Railroad v. Bristol,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/151/556/case.html">151 U. S. 556</a></span>.  This writ of error attempts to raise a constitutional question, which is not included in the decision of the state courts, but which, in another action, was adjudged against them on precisely the same statute and between precisely the same parties, and when a writ of error from that judgment was dismissed by this Court at their motion."</p>\n<p>"10.
