S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  Respondent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, petitioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its federal contracts.  To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552.  Granting Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded, <em>inter alia,</em> that the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdiction over Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s allegations that were based on information disclosed in a Government \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s response to a FOIA request is neither a \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d nor an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s written response to a FOIA request for records constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gross</em> v. <em>FBL Financial Services, Inc.</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___.  Dictionaries define \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d as, for example, something that gives information.  This ordinary meaning is consistent with the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s generally broad scope, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the other sources of public disclosure in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A), especially \xe2\x80\x9cnews media.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of \xe2\x80\x9creport.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Second Circuit committed the very error this Court reversed in <em>Graham County.  </em>In applying the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d was mandated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclosure listed in the statute\xe2\x80\x94in particular, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnews media.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 559 U. S., at ___.  Applying the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d also does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s three written FOIA responses in this case, along with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are \xe2\x80\x9creports\xe2\x80\x9d within the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning.  FOIA requires each agency receiving a request to \xe2\x80\x9cnotify the person making such request of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(a)(6)(A)(i).  Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted FOIA regulations mandating a written response.  Such agency responses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d as, <em>e.g.,</em> something that gives information.  Moreover, any records produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history.  If anything, the drafting history supports this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s case seems a classic example of the \xe2\x80\x9copportunistic\xe2\x80\x9d litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___.  Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially reap a windfall in a <em>qui tam </em>action under the FCA.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.  Kirk argues that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling would allow a suit by a <em>qui tam</em> relator possessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents by way of a FOIA request.  Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unrequested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the Court is not troubled by the different treatment.  By its plain terms, the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others.  See <em>Graham County,</em> 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar\xe2\x80\x99s scope and some did not.  Moreover, Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA request for incriminating documents is pure speculation.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at ___.  There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA responses are \xe2\x80\x9creports\xe2\x80\x9d within the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted, Kirk and his <em>amici</em> have provided no principled way to define \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s annual report of FOIA statistics\xe2\x80\x94that are indisputably reports.  Pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Whether Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s suit is \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon \xe2\x80\xa6 allegations or transactions\xe2\x80\x9d disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on remand.

That Act requires contractors like Schindler to report certain information to the Secretary of Labor, including how many of its employees are \xe2\x80\x9cqualified covered veterans\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74212(d)(1).  VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to agree in each of its contracts that it would \xe2\x80\x9csubmit VETS\xe2\x80\x93100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 CFR \xc2\xa752.222\xe2\x80\x9337(c) (2008); see also \xc2\xa722.1310(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran who served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and Schindler from 1978 until 2003.  In August 2003, Kirk resigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to force him out.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler under the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties and treble damages on persons who submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States.  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73729(a).  The FCA authorizes both civil actions by the Attorney General and private <em>qui tam </em>actions to enforce its provisions.  \xc2\xa73730.  When, as here, the Government chooses not to intervene in a <em>qui tam </em>action, the private relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of the proceeds of the action.  \xc2\xa73730(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk alleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its Government contracts.  According to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA\xe2\x80\x99s reporting requirements by failing to file certain required VETS\xe2\x80\x93100 reports and including false information in those it did file.  The company\xe2\x80\x99s claims for payment were false, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified its compliance with VEVRAA.  Kirk did not specify the amount of damages he sought on behalf of the United States, but he asserted that the value of Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s VEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information his wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of Labor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests.  Mrs. Kirk had sought all VETS\xe2\x80\x93100 reports filed by Schindler for the years 1998 through 2006.  The DOL responded by letter or e-mail to each request with information about the records found for each year, including years for which no responsive records were located.  The DOL informed Mrs. Kirk that it found no VETS\xe2\x80\x93100 reports filed by Schindler in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003.  For the other years, the DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports filed by Schindler, 99 in all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds, including that the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.  See \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  The District Court granted the motion, concluding that most of Kirk\xe2\x80\x99s allegations failed to state a claim and that the remainder were based upon the public disclosure of alle-gations or transactions in an administrative \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  606 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 448 (SDNY 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated and remanded.<em> </em>601 F.\xc2\xa03d 94 (2010).

Like the Fourth Circuit in that case, the Second Circuit here applied the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the exclusion of the rest of the statute.  See 601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 107, n.\xc2\xa06.  We emphasized in <em>Graham County </em>that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> of the sources [of public disclosure] listed in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>559 U.

When all of the sources are considered, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which the Court of Appeals did not consider\xe2\x80\x94suggests a much broader scope.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government similarly errs by focusing only on \nthe adjectives \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO],\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] which precede \xe2\x80\x9creport.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18.  It contends that these adjectives suggest that the public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports \xe2\x80\x9canalogous to those that Congress and the GAO would issue or conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As we explained in <em>Graham County</em>, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing more than that a \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d must be governmental.  See 559 U. S.<em>,</em> at ___, n.\xc2\xa07 (slip op., at 7, n.\xc2\xa07).  The governmental nature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  Kirk argues that reading \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9csomething that gives information\xe2\x80\x9d would subsume the other words in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9creport, hearing, audit, or investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 23.  But Kirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are processes \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>obtain</em> information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Those processes are thus clearly different from \xe2\x80\x9csomething that <em>gives</em> information.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, the statute contemplates some redundancy: An \xe2\x80\x9caudit,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, will often be a type of \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded that we should adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent, somewhat special meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d over the word\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Muscarello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/125/index.html">524 U. S. 125</a>, 130, 128 (1998).  Indeed, we have cautioned recently against interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way inconsistent with a plain reading of its text.  In <em>Graham County</em>, we rejected several arguments for construing the statute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole \xe2\x80\x9ctouchstone\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory text is \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U.

We chose in that case simply to give the text its \xe2\x80\x9cmost natura[l] read[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A written agency response to a FOIA request falls within the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9creport.\xe2\x80\x9d  FOIA requires each agency receiving a request to \xe2\x80\x9cnotify the person making such request of [its] determination and the \nreasons therefor.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(a)(6)(A)(i).  When an agency denies a request in whole or in part, it must additionally \xe2\x80\x9cset forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmake a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprovide any such estimate to the person making the request.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F).  The DOL has adopted more detailed regulations implementing FOIA and mandating a response in writing.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa770.21(a) (2009) (requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request and a description of the manner in which records will be disclosed); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa770.21(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c) (requiring a \xe2\x80\x9cbrief statement of the reason or reasons for [a] denial,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as written notification if a record \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be located or has been destroyed\xe2\x80\x9d (italics deleted)).  So, too, have other federal agencies.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 28 CFR \xc2\xa716.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice); 43 CFR \xc2\xa72.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR \xc2\xa71.7 (2010) (Dept. of Agriculture).  Such an agency response plainly is \xe2\x80\x9csomething that gives information,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cnotification,\xe2\x80\x9d and an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial or formal statement of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any records the agency produces along with its written FOIA response are part of that response, \xe2\x80\x9cjust as if they had been reproduced as an appendix to a printed report.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistick</em>, 186 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 384, n.\xc2\xa05.  Nothing in the public disclosure bar suggests that a document and its attachments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.  If an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record attached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d that FOIA response and, therefore, disclosed \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d a report for the purposes of the public disclosure bar.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The DOL\xe2\x80\x99s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk, along with their attached records, are thus reports within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.

We are not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not contradict our holding.  As originally enacted in 1863, the FCA placed no restriction on the sources from which a <em>qui tam </em>relator could acquire information on which to base a lawsuit.  See <em>Graham County</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., \nat 12).  Accordingly, this Court upheld the recovery of a relator, even though the Government claimed that he had discovered the basis for his lawsuit by reading a federal criminal indictment.  See <em>United States ex rel. Marcus</em> v. <em>Hess</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/537/index.html">317 U. S. 537</a> (1943).  In response, Congress amended the statute to preclude such \xe2\x80\x9cparasitic\xe2\x80\x9d <em>qui tam </em>actions based on \xe2\x80\x9cevidence or information in the possession of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 at the time such suit was brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U. S.<em>,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, in 1986, Congress replaced the so-called Government knowledge bar with the narrower public disclosure bar.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded that it would be inconsistent with this drafting history to hold that written FOIA responses are reports.  The court reasoned that doing so would \xe2\x80\x9cessentially resurrect, in a significant subset of cases, the government possession standard \xe2\x80\xa6 repudiated in 1986.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 109.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion.  As a threshold matter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham County,</em> <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 14).  In any event, it is hardly inconsistent with the drafting history to read the public disclosure bar as operating similarly to the Government knowledge bar in a \xe2\x80\x9csubset of cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 109.  As we have observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ather than simply repeal the Government knowledge bar,\xe2\x80\x9d the public disclosure bar was \xe2\x80\x9can effort to strike <em>a balance</em> between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U. S.<em>,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 13) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If anything, the drafting history supports our holding.  The sort of case that Kirk has brought seems to us a classic example of the \xe2\x80\x9copportunistic\xe2\x80\x9d litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although Kirk alleges that he became suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran working at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same FOIA requests and then filed the same suit.  Similarly, anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially reap a windfall in a <em>qui tam </em>action under the FCA.  See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20 (\xe2\x80\x9cGovernment contractors \xe2\x80\xa6 are required to submit certifications related to everything from how they dispose of hazardous materials to their affirmative action plans\xe2\x80\x9d (citing 40 U.

FOIA requires agencies to release some records even absent a request.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552(a)(1), (2).  Kirk argues that it would be strange that two relators could obtain copies of the same document but that only the relator who got the document in response to a FOIA request would find his case barred.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument assumes that records released under FOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not fall within the public disclosure bar.  We do not decide that question.  But even assuming, as Kirk does, that such records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, we are not troubled by the different treatment.  By its plain terms, the public disclosure bar applies to some meth-\nods of public disclosure and not to others.  See <em>Graham County,</em> <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 4) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar \xe2\x80\xa6 deprives courts of jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through <em>certain channels</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  It would not be anomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the public disclosure bar and some did not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also are not concerned that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA request for incriminating documents.  This argument assumes that the public disclosure of information in a written FOIA response forever taints that information for purposes of the public disclosure bar.  But it may be that a relator who comes by that information from a different source has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d the initial public disclosure.  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  That question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we do not resolve it here.  See <em>Glaser</em> v. <em>Wound Care Consultants, Inc.</em>, 570 F.\xc2\xa03d 907, 915 (CA7 2009) (describing the split in authority).  It may also \nbe that such a relator qualifies for the \xe2\x80\x9coriginal source\xe2\x80\x9d \nexception.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the notion that potential defendants will make FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability is pure speculation.  Cf. <em>Graham County</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (rejecting as \xe2\x80\x9cstrained speculation\xe2\x80\x9d an argument that local governments will manipulate the public disclosure bar to escape liability).  There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA responses are \xe2\x80\x9creports\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk and his <em>amici</em> have provided no principled way to define \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents that are indisputably reports.  The Government, for example, struggled to settle on a single definition.  Compare Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19 (\xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d must be read to \xe2\x80\x9creflect a focus on situations in which the government is conducting, or has completed, some focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant facts\xe2\x80\x9d) with <em>id.,</em> at 21 (\xe2\x80\x9cA FOIA response is not a \xe2\x80\x98report\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 because the federal agency is not charged with uncovering the truth of any matter\xe2\x80\x9d), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency \xe2\x80\xa6 is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a substantive analysis of information\xe2\x80\x9d).

See Dept. of Justice, Freedom of Information Act An-\nnual Report, Fiscal Year 2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/\nannual_report/2010/cover.htm (as visited May 12, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual report is a report).  And even if the first definition arguably encompasses that report, it would seem also to include FOIA responses, which convey the results of a Government agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocused inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kirk also was unable to articulate a workable definition.  His various proposed definitions suffer the same deficiencies as the Government\xe2\x80\x99s.  Compare Brief for Respondent 27 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\xe2\x80\x9318 with Brief for Respondent 34\xe2\x80\x9339 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74212(d); 48 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722.1310(b) and 52.222\xe2\x80\x9337(c) (2008).  Respondent Daniel A. Kirk, a Vietnam War veteran and a former employee of petitioner Schindler Elevator Corporation (Schindler), had cause to believe, based on his own experience and observations, that Schindler failed to meet VEVRAA\xe2\x80\x99s annual information-reporting requirements.  To confirm and support his on-the-job observations, Kirk obtained, through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Labor (DOL), copies of Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s VEVRAA filings.  The DOL responses revealed that, in some years, Schindler filed no information, while in some other years, the corporation filed false information.  Armed with the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation of his own impressions, Kirk commenced suit against Schindler under the federal False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73729 <em>et seq.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a carefully developed, highly persuasive opinion, the Second Circuit explained why a federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s response to a FOIA request should not automatically qualify as \na \xe2\x80\x9creport, hearing, audit, or investigation\xe2\x80\x9d preclusive of a whistleblower\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit under the public disclosure bar of the FCA, \xc2\xa73730(e)(4).  I would affirm the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and history of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court finds no \xe2\x80\x9ctextual basis\xe2\x80\x9d for the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statutory language.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion considered text as well as context.  Leaving aside the term \xe2\x80\x9creport,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll of the other terms in [\xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s] list of enumerated sources connote the synthesis of information in an investigatory context.  \xe2\x80\x98[C]riminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings,\xe2\x80\x99 for instance, all entail a government inquiry into a given subject, here into an alleged case of fraud.  Similarly, government \xe2\x80\x98hearing[s and] audit[s]\xe2\x80\x99 are processes by which information is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a government entity\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a given subject or, often, determining whether a party is in compliance with applicable law\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn this context, the term \xe2\x80\x98report\xe2\x80\x99 most readily bears a narrower meaning than simply \xe2\x80\x98something that gives information.\xe2\x80\x99  Rather, it connotes the compilation or analysis of information with the aim of synthesizing that information in order to serve some end of the government, as in a \xe2\x80\x98hearing\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98audit.\xe2\x80\x99  It does not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic production of documents in response to a FOIA request made by a member of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d 94, 107 (2010) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFocusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of Appeals observed that DOL\xe2\x80\x99s responses did not \xe2\x80\x9csynthesize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself gleaning any insight or information, as \xe2\x80\xa6 it necessarily would in conducting a \xe2\x80\x98hearing\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98audit.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 108.  Far from \xe2\x80\x9ccompil[ing] or synthesiz[ing] information to serve its own investigative or analytic ends,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 111, DOL merely assembled and duplicated records, or noted the absence of records.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, moreover, the Second Circuit was mindful of the \xe2\x80\x9cerror we reversed in <em>Graham County </em>[<em>Soil and Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6; the Court of Appeals used the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon only \xe2\x80\x9cas a guide in sifting through the common understandings of \xe2\x80\x98report\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98investigation\xe2\x80\x99 to discover their intended meaning within the FCA.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 108, n.\xc2\xa06.  The court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\xa6 have not used the canon to impose commonality on terms that \xe2\x80\x98do not share any \xe2\x80\xa6 core of meaning,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Graham County</em>, [559 U. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n.\xc2\xa07)].  To the contrary, the terms \xe2\x80\x98hearing,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98report,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98audit,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98investigation\xe2\x80\x99 all refer to processes of uncovering and analyzing information or to the products of those processes.  Our interpretation focuses on their shared \xe2\x80\x98core of meaning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court faults the Court of Appeals for not considering \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creference to \xe2\x80\x98news media,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante</em>, at 7, suggesting that this omission overlooked <em>Graham County</em>\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> of the sources [of public disclosure] listed in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Schindler did not make this argument below.  In any event, the point would have been unavailing.  Disclosures \xe2\x80\x9cof allegations or transactions \xe2\x80\xa6 from the <em>news</em> media,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) (emphasis added), share a common core of meaning with disclosures in other sources that involve \xe2\x80\x9cprocesses of uncovering and analyzing information or \xe2\x80\xa6 the products of those processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 108, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court regards the case Kirk has brought as \xe2\x80\x9ca classic example of the \xe2\x80\x98opportunistic\xe2\x80\x99 litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  But as the Second Circuit observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he facts of this case belie the assertion that individuals who are not original sources and who obtain information through FOIA requests will generally not be persons with firsthand knowledge of fraud but rather will be opportunistic litigators.  The facts also illustrate how an overbroad reading of the jurisdictional bar would prevent an individual with independent but partial knowledge of a possible fraud would be barred from bringing a lawsuit that is neither parasitic nor frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  601 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 110 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By ranking DOL\xe2\x80\x99s ministerial response an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative \xe2\x80\xa6 report,\xe2\x80\x9d akin to a \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment Accounting Office report,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted), the Court weakens the force of the FCA as a weapon against fraud on\nthe part of Government contractors.  Why should a whistleblower attentive to the heightened pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) be barred from court if he seeks corroboration for his allegations, as Kirk did, through a FOIA request simply for copies of a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s filings?  After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, which severely limits whistleblowers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to substantiate their allegations before commencing suit, that question is worthy of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attention.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
