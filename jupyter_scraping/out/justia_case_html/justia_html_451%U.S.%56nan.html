(UPS), employed respondent Mitchell (respondent) as a car washer at its facility on Staten Island, N.Y.  On January 13, 1977, respondent was discharged for dishonest acts, including falsifying his timecards and claiming payment for hours which he did not work.  Respondent denied the charges against him and requested his union, Department Store and Wholesale Drivers, Warehousemen and Helpers, Local Union No. 177 (the Union), to file a grievance on his behalf contesting the discharge.  UPS and the Union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which provided a grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of disputes covered by the agreement.  App. 57-67.  Pursuant to the agreement respondent\'s grievance was submitted to a panel of the Atlantic Area Parcel Grievance Committee, composed of three union and three company representatives (the Joint Panel).  <em>Cf. Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/554/case.html#557">424 U. S. 557</a></span>, n. 2.  The Joint Panel conducted a hearing, at which respondent was represented by the Union, and on February 16, 1977, it announced its decision that the discharge be upheld.  App. 103-104.  Under the collective bargaining agreement, this decision was "binding on all parties."  <em>Id.</em> at 66; <em>see id.</em> at 103.</p>\n<p>Seventeen months later, on July 20, 1978, respondent filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 451 U. S. 59</a></p><p> District of New York against the Union and UPS under \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185(a).  <em>See Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., supra.</em>  He alleged that the Union had breached its duty of fair representation, and that UPS discharged him not for the stated reasons, which it knew to be false, but to achieve savings by replacing full-time employees with part-time employees.  App. 7-13.  Both UPS and the Union moved for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by New York\'s 90-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards.  Section 7511(a) of the N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law (McKinney 1963) provides that " [a]n application to vacate or modify an [arbitration] award may be made by a party within ninety days after its delivery to him."</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS and the Union, ruling that respondent\'s action was properly characterized as one to vacate the arbitration award entered against him.  The court reasoned:</p>\n<p>"The relief sought was expressly denied in an arbitration award issued as a result of a full-scale arbitration proceeding.  The effect of any grant of the relief sought . . . would be to vacate the determination of the arbitrators."</p>\n<p>App. 129.  Respondent appealed and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.  624 F.2d 394 (1980).  That court held that the District Court should have applied New York\'s 6-year limitations period for actions alleging breach of contract, N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 213 (2) (McKinney 1972).  It reasoned that respondent\'s action was analogous to a breach of contract action because the issues were whether the collective bargaining agreement had been breached and whether the Union contributed to that breach by failure to discharge its duty of fair representation.  The court further reasoned that a 6-year limitations period</p>\n<p>"provides for relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes without undermining an employee\'s ability to vindicate his rights through \xc2\xa7 301 actions."</p>\n<p>624 F.2d at 397-398. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 451 U.

Respondent raises in his \xc2\xa7 301 action the same claim that was raised before the Joint Panel -- that he was discharged in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.  He seeks the same relief he sought before the Joint Panel -- reinstatement with full backpay.  In sum, "it is clear that [he] was dissatisfied with, and simply seeks to upset, the arbitrator\'s decision that the company did not wrongfully discharge him."</p>\n<p><em>Liotta v.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals purported to rely on this Court\'s decision in <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc.,</em> but that decision strongly supports borrowing the limitations period for actions to vacate arbitration awards.  As <em>Hines</em> makes clear, an employee may go behind a final and binding award under a collective bargaining agreement and seek relief against his employer and union only when he demonstrates that his union\'s breach of its duty "seriously undermine[d] the integrity of the arbitral process."  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/554/case.html#567">424 U.

S. 571</a></span>, suggesting that the suits it sanctioned are aptly characterized as ones to vacate such arbitration decisions.  Indeed, the present </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 451 U. S. 62</a></p><p> writer, though in dissent on the merits in <em>Hines,</em> characterized the action as one to "vacate an . . . arbitration award."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/554/case.html#575">424 U.

S. 336</a></span> (1964) (issue characterized as whether to enjoin implementation of decision of joint panel).</p>\n<p>It is true that respondent\'s underlying claim against his employer is based on the collective bargaining agreement, a contract.  It is not enough, however, for an employee such as respondent to prove that he was discharged in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>"To prevail against either the company or the Union, petitioners must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract, but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the Union. . . .  The grievance processes cannot be expected to be error-free."</p>\n<p><em>Hines,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/554/case.html#570">424 U.

Thus, respondent\'s characterization of his action against the employer as one for "breach of contract" ignores the significance of the fact that it was brought in the District Court pursuant to \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the LMRA, and that the indispensable predicate for such an action is not a showing under traditional contract law that the discharge was a breach of the collective bargaining agreement, but instead a demonstration that the Union breached its duty of fair representation.  Since the conclusion of the Joint Panel was, under the collective bargaining agreement, "binding on all parties," respondent was required in some way to show that the Union\'s duty to represent him fairly at the arbitration had been breached before he was entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim.  This, in our view, makes the suit more analogous to an action to vacate an arbitration award than to a straight contract action. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 451 U. S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We think that the unfair representation claim made by an employee against his union, even though his employer may ultimately be called upon to respond in damages for it if he is successful, is more a creature of "labor law" as it has developed since the enactment of \xc2\xa7 301 than it is of general contract law.  We said in <em>Hoosier Cardinal</em> that one of the leading federal policies in this area is the "relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes."  383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html#707">383 U. S. 707</a></span>.  <em>Cf.</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(b) (6-month period under NLRA).  This policy was one of the reasons the Court in <em>Hoosier Cardinal</em> chose the generally shorter period for actions based on an oral contract, rather than that for actions upon a written contract, 383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html#707">383 U. S. 707</a></span>, and similar analysis supports our adoption of the shorter period for actions to vacate an arbitration award in this case. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>It is important to bear in mind the observations made in the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy</em> that</p>\n<p>"the grievance machinery under a collective bargaining agreement is at the very heart of the system of industrial self-government. . . .  The processing . . . machinery is actually a vehicle by which meaning and content are given to the collective bargaining agreement."</p>\n<p><em>Steelworkers v. Warrior Gulf Navigation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/574/case.html">363 U.

Although the present case involves a fairly mundane </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 451 U. S. 64</a></p><p> and discrete wrongful discharge complaint, the grievance and arbitration procedure often processes disputes involving interpretation of critical terms in the collective bargaining agreement affecting the entire relationship between company and union.  <em>See, e.g., Humphrey v. Moore, supra</em> (seniority rights of all employees).  This system, with its heavy emphasis on grievance, arbitration, and the "law of the shop," could easily become unworkable if a decision which has given "meaning and content" to the terms of an agreement, and even affected subsequent modifications of the agreement, could suddenly be called into question as much as six years later.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if New York had adopted a specific 6-year statute of limitations for employee challenges to awards of a joint panel or similar body, we would be bound to apply that statute under the reasoning of <em>Hoosier Cardinal.</em>  But in cases such as this, where generally state limitations periods were enacted prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa7 301 by Congress in 1947, we are necessarily committed by prior decisional law to choosing among statutes of limitations none of which fit hand in glove with an action under \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the LMRA.  Given the choices present here, and the undesirability of the results of the grievance and arbitral process being suspended in limbo for long periods, we think the District Court was correct when it chose the 90-day period imposed by New York for the bringing of an action to vacate an arbitration award.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>A direct conflict in the Circuits developed when the Third Circuit, confronted with the present question, borrowed the 3-month period contained in Pennsylvania\'s arbitration statute, reversing a District Court decision borrowing the State\'s 6-year period for actions upon a contract.  <em>Liotta v.

The AFL-CIO distinguishes the above-quoted language from <em>Hoosier Cardinal</em> on the ground that <em>Hoosier Cardinal</em> involved a \xc2\xa7 301 action by a union against an employer, while actions brought by employees against both their union and employer pursuant to our decisions in <em>Vaca v.

The fact that an employee could not bring a direct suit to vacate an arbitration award, however, does not mean that his \xc2\xa7 301 claim, which, if successful, would have the same effect, is not "closely analogous" to such an action.  <em>See Johnson v.

But here, unlike <em>Hoosier,</em> the latter action, like the breach of duty claim, is a challenge to a result reached in the contractual grievance resolution system.

Even if there are some breaches of the representation duty that are not unfair labor practices under the NLRA, \xc2\xa7 10(b) is, I believe, the proper source for determining when claims of breach of duty must be raised.

S. 72</a></p><p> Court\'s resolution of that question, I fear that its failure expressly to limit its reasoning to the narrow question presented in this case may suggest that today\'s decision also resolves the question whether the same statute of limitations governs the employee\'s claim against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation.  That interpretation, although understandable in light of the broad language of the Court\'s opinion, would be inconsistent with the procedural posture of this case, and, in addition, would be conceptually unsound.</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court\'s conclusion that it is appropriate, for purposes of federal labor law, to characterize the employee\'s suit against his employer as an action to set aside an arbitration award.  In the arbitration proceeding that took place prior to this litigation, the employer prevailed on the precise claim respondent raises against it in this judicial proceeding -- that the discharge violated the collective bargaining agreement.  If the employee now were to prevail against the employer on this claim, the necessary effect of the resulting court order would be to undo the arbitration award.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#61">451 U. S. 61</a></span>.  Accordingly, in upholding the employer\'s position, the Court properly emphasizes the importance of the finality and certainty of arbitration in the collective bargaining context, and properly treats the adverse arbitration decision as a substantial obstacle to the employee\'s pursuit of judicial relief against his employer.</p>\n<p>The employee\'s claim against his union for breach of the duty of fair representation, however, is of a far different character.  Although this claim is closely related to the claim </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 451 U. S. 73</a></p><p> against the employer, the two claims are nonetheless conceptually distinct. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  The claim against the union may not, in my judgment, be characterized as an action to vacate an arbitration award.  The arbitration proceeding did not, and indeed, could not, [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] resolve the employee\'s claim against the union.  Although the union was a party to the arbitration, it acted only as the employee\'s representative; the Joint Panel did not address or resolve any dispute between the employee and the union.  Therefore, with respect to the employee\'s action against the union, the finality and certainty of arbitration are not threatened by the prospect that the employee might prevail on his judicial claim.  Because no arbitrator has decided the primary issue presented by this claim, no arbitration award need be undone, even if the employee ultimately prevails. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 451 U. S. 74</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The employee\'s claim against his union is properly characterized not as an action to vacate an arbitration award, but rather as a malpractice claim.  There is no conceptual reason why that claim may not survive even if the employer is able to rely on the arbitration award as a conclusive determination of its obligations under the collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Thus, by analogy, a lawyer who negligently allows the statute of limitations to run on his client\'s valid claim may be liable to his client even though the original defendant no longer has any exposure.  <em>Cf. Smart v. Ellis Trucking Co.,</em> 580 F.2d 215, 218-219 (CA6 1978), <em>cert. denied,</em> 440 U.S. 958.</p>\n<p>In this case, I agree with the Court that the statute of limitations applicable to respondent\'s claim against his former employer is the 90-day statute governing actions to vacate or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 451 U. S. 75</a></p><p> modify arbitration awards in New York. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  It surely does not follow, however, that that statute is applicable to the claim against the union for breach of its duty of fair representation. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Because the union did not seek review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, it is not appropriate to decide what period of limitations should be applied to the employee\'s claim against it.  It is, however, noteworthy that JUSTICE STEWART\'s proposal that we strain to conclude that Congress intended that \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(b), [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>] be applied to causes of action that this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 451 U. S. 76</a></p><p> Court had not yet divined when \xc2\xa7 10(b) was enacted, [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>] <em>cf. Watt v. Alaska, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/259/case.html#276">451 U. S. 276</a></span> (STEWART, J., dissenting), rests on a rationale that might apply to a \xc2\xa7 301 claim against the union, but which is wholly inapplicable to the claim against the employer, because the employer is not accused of any unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p>In sum, I concur in the Court\'s judgment insofar as it pertains to the employee\'s action against his employer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The union did not petition for review of the Court of Appeals\' decision, and the employer has not taken a position with respect to which statute of limitations governs the employee\'s claim against the union.  Indeed, the employer has vigorously denied that this question is presented in this case:</p>\n<p>"[T]he only question raised in the petition for certiorari is the statute of limitations applicable to Mitchell\'s claim against his employer, UPS.  <em>See Liotta v. National Forge Co.,</em> 629 F.2d 903 (3d Cir 1980)."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The fact that Mitchell may have a claim against the Union does not affect the determination of which statute of limitations governs his claim against his employer.  <em>See Liotta v. National Forge Co., supra,</em> 629 F.2d at 905."</p>\n<p>Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, 4.  <em>See also id.</em> at 5-6.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The claims are closely related because, to prevail against the employer, the employee must establish that the union breached its duty of fair representation and that the employer breached the collective bargaining agreement; similarly, to prevail against the union, the employee must prove that the union breached its duty of fair representation and, if he wishes to recover loss of employment damages for which the union is responsible, that the employer breached the agreement.  <em>See</em> <l=|451 4|="" 56fn3="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>infra.</em> <em>Cf. Czosek v. O\'Mara,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/25/case.html">397 U. S. 25</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/25/case.html#28">397 U. S. 28</a></span>-29.  However, despite this close relationship, the two claims are not inseparable.  Indeed, although the employee in this case chose to sue both the employer and the union, he was not required to do so; he was free to institute suit against either one as the sole defendant.  <em>See Vaca v. Sipes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html">386 U. S. 171</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#186">386 U. S. 186</a></span>-187.</l=|451></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>By its very nature, the employee\'s claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation cannot be resolved in an arbitration proceeding because it arises out of the conduct of that proceeding itself.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/4" name="F3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>While an arbitration decision favorable to the employer -- for example, that the discharge did not breach the collective bargaining agreement -- would be of substantial significance in an employee\'s suit against his union, it would not necessarily be dispositive.  The determination whether the employer breached the agreement may be highly relevant to the amount of damages caused by the union\'s alleged breach of duty, but it is not necessarily controlling with respect to the threshold question whether there was any breach of duty by the union at all.  For example, if, solely for reasons of racial bias, a union processes a discharged employee\'s grievance in bad faith, the union breaches its duty of fair representation.  <em>Cf. Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/192/case.html">323 U. S. 192</a></span>.  The fact that the underlying discharge may not have violated the collective bargaining agreement does not necessarily absolve the union of liability for its breach, although it may limit the size of the employee\'s recovery against the union.  Thus, while a court considering an employee\'s claim against a union will evaluate the validity of the employer\'s underlying conduct, that evaluation is not central to the resolution of the duty of fair representation claim.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Liotta v. National Forge Co.,</em> 629 F.2d 903 (CA3 1980), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 80-890, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Pennsylvania statute of limitations governing actions to vacate arbitration awards should apply to an employee\'s \xc2\xa7 301 action against his employer for wrongful discharge.  However, in <em>Liotta,</em> the employee had filed suit only against his employer, and not against his union.  The Court of Appeals suggested that this fact was of some significance in determining which statute of limitations to apply:</p>\n<p>"[T]he fact that Liotta alleges that the arbitration award is invalid due to the Union\'s breach of its duty of fair representation does not change the limitations period, because the suit here is against the Company, and not the Union.  Thus, it is clear that Liotta was dissatisfied with, and simply seeks to upset, the arbitrator\'s decision that the Company did not wrongfully discharge him."</p>\n<p>629 F.2d at 90906.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/6" name="F3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 7511(a) (McKinney 1963), quoted <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#59">451 U.

I do not address any question concerning the possible tolling of that period, because no such issue is presented in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Under the rationale of <em>Auto Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html">383 U.

Because the question of the appropriate statute of limitations to apply to the employee\'s claim against his union is not properly presented in this case, I express no definite opinion on the point.  I note, however, that the Court dismisses the suggestion that this action may be characterized as a malpractice action with the observation that this characterization "overlook[s] the fact that an arbitration award stands between the employee and any relief which may be awarded against <em>the company.</em>"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#63">451 U.

Because no arbitration award stands between the employee and any relief which may be awarded against the union, this observation is inapplicable to the claim against the union.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/8" name="F3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act provides:</p>\n<p>"Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the [National Labor Relations] Board, or any agent or agency designated by the Board for such purposes, shall have power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the Board or a member thereof, or before a designated agent or agency, at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of said complaint:  <em>Provided,</em> That no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing such charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge.  Any such complaint may be amended by the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board in its discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon.

The plain language of this statute indicates that it is directed solely to the administrative procedure established by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act for the resolution of unfair labor practice charges arising under, and processed in accordance with, that Act.  Nothing in the statutory language suggests that Congress intended that this 6-month limitations period be applied in any other context.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/9" name="F3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]</p>\n<p>The National Labor Relations Act was enacted in 1935.  49 Stat. 449.  Although \xc2\xa7 10(b) was a part of the Act at that time, in its original form, it did not contain a period of limitations.  49 Stat. 453-454.  The 6-month limitations period upon which JUSTICE STEWART relies was added to \xc2\xa7 10(b) in 1947.  61 Stat. 146.  Six years later, the Court decided the first in a series of cases recognizing that the National Labor Relations Act imposes a duty of fair representation upon unions.  <em>See Ford Motor Co. v.
