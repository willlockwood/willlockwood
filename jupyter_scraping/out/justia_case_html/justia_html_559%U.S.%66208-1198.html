AnimalFeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.  The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbitration clause.  AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling that the charterers\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not subject to arbitration.  As a consequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.  AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services.  The parties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agreement allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American Arbitration Association following <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em> v. <em>Bazzle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/444/index.html">539 U. S. 444</a>.  One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to determine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration.  The parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on the class arbitration issue.  The panel determined that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court vacated the award.  It concluded that the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 award was made in \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard\xe2\x80\x9d of the law, for had the arbitrators conducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of custom and usage.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that because petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of custom and usage <em>against</em> class arbitration, the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 decision was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitrators had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not established a rule against class arbitration. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to authorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.

P. 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 public policy argument for permitting class arbitration under the charter party\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause.  However, because the parties agreed that their agreement was \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on the class arbitration issue, the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 proper task was to identify the rule of law governing in that situation.  Instead, the panel based its decision on post-<em>Bazzle</em> arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.  Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a \xe2\x80\x9cdefault rule\xe2\x80\x9d permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitration absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a common-law court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule for such a situation.  Finding no reason to depart from its perception of a post-<em>Bazzle</em> consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration.  The panel\xe2\x80\x99s few references to intent do not show that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference.  Thus, under FAA \xc2\xa710(b), this Court must either \xe2\x80\x9cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x9d or decide the question originally referred to the panel.  Because there can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Bazzle </em>did not control resolution of the question whether the instant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this class.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0No single rationale commanded a majority in<em> Bazzle, </em>which concerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers that had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class arbitration.  The plurality decided only the question whether the court or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.  Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on his resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate decisionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The <em>Bazzle </em>opinions appear to have baffled these parties at their arbitration proceeding.  For one thing, the parties appear to have believed that <em>Bazzle</em> requires an arbitrator, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question addressed only by the plurality.  That question need not be revisited here because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.  Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have misunderstood <em>Bazzle</em> as establishing the standard to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration is permitted.  However, <em>Bazzle</em> left that question open.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including the basic precept that arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter of consent, not coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Volt</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a>, 479.  The FAA requires that a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision in any maritime transaction\xe2\x80\x9d calling for the arbitration of a controversy arising out of such transaction \xe2\x80\x9cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\xe2\x80\x9d 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72, and permits a party to an arbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order directing that arbitration proceed \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner provided for in such agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74.  Thus, this Court has said that the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s central purpose is to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cprivate agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Volt, </em>489 U. S.,<em> </em>at 479.  Whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause, courts and arbitrators must \xe2\x80\x9cgive effect to the [parties\xe2\x80\x99] contractual rights and expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

They may also specify <em>with whom</em> they choose to arbitrate their disputes.  See <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Waffle House, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/279/index.html">534 U. S. 279</a>, 289.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party <em>agreed</em> to do so.  Here, the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration despite the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation that they had reached \xe2\x80\x9cno agreement\xe2\x80\x9d on that issue.  The panel\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.  It may be appropriate to presume that parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitrator to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  See <em>Howsam</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/79/index.html">537 U. S. 79</a>, 84.  But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an agreement to arbitrate.  The differences between simple bilateral and complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.

One of those customers is AnimalFeeds International Corp. (hereinafter AnimalFeeds), which supplies raw ingredients, such as fish oil, to animal-feed producers around the world.  AnimalFeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Numerous charter parties are in regular use, and the charter party that AnimalFeeds uses is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cVegoilvoy\xe2\x80\x9d charter party.  Petitioners assert, without contradiction, that charterers like AnimalFeeds, or their agents\xe2\x80\x94not the shipowners\xe2\x80\x94typically select the particular charter party that governs their shipments.

When AnimalFeeds learned of this, it brought a putative class action against petitioners in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting antitrust claims for supracompetitive prices that petitioners allegedly charged their customers over a period of several years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other charterers brought similar suits.  In one of these, the District Court for the District of Connecticut held that the charterers\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not subject to arbitration under the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second Circuit reversed.  See <em>JLM Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d 163, 183 (2004).  While that appeal was pending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against petitioners, including AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 action, in the District of Connecticut.

The parties entered into a supplemental agreement providing for the question of class arbitration to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American Arbitration Association\xe2\x80\x99s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a.  These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were developed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) after our decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em> v. <em>Bazzle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/444/index.html">539 U. S. 444</a> (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with the plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator, as a threshold matter, to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 56a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipulated that the arbitration clause was \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to class arbitration.  Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to the arbitration panel that the term \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d did not simply mean that the clause made no express reference to class arbitration.  Rather, he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there\xe2\x80\x99s been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,\n</em>at 77a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After hearing argument and evidence, including testimony from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 experts regarding arbitration customs and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators concluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration.  They found persuasive the fact that other arbitrators ruling after <em>Bazzle</em> had construed \xe2\x80\x9ca wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d but the panel acknowledged that none of these decisions was \xe2\x80\x9cexactly comparable\xe2\x80\x9d to the present dispute.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\xe2\x80\x9350a.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert evidence did not show an \xe2\x80\x9cinten[t] to preclude class arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d the arbitrators reasoned, and petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument would leave \xe2\x80\x9cno basis for a class action absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class members.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 51a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the parties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an application to vacate the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 award in the District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The District Court vacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 decision was made in \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard\xe2\x80\x9d of the law insofar as the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analysis.  435 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 382, 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (SDNY 2006).

In that situation, an arbitration decision may be vacated under \xc2\xa710(a)(4) of the FAA on the ground that the arbitrator \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded [his] powers,\xe2\x80\x9d for the task of an arbitrator is to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.

Instead, the panel appears to have rested its decision on AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 public policy argument.  Because the parties agreed their agreement was \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the issue of class arbitration, the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 proper task was to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.  Had they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably would have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing, <em>i.e.</em>, either federal maritime law or New York law.  But the panel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule of decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or New York law in the case of a \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d contract.  Instead, the panel based its decision on post-<em>Bazzle</em> arbitral decisions that \xe2\x80\x9cconstrued a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\xe2\x80\x9350a.  The panel did not mention whether any of these decisions were based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law, or New York law contains a \xe2\x80\x9cdefault rule\xe2\x80\x9d under which an arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had the authority of a common-law court to develop what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a situation.  Perceiving a post-<em>Bazzle</em> consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in \xe2\x80\x9ca wide variety of settings,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel considered only whether there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in this case.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\xe2\x80\x9350a.  The panel was not persuaded by \xe2\x80\x9ccourt cases denying consolidation of arbitrations,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy charter party had \xe2\x80\x9cnever been the basis of a class action,\xe2\x80\x9d or by expert opinion that \xe2\x80\x9csophisticated, multinational commercial parties of the type that are sought to be included in the class would never intend that the arbitration clauses would permit a class arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 50a\xe2\x80\x9351a.  Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for departing from the post-<em>Bazzle</em> arbitral consensus, the panel held that class arbitration was permitted in this case.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  The conclusion is inescapable that the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references to intent, but none of these shows that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference.  The opinion states that, under <em>Bazzle</em>, \xe2\x80\x9carbitrators must look to the language of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to ascertain the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action,\xe2\x80\x9d and the panel added that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his is also consistent with New York law.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  But the panel had no occasion to \xe2\x80\x9cascertain the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intention\xe2\x80\x9d in the present case because the parties were in complete agreement regarding their intent.  In the very next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the Vegoilvoy charter party was \xe2\x80\x9csilent on whether [it] permit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d but that the charter party was \xe2\x80\x9cnot ambiguous so as to call for parol evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent, and any inquiry into that settled question would have been outside the panel\xe2\x80\x99s assigned task.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The panel also commented on the breadth of the language in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see <em>id.</em>, at 50a, but since the only task that was left for the panel, in light of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation, was to identify the governing rule applicable in a case in which neither the language of the contract nor any other evidence established that the parties had reached any agreement on the question of class arbitration, the particular wording of the charter party was quite beside the point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New York law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy choice and thus exceeded its powers.  As a result, under \xc2\xa710(b) of the FAA, we must either \xe2\x80\x9cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x9d or decide the question that was originally referred to the panel.  Because we conclude that there can be only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arbitration panel thought that <em>Bazzle</em> \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cresolution\xe2\x80\x9d of the question whether the Vegoilvoy charter party \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[s] this arbitration to proceed on behalf of a class,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\xe2\x80\x9349a, but that understanding was incorrect.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bazzle</em> concerned contracts between a commercial lender (Green Tree) and its customers.  These contracts con-\ntained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention class arbitration.  Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the customers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the awards.  <em>Bazzle </em>v<em>. Green Tree Financial Corp</em>., 351 S.\xc2\xa0C. 244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002).  After discussing both Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority to order classwide arbitration under \xc2\xa74 of the FAA, see <em>Champ </em>v.<em> Siegel Trading Co., </em>55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and conflicting California precedent, see <em>Keating </em>v.<em> Superior Court of Alameda Cty.</em>, 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P.\xc2\xa02d 1192 (1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the California approach, which it characterized as permitting a trial court to \xe2\x80\x9corder class-wide arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d 351 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 259, 266, 569 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 357, 360.

The Court described its holding as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e \xe2\x80\xa6 hold that class-wide arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it would serve efficiency and equity, and would not result in prejudice.  If we enforced a mandatory, adhesive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting party could effectively prevent class actions against\nit without having to say it was doing so in the\nagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 266, 569 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 360 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When <em>Bazzle</em> reached this Court, no single rationale commanded a majority.  The opinions of the Justices who joined the judgment\xe2\x80\x94that is, the plurality opinion and Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion\xe2\x80\x94collectively addressed three separate questions.  The first was which decision maker (court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts in question were \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue of class arbitration.  The second was what standard the appropriate decision maker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration.  (For example, does the FAA entirely preclude class arbitration?  Does the FAA permit class arbitration only under limited circumstances, such as when the contract expressly so provides?  Or is this question left entirely to state law?)  The final question was whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality opinion decided only the first question, concluding that the arbitrator and not a court should decide whether the contracts were indeed \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue of class arbitration.  The plurality noted that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n certain limited circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9cgateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d it is assumed \xe2\x80\x9cthat the parties intended courts, not arbitrators,\xe2\x80\x9d to make the decision.  539 U. S., at 452.  But the plurality opined that the question whether a contract with an arbitration clause forbids class arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not fall into this narrow exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The plurality therefore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme Court should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question whether the contracts were indeed \xe2\x80\x9csilent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The plurality did not decide either the second or the third question noted above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment vacating and remanding because otherwise there would have been \xe2\x80\x9cno controlling judgment of the Court,\xe2\x80\x9d but he did not endorse the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  <em>Id.,</em> at 455 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).  He did not take a definitive position on the first question, stating only that <em>\xe2\x80\x9c[a]rguably</em> the interpretation of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  But because he did not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of the appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach that question and, instead, would have affirmed the decision of the State Supreme Court on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, his analysis bypassed the first question noted above and rested instead on his resolution of the second and third questions.  Thus, <em>Bazzle</em> did not yield a majority decision on any of the three questions.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the opinions in <em>Bazzle </em>appear to have baffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitration proceeding.  For one thing, the parties appear to have believed that the judgment in <em>Bazzle</em> requires an arbitrator, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration.  See App. 89a (transcript of argument before arbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat <em>[Bazzle]</em> says is that the contract interpretation issue is left up to the arbitrator, that\xe2\x80\x99s the rule in <em>[Bazzle]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, however, only the plurality decided that question.  But we need not revisit that question here because the parties\xe2\x80\x99 supplemental agreement expressly assigned this issue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbitration panel seem to have misunderstood <em>Bazzle</em> in another respect, namely, that it established the standard to be applied by a decision maker in determining whether a contract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class arbitration.  The arbitration panel began its discussion by stating that the parties \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer regarding <em>the rule of interpretation</em> to be gleaned from [the <em>Bazzle</em>] decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added).  The panel continued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cClaimants argue that <em>Bazzle</em> requires clear language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class action.

The panel\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that parties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are necessary to give effect to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  Thus, we have said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition\xe2\x80\x99 are presumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howsam</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/79/index.html">537 U. S. 79</a>, 84 (2002) (quoting <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</em> v. <em>Livingston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/543/index.html">376 U. S. 543</a>, 557 (1964)).  This recognition is grounded in the background principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7204 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate.  This is so because class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.  In bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.  See <em>Gilmer</em> v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/20/index.html">500 U. S. 20</a>, 31 (1991); <em>Mitsubishi Motors</em>, 473 U. S., at 628; see also <em>14 Penn Plaza LLC</em> v. <em>Pyett</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938) (\xe2\x80\x9cParties generally favor arbitration precisely because of the economics of dispute resolution\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/105/index.html">532 U.

But the relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much less assured, giving reason to doubt the parties\xe2\x80\x99 mutual consent to resolve disputes through class-wide arbitration.  Cf. <em>First Options</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 945 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cone can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the \xe2\x80\x98who should decide arbitrability\xe2\x80\x99 point as giving the arbitrators that power, for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x9d contrary to their expectations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider just some of the fundamental changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration.  An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed-upon procedure, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 2, no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement, but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties.  See App. 86a (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e believe domestic class members could be in the hundreds\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here could be class members that ship to and from the U. S. who are not domestic who we think would be covered\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bazzle</em>, 351 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 251, 569 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals that was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than $14 million by a single arbitrator).  Under the Class Rules, \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption of privacy and confidentiality\xe2\x80\x9d that applies in many bilateral arbitrations \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply in class arbitrations,\xe2\x80\x9d see Addendum to Brief for American Arbitration Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10a (Class Rule 9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties\xe2\x80\x99 assumptions when they agreed to arbitrate.  The arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well.  Cf. <em>Ortiz</em> v. <em>Fibreboard Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/815/index.html">527 U. S. 815</a>, 846 (1999) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of justification rests on the exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the general rule that \xe2\x80\x9cone is not bound by a judgment <em>in personam</em> in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And the commercial stakes of class-action arbitration are comparable to those of class-action litigation, cf. App. in No. 06\xe2\x80\x933474\xe2\x80\x93cv (CA2), at A\xe2\x80\x9377, A\xe2\x80\x9379, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb630, 31, 40, even though the scope of judicial review is much more limited, see <em>Hall Street</em>, 552 U. S., at 588.  We think that the differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume, consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being merely what \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural mode\xe2\x80\x9d was available to present AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  <em>Post</em>, at 9.  If the question were that simple, there would be no need to consider the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent with respect to class arbitration.  See <em>Howsam</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 84 (committing \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural questions\xe2\x80\x9d presumptively to the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s discretion (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But the FAA requires more.  Contrary to the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the question as being whether the parties <em>agreed to</em> <em>authorize</em> class arbitration.  Here, where the parties stipulated that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno agreement\xe2\x80\x9d on this question, it follows that the parties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to class arbitration.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[C]harter parties are commonly drafted using highly standardized forms specific to the particular trades and business needs of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Comment, A Comparative Analysis of Charter Party Agreements \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Subject to</em>\xe2\x80\x9d Respective American and British Laws and Decisions \xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s All in the Details, 26 Tulane Mar.

See <em>post</em>, at 1, 3\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  In so doing, the dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument \xe2\x80\x9cwe necessarily considered and rejected\xe2\x80\x9d in granting certiorari.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/36/index.html">504 U. S. 36</a>, 40 (1992).  Ripeness reflects constitutional considerations that implicate \xe2\x80\x9cArticle III limitations on judicial power,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reno</em> v. <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/43/index.html">509 U. S. 43</a>, 57, n. 18 (1993).  In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial review, we consider both \xe2\x80\x9cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe hardship of withholding court consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Park Hospitality Assn.</em> v. <em>Department of Interior</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/803/index.html">538 U. S. 803</a>, 808 (2003).  To the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we granted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.  The arbitration panel\xe2\x80\x99s award means that petitioners must now submit to class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners are correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis.  See Class Rule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em>\xc2\xa017.  Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what they maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would almost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74.  Cf. <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/index.html">419 U. S. 102</a>, 143 (1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the disputed provisions will come into effect\xe2\x80\x9d).  We think it is clear on these facts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that their question is fit for our review at this time.  To the extent the dissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that argument as waived, <em>Sprietsma</em> v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U. S. 51</a>, 56, n.\xc2\xa04 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver.  We express no view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a question of prudential ripeness on its own motion.  See <em>National Park Hospitality Assn.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 808 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven in a case raising only prudential concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court\xe2\x80\x99s own motion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not decide whether \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98manifest disregard\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d survives our decision in <em>Hall Street Associates, L.

AnimalFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the arbitrators \xe2\x80\x9cknew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this principle controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless willfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted).

All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA\xe2\x80\x99s Class Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available when the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during the class period ranging from 1998 to 2002.  See 548 F.\xc2\xa03d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (defining the class period).  Indeed, at the hearing before the panel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen you talk about expectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were the subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before <em>[Bazzle]</em>.  So therefore, if you are going to talk about the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intentions, pre<em>-[Bazzle]</em> class arbitrations were not common, post <em>[Bazzle]</em> they are common.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 87a.  Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to acknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a contract between sophisticated business entities.

Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the arbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when they entered into their contracts.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime arbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business for parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the 30 years I have been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered an arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as allowing class action arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 139a (expert declaration of Bruce Harris) (\xe2\x80\x9cI have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty years and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the issue of a class action arbitration has even been raised\xe2\x80\x9d).  These experts amplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class action in a maritime arbitration would be \xe2\x80\x9cquite foreign\xe2\x80\x9d to overseas shipping executives and charterers); <em>id.</em>, at 111a\xe2\x80\x93112a (Mr. Harris) (opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitration, class arbitration is \xe2\x80\x9cinconceivable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\nUnder both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of \xe2\x80\x9ccustom and usage\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant to determining the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent when an express agreement is ambiguous.

That court action terminated when the Second Circuit held, first, that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 transactions were governed by contracts (charter parties) with enforceable arbitration clauses, and second, that the antitrust claims were arbitrable.  <em>JLM Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d 163, 175, 181 (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cargo-shipper AnimalFeeds International Corp.

Recall that the parties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide, initially, whether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts permitted class proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2.  The panel did just what it was commissioned to do.  It construed the broad arbitration clause (covering \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny dispute arising from the making, performance or termination of this Charter Party,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled, expressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbitration.  The Court acts without warrant in allowing Stolt-Nielsen essentially to repudiate its submission of the contract-construction issue to the arbitration panel, and to gain, in place of the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>de novo</em> determination.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controlling FAA prescription, \xc2\xa710(a),[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] authorizes a court to vacate an arbitration panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9conly in very unusual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html">514 U.

The question under that provision is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the arbitrators had the power, based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions or the arbitration agreement, to reach a certain issue, not whether the arbitrators correctly decided that issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DiRussa</em> v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</em>, 121 F.\xc2\xa03d 818, 824 (CA2 1997); <em>Comprehensive Accounting Corp.</em> v. <em>Rudell</em>, 760 F.\xc2\xa02d 138, 140 (CA7 1985).  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 supplemental agreement, referring the class-arbitration issue to an arbitration panel, undoubtedly empowered the arbitrators to render their clause-construction decision.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion that the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal maritime law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to Rule 3 of the American Arbitration Association\xe2\x80\x99s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49a\xe2\x80\x9350a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the argument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.</em> v. <em>Bazzle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/444/index.html">539 U.

Counsel quickly clarified his position: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also undisputed that the arbitration clause here contains broad language and this language should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 79a.

That concern, the panel suggested, might be met at a later stage; \xe2\x80\x9cif a class is certified,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel noted, class membership could be confined to those who affirmatively \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98opt in\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the proceeding.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question properly before the Court is not whether the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 ruling was erroneous, but whether the arbitrators \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa710(a)(4).  The arbitrators decided a threshold issue, explicitly committed to them, see <em>supra</em>, at 2, about the procedural mode available for presentation of AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 antitrust claims.

Parties may \xe2\x80\x9cspecify <em>with whom</em> they choose to arbitrate,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observes, just as they may \xe2\x80\x9climit the issues they choose to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  But arbitrators, in delineating an appropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard such contractual constraints.

See <em>ibid.</em>  The question, however, is the proper default rule when there is no stipulation.  Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a species of forum-selection clauses.  See <em>Scherk</em> v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/506/index.html">417 U. S. 506</a>, 519 (1974).  Suppose the parties had chosen a New York <em>judicial forum</em> for resolution of \xe2\x80\x9cany dispute\xe2\x80\x9d involving a contract for ocean carriage of goods.  There is little question that the designated court, state or federal, would have authority to conduct claims like AnimalFeeds\xe2\x80\x99 on a class basis.  Why should the class-action prospect vanish when the \xe2\x80\x9cany dispute\xe2\x80\x9d clause is contained in an arbitration agreement?  Cf. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada</em>, 210 F.\xc2\xa03d 771, 774\xe2\x80\x93776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny dispute\xe2\x80\x9d to permit consolidation of arbitrations).  If the Court is right that arbitrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class proceedings, see <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, then the claimant should retain its right to proceed in that format in court.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no more than modest in size, class proceedings may be \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, without them, potential claimants will have little, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.  <em>Amchem Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>Windsor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/591/index.html">521 U. S. 591</a>, 617 (1997); <em>Carnegie</em> v. <em>Household Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em>, 376 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>realistic</em> alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Mindful that disallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the dimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can mount, I note some stopping points in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court does not insist on express consent to class arbitration.  Class arbitration may be ordered if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the part[ies] <em>agreed</em>\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto submit to class arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20; see <em>ante</em>, at 23, n.\xc2\xa010 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support a finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, by observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties [here] are sophisticated business entities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court apparently spares from its affirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhesion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  While these qualifications limit the scope of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 judgment should not have been disturbed.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition for want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.
