Bonds of a township in Kansas payable to A., a railroad company, or bearer, were duly executed by the township trustee and township clerk, acting in their official capacity as its legal representatives.  They recite that they were issued pursuant to an order of the proper officers of the township, made by authority of an act of the legislature which is therein cited, and were ordered by the qualified electors of the township, at an election duly held.  An action was brought by a <em>bona fide</em> holder for value of the interest coupons attached to some of the bonds who had no notice of any fact impairing their validity.   <em>Held</em> that it is not a defense to the action that at the time of voting and that of issuing the bonds their entire amount was in excess of the proportion which by law they should bear to the taxable property of the township, or that after the vote at said election had bean cast in favor of subscribing for stock in B., a railroad company, the subscription was made for stock in A., and said bonds issued in payment therefor, B. having, under a law existing at the time of said election, become merged and consolidated with A. to form a continuous line of road.</p>\n<p>2.

That the bonds mentioned in plaintiff\'s petition, and to which the coupons in suit were attached, are void because the whole issue was $75,000, and the taxable wealth of the township was, in 1871, prior to the vote on subscription, $148,686; in 1872, prior to the issue of the bonds, $181,591; and in 1873, prior to the maturity of the coupons first falling due, $159,557.</p>\n<p>2. That said bonds were issued without any legal warrant or authority, and are absolutely void because there was an election held Nov. 7, 1871, whereat it was voted by the qualified electors of said township that it should subscribe $75,000 to the capital stock of the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company, and issue its bonds in payment therefor; that said company, after said election and vote </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 99 U.

Whether or not it is a defense to this action by a <em>bona fide</em> holder of the interest coupons sued on for value and without notice, that the amount of bonds, to-wit, $75,000, issued by the defendant, was in excess of the amounts prescribed by the acts of the Legislature of Kansas approved Feb. 25, 1870, and approved March 2, 1872, in relation to the assessed taxable property of the defendant at the times of voting and issuing said bonds.</p>\n<p>2. Whether or not it is a defense to this action by a <em>bona fide</em> holder for value of the interest coupons sued on without actual notice, that after the order of the board of county commissioners for an election, and after a favorable vote by a three-fifths majority of the qualified electors of Salamanca Township, according to law, to subscribe stock in the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company, payable in negotiable bonds, to aid in the construction of its railroad, the subscription of stock and the issue of bonds without any further election were made to the Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company with which said prior company, in whose favor the vote was had, had become merged and consolidated under a law existing at the time of said election, to form a continuous line.</p>\n<p>The demurrer was overruled, and final judgment rendered for the township.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The first question certified is answered in the negative upon the authority of <em>Marcy v. Township of Oswego,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/637/case.html">92 U. S. 637</a></span>, decided in this Court since the trial below.</p>\n<p>The second question is likewise answered in the negative upon the authority of <em>County of Scotland v. Thomas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/682/case.html">94 U. S. 682</a></span>, also decided here since the trial below.  The power of the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company to consolidate with other companies existed when the vote for subscription was taken in the township.  When the consolidation took place, there was a perfected power in the township to subscribe to the stock of that company, and there was also an existing privilege in the company to receive the subscription.  That privilege, as we held in the <em>Scotland County</em> case, passed by the consolidation to the consolidated company.</p>\n<p>The township trustee and the township clerk who made the subscription and issued the bonds in this case were the officially constituted authorities of the township, and when they subscribed to the stock and issued the bonds, they acted in their official capacity as the legal representatives of the township, and not as mere agents.  In this particular, they occupied the position of the county court in the <em>Scotland County</em> case.  They were to all intents and purposes the township in its corporate capacity.  In <em>Harshman v. Bates County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/569/case.html">92 U. S. 569</a></span>, the case was different.  There, the county court was the mere agent of a corporation, with which it had no official connection.  The difference between the two cases is precisely that between a principal and an agent, and it is so expressly said in the <em>Scotland County</em> case.  In the one case, the corporation is bound if the action of the officers is within their corporate powers, while in the other the action must be within the corporate powers delegated to the agent.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as may appear to be necessary, and it is</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
