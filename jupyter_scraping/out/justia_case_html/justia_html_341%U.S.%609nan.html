JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Basing his complaint on the Illinois wrongful death statute, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] appellant administrator brought this action in the Wisconsin state court to recover damages for the death of Harold Hughes, who was fatally injured in an automobile accident in Illinois.  The allegedly negligent driver and an insurance company were named as defendants.  On their motion, the trial court entered summary judgment "dismissing the complaint on the merits."  It held that a Wisconsin statute, which creates a right of action only for deaths caused in that state, establishes a local public policy against Wisconsin\'s entertaining suits brought under the wrongful death acts of other states. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, notwithstanding the contention that the local statute, so construed, violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 1 of the Constitution. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 341 U. S. 611</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are called upon to decide the narrow question whether Wisconsin, over the objection raised, can close the doors of its courts to the cause of action created by the Illinois wrongful death act. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Prior decisions have established that the Illinois statute is a "public act" within the provision of Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 1 that "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts . . . of every other State." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It is also settled that Wisconsin cannot escape this constitutional obligation to enforce the rights and duties validly created under the laws of other states by the simple device of removing jurisdiction from courts otherwise competent. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We have recognized, however, that full faith and credit does not automatically compel a forum state to subordinate its own statutory policy to a conflicting public act of another state; rather, it is for this Court to choose in each case between the competing public policies involved. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The clash of interests in cases of this type has usually been described as a conflict between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 341 U. S. 612</a></p><p> the public policies of two or more states. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The more basic conflict involved in the present appeal, however, is as follows:  on the one hand is the strong unifying principle embodied in the Full Faith and Credit Clause looking toward maximum enforcement in each state of the obligations or rights created or recognized by the statutes of sister states; [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] on the other hand is the policy of Wisconsin, as interpreted by its highest court, against permitting Wisconsin courts to entertain this wrongful death action. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>We hold that Wisconsin\'s policy must give way.  That state has no real feeling of antagonism against wrongful death suits in general. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  To the contrary, a forum is regularly provided for cases of this nature, the exclusionary rule extending only so far as to bar actions for death not caused locally. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Wisconsin policy, moreover, cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 341 U. S. 613</a></p><p> be considered as an application of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine, whatever effect that doctrine might be given if its use resulted in denying enforcement to public acts of other states.  Even if we assume that Wisconsin could refuse, by reason of particular circumstances, to hear foreign controversies to which nonresidents were parties, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] the present case is not one lacking a close relationship with the state.  For not only were appellant, the decedent, and the individual defendant all residents of Wisconsin, but also appellant was appointed administrator, and the corporate defendant was created under Wisconsin laws.  We also think it relevant, although not crucial here, that Wisconsin may well be the only jurisdiction in which service could be had as an original matter on the insurance company defendant. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  And while in the present case jurisdiction over the individual defendant apparently could be had in Illinois by substituted service, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] in other cases, Wisconsin\'s exclusionary statute might amount to a deprivation of all opportunity to enforce valid death claims created by another state.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude that Wisconsin\'s statutory policy which excludes this Illinois cause of action is forbidden by the national policy of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The judgment is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 341 U. S. 614</a></p><p> reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Smith-Hurd\'s Ill.Ann.Stat. c. 70, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 2.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Wis.Stat., 1949, \xc2\xa7 331.03.

This Court has, with good reason, gone far in requiring that the courts of a State respect judgments entered by courts of other States.  <em>Fauntleroy v. Lum,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/210/230/case.html">210 U. S. 230</a></span>; <em>Kenney v. Supreme Lodge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/411/case.html">252 U. S. 411</a></span>; <em>Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/268/case.html">296 U. S. 268</a></span>; <em>cf. Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/430/case.html">320 U. S. 430</a></span>.  But the extent to which a State must recognize and enforce the rights of action created by other States is not so clear.</p>\n<p>1. In the field of commercial law -- where certainty is of high importance -- we have often imposed a rather rigid rule that a State must defer to the law of the incorporation, or to the law of the place of contract.  Thus, in <em>Broderick v. Rosner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/629/case.html">294 U. S. 629</a></span>, we held that New Jersey could not close its courts to suits which involved stockholder liability arising under the laws of New York.  We had already said, in <em>Converse v. Hamilton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/243/case.html">224 U. S. 243</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/243/case.html#260">224 U. S. 260</a></span>, that such liability was "peculiarly within the regulatory power" of the incorporation; "so much so that no other State properly can be said to have any public policy thereon."  In <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Insurance Co. v. Yates,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/178/case.html">299 U. S. 178</a></span>, we held that the Georgia courts had to give full faith and credit to a New York parole evidence statute which prevented recovery on an insurance contract made in New York.  In both these cases, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis, emphasized that it was the particular relationship involved which made the Full Faith and Credit Clause applicable. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="616">Page 341 U. S. 616</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/201/case.html">314 U. S. 201</a></span>, the Court found that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not require the courts of the forum to enforce, against local policyholders, assessments valid under the laws of the state of incorporation of a mutual insurance company.  In <em>Griffin v. McCoach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/498/case.html">313 U. S. 498</a></span>, we decided that the forum may decline to enforce an insurance policy in favor of beneficiaries who have no insurable interest under local law.  <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Wolfe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/586/case.html">331 U. S. 586</a></span>, seems to have made it clear, however, that these decisions did not represent a radical departure from the earlier cases.  We held in the <em>Wolfe</em> case that the forum was required to give full faith and credit to a law of the state of incorporation allowing a fraternal benefit society to limit the duration of its liability.  It is not merely a bit of rhetoric to caution against imposing on the courts of the forum a "state of vassalage."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/457/case.html">Hawkins v. Barney\'s Lessee,</a></span></em> 5 Pet. 457,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/457/case.html#467">30 U. S. 467</a></span>, quoted in <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Wolfe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/586/case.html#627">331 U. S. 627</a></span>, dissenting opinion.  But this consideration of autonomy is not sufficient to overcome the advantages to be obtained from a degree of certainty in corporate and commercial law.</p>\n<p>2. In cases involving workmen\'s compensation, there is also a preexisting relationship between the employer and employee that makes certainty of result desirable.  The possible interest of the forum in protecting the workman, however, has made this Court reluctant to impose rigid rules.  In <em>Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/145/case.html">286 U. S. 145</a></span>, suit was brought in New Hampshire to recover for the wrongful death of an employee occurring in New Hampshire.  We held, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, that the court sitting in New Hampshire would have to dismiss the action because workmen\'s compensation was an exclusive remedy under the laws of Vermont, where the contract of employment was made, where the employment was usually carried on, and where both the employer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 341 U. S. 617</a></p><p> and the employee were domiciled.  Mr. Justice Stone concurred on the ground that the New Hampshire courts would apply the Vermont law on principles of comity.  He thought the Full Faith and Credit Clause</p>\n<p>"should be interpreted as leaving the courts of New Hampshire free, in the circumstances now presented, either to apply or refuse to apply the law of Vermont, in accordance with their own interpretation of New Hampshire policy and law."</p>\n<p>286 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/145/case.html#164">286 U. S. 164</a></span>-165.</p>\n<p>In <em>Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Acc. Commission,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/532/case.html">294 U. S. 532</a></span>, we held that California -- where the contract of employment was entered into -- was free to apply the terms of its own workmen\'s compensation statute to an employee injured in Alaska, although an Alaska statute purported to give an exclusive remedy to persons injured there.  In <em>Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/493/case.html">306 U. S. 493</a></span>, we held that the California courts need not give full faith and credit to the exclusive remedy provisions of the Massachusetts workmen\'s compensation statute, although Massachusetts was the place of contract and the usual place of employment.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice Stone, who wrote the opinions in the latter two cases, specifically limited the <em>Clapper</em> decision:</p>\n<p>"The <em>Clapper</em> case cannot be said to have decided more than that a state statute applicable to employer and employee within the state, which, by its terms, provides compensation for the employee if he is injured in the course of his employment while temporarily in another state, will be given full faith and credit in the latter when not obnoxious to its policy."</p>\n<p>306 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/493/case.html#504">306 U. S. 504</a></span>.</p>\n<p>3. In the tort action before us, there is little reason to impose a "state of vassalage" on the forum.  The liability here imposed does not rest on a preexisting relationship between the plaintiff and defendant.  There is consequently no need for fixed rules which would enable parties, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 341 U. S. 618</a></p><p> at the time they enter into a transaction, to predict its consequences.</p>\n<p>The Court, in the <em>Clapper</em> case, stressed that New Hampshire had opened its courts to the action, but had refused to recognize a substantive defense.  Indeed, the Court indicated that a State may be free to close its courts to suits based on the tort liability created by the statutes of other States:</p>\n<p>"It is true that the full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right conferred by a statute of another State.  There is room for some play of conflicting policies.  Thus, a plaintiff suing in New Hampshire on a statutory cause of action arising in Vermont might be denied relief because the forum fails to provide a court with jurisdiction of the controversy, <em>see Chambers v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/207/142/case.html">207 U. S. 142</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/207/142/case.html#148">207 U. S. 148</a></span>-149; <em>compare Douglas v. New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/279/377/case.html">279 U. S. 377</a></span>. . . .  A state may, on occasion, decline to enforce a foreign cause of action.  In so doing, it merely denies a remedy, leaving unimpaired the plaintiff\'s substantive right, so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere."</p>\n<p>286 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">286 U. S. 160</span>.</p>\n<p>This Court should certainly not require that the forum deny its own law and follow the tort law of another State where there is a reasonable basis for the forum to close its courts to the foreign cause of action.  The decision of Wisconsin to open its courts to actions for wrongful deaths within the State, but close them to actions for deaths outside the State, may not satisfy everyone\'s notion of wise policy.  <em>See Loucks v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> 224 N.Y. 99, 120 N.E.198 (1918).  But it is neither novel nor without reason.  <em>Compare</em> the similar Illinois statute which was before this Court in <em>Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, supra.</em>  Wisconsin may be willing to grant a right of action where witnesses will be available in Wisconsin, and the courts are acquainted with a detailed local statute and cases construing it.  It may not wish to subject residents to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="619">Page 341 U. S. 619</a></p><p> suit where out-of-state witnesses will be difficult to bring before the court, and where the court will be faced with the alternative of applying a complex foreign statute -- perhaps inconsistent with that of Wisconsin on important issues -- or fitting the statute to the Wisconsin pattern.  The legislature may well feel that it is better to allow the courts of the State where the accident occurred to construe and apply its own statute, and that the exceptional case where the defendant cannot be served in the State where the accident occurred does not warrant a general statute allowing suit in the Wisconsin courts.  The various wrongful death statutes are inconsistent on such issues as beneficiaries, the party who may bring suit, limitations on liability, comparative negligence, and the measure of damages.  <em>See</em> Report of the Special Commission to Study the Method of Assessing Damages in Actions for Death (Mass.Sen. No. 430; Dec. 31, 1942) 21 <em>et seq.;</em> Note, (1950) Wis.L.Rev. 354, 360, 363.  The measure of damages and the relation of wrongful death actions to actions for injury surviving death have raised extremely complicated problems, even for a court applying the familiar statute of its own State.  <em>See</em> Note, 91 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 68 (1942); Oppenheim, The Survival of Tort Actions and the Action for Wrongful Death -- A Survey and a Proposal, 16 Tulane L.Rev. 386 (1942).  These diversities reasonably suggest application by local judges versed in them.  <em>Compare Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/315/case.html">319 U. S. 315</a></span>; <em>Alabama Public Service Comm\'n v. Southern R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html">341 U. S. 341</a></span>.</p>\n<p>No claim is made that Wisconsin has discriminated against the citizens of other States and thus violated Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2 of the Constitution.  <em>Compare Douglas v. New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., supra.</em>  Nor is a claim made that the lack of a forum in Wisconsin deprives the plaintiff of due process.  <em>Compare Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust &amp; Savings Co. v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/673/case.html">281 U. S. 673</a></span>; <em>Missouri v. Lewis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/22/case.html">101 U. S. 22</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/22/case.html#30">101 U. S. 30</a></span>.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 341 U. S. 620</a></p><p> Nor is it argued that Wisconsin is flouting a federal statute.  <em>Compare Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v.

S. 199</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/199/case.html#201">239 U. S. 201</a></span>.  The only question before us is now far the Full Faith and Credit Clause undercuts the purpose of the Constitution, made explicit by the Tenth Amendment, to leave the conduct of domestic affairs to the States.  Few interests are of more dominant local concern than matters governing the administration of law.  This vital interest of the States should not be sacrificed in the interest of a merely literal reading of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</p>\n<p>There is no support, either in reason or in the cases, for holding that this Court is to make a <em>de novo</em> choice between the policies underlying the laws of Wisconsin and Illinois.  I cannot believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause provided a "writer\'s inkhorn" so that this Court might separate right from wrong.</p>\n<p>"<em>Prima facie,</em> every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted.  One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the forum."</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice Stone, in <em>Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/532/case.html#547">294 U. S. 547</a></span>-548.  In the present case, the decedent, the plaintiff, and the individual defendant were residents of Wisconsin.  The corporate defendant was created under Wisconsin law.  The suit was brought in the Wisconsin courts.  No reason is apparent -- and none is vouchsafed in the opinion of the Court -- why the interest of Illinois is so great that it can force the courts of Wisconsin to grant relief in defiance of their own law.</p>\n<p>Finally, it may be noted that there is no conflict here in the policies underlying the statute of Wisconsin and that of Illinois.  The Illinois wrongful death statute has a proviso that</p>\n<p>"no action shall be brought or prosecuted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="621">Page 341 U. S. 621</a></p><p> in this State to recover damages for a death occurring outside of this State where a right of action for such death exists under the laws of the place where such death occurred and service of process in such suit may be had upon the defendant in such place."</p>\n<p>Smith-Hurd\'s Ill.Ann.Stat. c. 70, \xc2\xa7 2.  The opinion of the Court concedes that "jurisdiction over the individual defendant apparently could be had in Illinois by substituted service."  Smith-Hurd\'s Ill.Ann.Stat. c. 95  1/2, \xc2\xa7 23.  Thus, in the converse of the case at bar -- if Hughes had been killed in Wisconsin and suit had been brought in Illinois -- the Illinois courts would apparently have dismissed the suit.  There is no need to be "more Roman than the Romans." <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>* <em>Compare</em> Freund, Chief Justice Stone and the Conflict of Laws, 59 Harv.L.Rev. 1210, 1220 (1946).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
