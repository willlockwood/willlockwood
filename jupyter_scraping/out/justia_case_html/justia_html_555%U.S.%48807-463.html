S. Forest Service approved the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres of fire-damaged federal land, respondent environmentalist organizations filed suit to enjoin the Service from applying its regulations exempting such small sales from the notice, comment, and appeal process it uses for more significant land management decisions, and to challenge other regulations that did not apply to Burnt Ridge.  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the sale, and the parties then settled their dispute as to Burnt Ridge.  Although concluding that the sale was no longer at issue, and despite the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that respondents therefore lacked standing to challenge the regulations, the court nevertheless proceeded to adjudicate the merits of their challenges, invalidating several regulations, including the notice and comment and the appeal provisions.  Among its rulings, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the determination that the latter regulations, which were applicable to Burnt Ridge, were contrary to law, but held that challenges to other regulations not at issue in that project were not ripe for adjudication.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Respondents lack standing to challenge the regulations still at issue absent a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.

The standing doctrine reflects this fundamental limitation, requiring that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\xe2\x80\x99 as to warrant <em>his</em> invocation of federal-court jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U.

S. 727</a>, 734\xe2\x80\x93736, but generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone suffice.  Respondents have identified no application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to their members\xe2\x80\x99 interests.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they have standing based on Burnt Ridge fails because, after voluntarily settling the portion of their lawsuit relevant to Burnt Ridge, respondents and their members are no longer under threat of injury from that project.  The remaining affidavit submitted in support of standing fails to establish that any member has concrete plans to visit a site where the challenged regulations are being applied in a manner that will harm that member\xe2\x80\x99s concrete interests.

(We will refer to them collectively as \xe2\x80\x9cEarth Island.\xe2\x80\x9d)  They seek to prevent the United States Forest Service from enforcing regulations that exempt small fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process used by the Forest Service for more significant land management decisions.  We must determine whether respondents have standing to challenge the regulations in the absence of a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1992, Congress enacted the Forest Service Decisionmaking and Appeals Reform Act (Appeals Reform Act or Act), Pub. L. 102\xe2\x80\x93381, Tit. III, \xc2\xa7322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71612.  Among other things, this required the Forest Service to establish a notice, comment, and appeal process for \xe2\x80\x9cproposed actions of the Forest Service concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans developed under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Forest Service\xe2\x80\x99s regulations implementing the Act provided that certain of its procedures would not be applied to projects that the Service considered categorically excluded from the requirement to file an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA).  36 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7215.4(a) (notice and comment), 215.12(f) (appeal) (2008).  Later amendments to the Forest Service\xe2\x80\x99s manual of implementing procedures, adopted by rule after notice and comment, provided that fire-rehabilitation activities on areas of less than 4,200 acres, and salvage-timber sales of 250 acres or less, did not cause a significant environmental impact and thus would be categorically exempt from the requirement to file an EIS or EA.  68 Fed. Reg. 33824 (2003) (Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, ch. 30, \xc2\xa731.2(11)); 68 Fed. Reg. 44607 (FSH 1909.15, ch. 30, \xc2\xa731.2(13)).  This had the effect of excluding these projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the summer of 2002, fire burned a significant area of the Sequoia National Forest.  In September 2003, the Service issued a decision memo approving the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres damaged by that fire.  Pursuant to its categorical exclusion of salvage sales of less than 250 acres, the Forest Service did not provide notice in a form consistent with the Appeals Reform Act, did not provide a period of public comment, and did not make an appeal process available.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2003, respondents filed a complaint in the Eastern District of California, challenging the failure of the Forest Service to apply to the Burnt Ridge Project \xc2\xa7215.4(a) of its regulations implementing the Appeals Reform Act (requiring prior notice and comment), and \xc2\xa7215.12(f) of the regulations (setting forth an appeal procedure).  The complaint also challenged six other Forest Service regulations implementing the Act that were not applied to the Burnt Ridge Project.  They are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the Burnt Ridge salvage-timber sale.  Soon thereafter, the parties settled their dispute over the Burnt Ridge Project and the District Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Burnt Ridge timber sale is not at issue in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Earth Island</em> <em>Inst.</em> v. <em>Pengilly</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 994, 999 (ED Cal. 2005).  The Government argued that, with the Burnt Ridge dispute settled, and with no other project before the court in which respondents were threatened with injury in fact, respondents lacked standing to challenge the regulations; and that absent a concrete dispute over a particular project a challenge to the regulations would not be ripe.  The District Court proceeded, however, to adjudicate the merits of Earth Island\xe2\x80\x99s challenges.  It invalidated five of the regulations (including \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7215.4(a) and 215.12(f)),<em> id.,</em> at 1011, and entered a nationwide injunction against their application, <em>Earth Island Inst. </em>v. <em>Ruthenbeck</em>, No. CIV F\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x936386 JKS, 2005 WL 5280466 *2 (Sept. 20, 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit held that Earth Island\xe2\x80\x99s challenges to regulations not at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project were not ripe for adjudication because there was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a sufficient \xe2\x80\x98case or controversy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before the court to sustain a facial challenge.  <em>Earth Island Inst. </em>v. <em>Ruthenbeck</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa03d 687, 696 (2007) (amended opinion).  It affirmed, however, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7215.4(a) and 215.12(f), which were applicable to the Burnt Ridge Project, were contrary to law, and upheld the nationwide injunction against their application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government sought review of the question whether Earth Island could challenge the regulations at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project, and if so whether a nationwide injunction was appropriate relief.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In limiting the judicial power to \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies,\xe2\x80\x9d Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law.  Except when necessary in the execution of that function, courts have no charter to review and revise legislative and executive action.  See  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 559\xe2\x80\x93560 (1992); <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 111\xe2\x80\x93112 (1983).  This limitation \xe2\x80\x9cis founded in concern about the proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U. S. 490</a>, 498 (1975).  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/index.html">418 U. S. 166</a>, 179 (1974).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that reflect this fundamental limitation.  It requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff has \xe2\x80\x98alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\xe2\x80\x99 as to warrant <em>his</em> invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  422 U. S., at 498\xe2\x80\x93499.  He bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought.  See <em>Lyons, supra,</em> at 105.  To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury.  <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 180\xe2\x80\x93181 (2000).  This requirement assures that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/208/index.html">418 U. S. 208</a>, 221 (1974).  Where that need does not exist, allowing courts to oversee legislative or executive action \xe2\x80\x9cwould significantly alter the allocation of power \xe2\x80\xa6 away from a democratic form of government,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Richardson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 188 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations under challenge here neither require nor forbid any action on the part of respondents.  The standards and procedures that they prescribe for Forest Service appeals govern only the conduct of Forest Service officials engaged in project planning.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \xe2\x80\x98substantially more difficult\xe2\x80\x99 to establish.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562.  Here, respondents can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations by the Government will affect <em>them </em>in the manner described above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is common ground that the respondent organizations can assert the standing of their members.  To establish the concrete and particularized injury that standing requires, respondents point to their members\xe2\x80\x99 recreational interests in the National Forests.  While generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone support standing, if that harm in fact affects the recreational or even the mere esthetic interests of the plaintiff, that will suffice. <em>Sierra Club</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/727/index.html">405 U. S. 727</a>, 734\xe2\x80\x93736 (1972).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Affidavits submitted to the District Court alleged that organization member Ara Marderosian had repeatedly visited the Burnt Ridge site, that he had imminent plans to do so again, and that his interests in viewing the flora and fauna of the area would be harmed if the Burnt Ridge Project went forward without incorporation of the ideas he would have suggested if the Forest Service had provided him an opportunity to comment.  The Government concedes this was sufficient to establish Article III standing with respect to Burnt Ridge.  Brief for Petitioners 28.  Marderosian\xe2\x80\x99s threatened injury with regard to that project was originally one of the bases for the present suit.  After the District Court had issued a preliminary injunction, however, the parties settled their differences on that score.  Marderosian\xe2\x80\x99s injury in fact with regard to that project has been remedied, and it is, as the District Court pronounced, \xe2\x80\x9cnot at issue in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  376 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 999.  We know of no precedent for the proposition that when a plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of certain action or threatened action but has settled that suit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that action (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from any concrete application that threatens imminent harm to his interests.  Such a holding would fly in the face of Article III\xe2\x80\x99s injury-in-fact requirement.  See <em>Lyons, supra</em>, at 111.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents have identified no other application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to the interests of their members.  The only other affidavit relied on was that of Jim Bensman.*<footcall num="*">  He asserted, first, that he had suffered injury in the past from development on Forest Service land.  That does not suffice for several reasons: because it was not tied to application of the challenged regulations, because it does not identify any particular site, and because it relates to past injury rather than imminent future injury that is sought to be enjoined.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bensman\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit further asserts that he has visited many National Forests and plans to visit several unnamed National Forests in the future.  Respondents describe this as a mere failure to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the name of each timber sale that affected [Bensman\xe2\x80\x99s] interests,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 44.  It is much more (or much less) than that.  It is a failure to allege that <em>any</em> particular timber sale or other project claimed to be unlawfully subject to the regulations will impede a specific and concrete plan of Bensman\xe2\x80\x99s to enjoy the National Forests.  The National Forests occupy more than 190 million acres, an area larger than Texas.  See Meet the Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/aboutus/\nmeetfs.shtml (as visited Feb. 27, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  There may be a chance, but is hardly a likelihood, that Bensman\xe2\x80\x99s wanderings will bring him to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the regulations.  Indeed, without further specification it is impossible to tell <em>which </em>projects are (in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view) unlawfully subject to the regulations.  The allegations here present a weaker likelihood of concrete harm than that which we found insufficient in <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, where a plaintiff who alleged that he had been injured by an improper police chokehold sought injunctive relief barring use of the hold in the future.  We said it was \xe2\x80\x9cno more than conjecture\xe2\x80\x9d that Lyons would be subjected to that chokehold upon a later encounter.  <em>Id.,</em> at 108<em>.</em>  Here we are asked to assume not only that Bensman will stumble across a project tract unlawfully subject to the regulations, but also that the tract is about to be developed by the Forest Service in a way that harms his recreational interests, and that he would have commented on the project but for the regulation.  Accepting an intention to visit the National Forests as adequate to confer standing to challenge any Government action affecting any portion of those forests would be tantamount to eliminating the requirement of concrete, particularized injury in fact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bensman affidavit does refer specifically to a series of projects in the Allegheny National Forest that are subject to the challenged regulations.  It does not assert, however, any firm intention to visit their locations, saying only that Bensman \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98want[s] to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d go there.  Brief for Petitioners 6.  This vague desire to return is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of imminent injury: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch \xe2\x80\x98some day\xe2\x80\x99 intentions\xe2\x80\x94without any description of concrete plans, or indeed any specification of <em>when </em>the some day will be\xe2\x80\x94do not support a finding of the \xe2\x80\x98actual or imminent\xe2\x80\x99 injury that our cases require.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U. S., at 564.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that they have standing to bring their challenge because they have suffered procedural injury, namely that they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so denied.  But deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation\xe2\x80\x94a procedural right <em>in vacuo</em>\xe2\x80\x94is insufficient to create Article III standing.  Only a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who has been accorded a procedural right to protect <em>his concrete interests</em> can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 572, n. 7 (emphasis added).  Respondents alleged such injury in their challenge to the Burnt Ridge Project, claiming that but for the allegedly unlawful abridged procedures they would have been able to oppose the project that threatened to impinge on their concrete plans to observe nature in that specific area.  But Burnt Ridge is now off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It makes no difference that the procedural right has been accorded by Congress.  That can loosen the strictures of the redressability prong of our standing inquiry\xe2\x80\x94so that standing existed with regard to the Burnt Ridge Project, for example, despite the possibility that Earth Island\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly guaranteed right to comment would not be successful in persuading the Forest Service to avoid impairment of Earth Island\xe2\x80\x99s concrete interests.  See <em>Ibid.</em>  Unlike redressability, however, the requirement of injury in fact is a hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that cannot be removed by statute.</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would exceed [Article III\xe2\x80\x99s] limitations if, at the behest of Congress and in the absence of any showing of concrete injury, we were to entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public\xe2\x80\x99s nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws. \xe2\x80\xa6 [T]he party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent proposes a hitherto unheard-of test for organizational standing: whether, accepting the organization\xe2\x80\x99s self-description of the activities of its members, there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury.  Since, for example, the Sierra Club asserts in its pleadings that it has more than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of members in California\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.), it is probable (according to the dissent) that some (unidentified) members have planned to visit some (unidentified) small parcels affected by the Forest Service\xe2\x80\x99s procedures and will suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.  This novel approach to the law of organizational standing would make a mockery of our prior cases, which have required plaintiff-organizations to make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.  In <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 563, we held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to \xe2\x80\x9csubmit affidavits \xe2\x80\xa6 showing, through specific facts \xe2\x80\xa6 that one or more of [its] members would \xe2\x80\xa6 be \xe2\x80\x98directly\xe2\x80\x99 affected\xe2\x80\x9d by the allegedly illegal activity.  <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/727/index.html">405 U. S. 727</a>, involved the same Sierra Club that is a party in the present case, and a project in the Sequoia National Forest.  The principal difference from the present case is that the challenged project was truly massive, involving the construction of motels, restaurants, swimming pools, parking lots, and other structures on 80 acres of the Forest, plus ski lifts, ski trails, and a 20-mile access highway.  We did not engage in an assessment of statistical probabilities that one of the Sierra Club\xe2\x80\x99s members would be adversely affected, but held that the Sierra Club lacked standing.  We said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sierra Club failed to allege that it or its members would be affected in any of their activities or pastimes by the Disney development.  Nowhere in the pleadings or affidavits did the Club state that its members use Mineral King for any purpose, much less that they use it in any way that would be significantly affected by the proposed actions of the respondents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 735.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd in <em>FW/PBS, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dallas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/215/index.html">493 U. S. 215</a>, 235 (1990), we noted that the affidavit provided by the city to establish standing would be insufficient because it did not name the individuals who were harmed by the challenged license-revocation program.  This requirement of naming the affected members has never been dispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where <em>all </em>the members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Patterson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/index.html">357 U. S. 449</a>, 459 (1958) (all organization members affected by release of membership lists).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A major problem with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach is that it accepts the organizations\xe2\x80\x99 self-descriptions of their membership, on the simple ground that \xe2\x80\x9cno one denies\xe2\x80\x9d them, <em>post</em>, at 6.  But it is well established that the court has an independent obligation to assure that standing exists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties.  <em>Bender</em> v. <em>Williamsport Area School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/534/index.html">475 U. S. 534</a>, 541 (1986).  Without individual affidavits, how is the court to assure itself that the Sierra Club, for example, has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98thousands of members\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d?  And, because to establish standing plaintiffs must show that they \xe2\x80\x9cuse the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly in the vicinity of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a project site, <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U. S., at 566 (internal quotation marks omitted), how is the court to assure itself that some of these members plan to make use of the specific sites upon which projects may take place?  Or that these same individuals will find their recreation burdened by the Forest Service\xe2\x80\x99s use of the challenged procedures?  While it is certainly possible\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even likely\xe2\x80\x94that one individual will meet all of these criteria, that speculation does not suffice.  \xe2\x80\x9cStanding,\xe2\x80\x9d we have said, \xe2\x80\x9cis not \xe2\x80\x98an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 [but] requires \xe2\x80\xa6 a factual showing of perceptible harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In part because of the difficulty of verifying the facts upon which such probabilistic standing depends, the Court has required plaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to identify members who have suffered the requisite harm\xe2\x80\x94surely not a difficult task here, when so many thousands are alleged to have been harmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent would have us replace the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98imminent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d harm, which it acknowledges our cases establish, see <em>post</em>, at 4, with the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a <em>realistic</em> threat\xe2\x80\x99 that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause [the plaintiff] harm \xe2\x80\x98in the reasonably near future,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 5.  That language is taken, of course, from an opinion that did <em>not </em>find standing, so the seeming expansiveness of the test made not a bit of difference.  The problem for the dissent is that the timely affidavits no more meet that requirement than they meet the usual formulation.  They fail to establish that the affiants\xe2\x80\x99 members will <em>ever</em> visit one of the small parcels at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent insists, however, that we should also have considered the late-filed affidavits.  It invokes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d) (West 2008 rev. ed.), which says that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating of a claim or defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  So also does Rule 21 permit joinder of parties \xe2\x80\x9cat any time.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the latter no more permits joinder of parties, than the former permits the supplementation of the record, in the circumstances here: <em>after the trial is over, judgment has been entered, and a notice of appeal has been filed.  </em>The dissent cites no instance in which \xe2\x80\x9csupplementation\xe2\x80\x9d has been permitted to resurrect and alter the outcome in a case that has gone to judgment, and indeed after notice of appeal had been filed.  If Rule 15(b) allows additional facts to be inserted into the record after appeal has been filed, we are at the threshold of a brave new world of trial practice in which Rule 60 has been swallowed whole by Rule 15(b).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since we have resolved this case on the ground of standing, we need not reach the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the regulations are ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It holds that the dispute between the five environmental groups and the Forest Service consists simply of an abstract challenge; it does not amount to the concrete \xe2\x80\x9cCas[e]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControvers[y]\xe2\x80\x9d that the Constitution grants federal courts the power to resolve.

I cannot agree that this is so.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand the <em>constitutional </em>issue that the majority decides, it may prove helpful to imagine that Congress enacted a <em>statutory </em>provision that expressly permitted environmental groups like the respondents here to bring cases just like the present one, provided (1) that the group has members who have used salvage-timber parcels in the past and are likely to do so in the future, and (2) that the group\xe2\x80\x99s members have opposed Forest Service timber sales in the past (using notice, comment, and appeal procedures to do so) and will likely use those procedures to oppose salvage-timber sales in the future.  The majority cannot, and does not, claim that such a statute would be unconstitutional.  See <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/497/index.html">549 U. S. 497</a>, 516\xe2\x80\x93518 (2007); <em>Sierra Club</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/727/index.html">405 U.

How then can it find the present case constitutionally unauthorized?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I believe the majority answers this question as follows: It recognizes, as this Court has held, that a plaintiff has constitutional standing if the plaintiff demonstrates (1) an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98injury in fact,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (2) that is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable\xe2\x80\x9d to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged action,\xe2\x80\x9d and which (3) a \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable [judicial] decision\xe2\x80\x9d will likely prevent or redress.  <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 180\xe2\x80\x93181 (2000).  The majority does not deny that the plaintiffs meet the latter two requirements.  It focuses only upon the first, the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cactual,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural or hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d injury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 180.  In doing so, it properly agrees that the \xe2\x80\x9corganizations\xe2\x80\x9d here can \xe2\x80\x9cassert the standing of their members.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  It points out that injuries to the \xe2\x80\x9cmembers\xe2\x80\x99 recreational\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9cmere esthetic interests . . . will suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It does not claim that the <em>procedural</em> nature of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim makes the difference here, for it says only that \xe2\x80\x9cdeprivation of a procedural right <em>without some concrete interest</em>\xe2\x80\x9d thereby affected, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ca procedural right <em>in vacuo\xe2\x80\x9d </em>would prove \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient to create Article III standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (emphasis added); see also <em>EPA</em>, 549 U. S., at 517\xe2\x80\x93518.  The majority assumes, as do I, that these unlawful Forest Service procedures will lead to substantive actions, namely the sales of salvage timber on burned lands, that might not take place if the proper procedures were followed.  But the majority then finds that the plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that these salvage-timber sales cause plaintiffs an actual injury, that is, harm to the recreational, aesthetic, or other environmental interests of organization members.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  To put the matter in terms of my hypothetical statute, the majority holds that the plaintiff organizations, while showing that they have members who have used salvage-timber sale parcels in the past (<em>i.e.</em>, parcels that the Service does not subject to the notice, comment, and appeal procedures required by law), have failed to show that they have members likely to use such parcels in the future.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How can the majority credibly claim that salvage-timber sales, and similar projects, are unlikely to harm the asserted interests of the members of these environmental groups?  The majority apparently does so in part by arguing that the Forest Service actions are not \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a requirement more appropriately considered in the context of ripeness or the necessity of injunctive relief.  See <em>Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Sierra Club</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/726/index.html">523 U. S. 726</a>, 734 (1998).  I concede that the Court has sometimes used the word \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of constitutional standing.  But it has done so primarily to emphasize that the harm in question\xe2\x80\x94the harm that was not \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was merely \xe2\x80\x9cconjectural\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise speculative.  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560 (1992).  Where the Court has directly focused upon the matter, <em>i.e.</em>, where, as here, a plaintiff has <em>already </em>been subject to the injury it wishes to challenge, the Court has asked whether there is a <em>realistic likelihood</em> that the challenged future conduct will, in fact, recur and harm the plaintiff.  That is what the Court said in <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a> (1983), a case involving a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to enjoin police use of chokeholds.  The Court wrote that the plaintiff, who had been subject to the unlawful chokehold in the past, would have had standing had he shown \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>realistic </em>threat\xe2\x80\x9d that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause him harm \xe2\x80\x9cin the reasonably near future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 107, n.\xc2\xa07, 108 (emphasis added).  Precedent nowhere suggests that the \xe2\x80\x9crealistic threat\xe2\x80\x9d standard contains identification requirements more stringent than the word \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d implies.  See <em>Blum</em> v. <em>Yaretsky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/991/index.html">457 U. S. 991</a>, 1000 (1982).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How could the Court impose a stricter criterion?  Would courts deny <em>standing </em>to a holder of a future interest in property who complains that a life tenant\xe2\x80\x99s waste of the land will almost inevitably hurt the value of his interest\xe2\x80\x94though he will have no personal interest for several years into the future?  Would courts deny <em>standing</em> to a landowner who complains that a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s upstream dam constitutes a nuisance\xe2\x80\x94even if the harm to his downstream property (while bound to occur) will not occur for several years?  Would courts deny <em>standing </em>to an injured person seeking a protection order from future realistic (but nongeographically specific) threats of further attacks? </p>\n<p>\n\n     To the contrary, a threat of future harm may be realistic even where the plaintiff cannot specify precise times, dates, and GPS coordinates.  Thus, we recently held that Massachusetts has <em>standing </em>to complain of a procedural failing, namely, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s failure properly to determine whether to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, even though that failing would create Massachusetts-based harm which (though likely to occur) might not occur for several decades.  <em>EPA</em>, 549 U. S., at 522\xe2\x80\x93523.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Forest Service admits that it intends to conduct thousands of further salvage-timber sales and other projects exempted under the challenged regulations \xe2\x80\x9cin the reasonably near future.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Motion to Clarify and Amend Judgment in No. CIV\xe2\x80\x93F\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x936386\xe2\x80\x93JKS\xe2\x80\x93DLB (ED Cal.), pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.  How then can the Court deny that the plaintiffs have shown a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d threat that the Forest Service will continue to authorize (without the procedures claimed necessary) salvage-timber sales, and other Forest Service projects, that adversely affect the recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 members?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider: Respondents allege, and the Government\nhas conceded, that the Forest Service took wrongful actions (such as selling salvage timber) \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of times in the two years prior to suit.  <em>Id.</em>, at\xc2\xa06; see also <em>id.</em>, Exh. 2, Decl. of Gloria Manning, Associate Deputy Chief for National Forest System \xc2\xb66, p.\xc2\xa03 (identifying 3,377 \xe2\x80\x9cproposed decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s of July 1, 2005,\xe2\x80\x9d that would be excluded from notice, comment, and appeal procedures).  The Complaint alleges, and no one denies, that the organizations, the Sierra Club for example, have hundreds of thousands of members who use forests regularly across the Nation for recreational, scientific, aesthetic, and environmental purposes.  Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb68\xe2\x80\x9312, App. 31\xe2\x80\x9334.  The Complaint further alleges, and no one denies, that these organizations (and their members), believing that actions such as salvage-timber sales harm those interests, regularly oppose salvage-timber sales (and similar actions) in proceedings before the agency.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And the Complaint alleges, and no one denies, that the organizations intend to continue to express their opposition to such actions in those proceedings in the future.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider further: The affidavit of a member of Sequoia ForestKeeper, Ara Marderosian, attached to the Complaint, specifies that Marderosian had visited the Burnt Ridge Project site in the past and intended to return.  The majority concedes that this is sufficient to show that Marderosian had standing to challenge the Burnt Ridge Project. The majority must therefore agree that \xe2\x80\x9cat least one identified member ha[s] suffered \xe2\x80\xa6 harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9. Why then does it find insufficient the affidavit, also attached to the Complaint, of Jim Bensman, a member of Heartwood, Inc.? That affidavit states, among other things, that Bensman has visited 70 National Forests, that he has visited some of those forests \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of times,\xe2\x80\x9d that he has often visited the Allegheny National Forest in the past, that he has \xe2\x80\x9cprobably commented on a thousand\xe2\x80\x9d Forest Service projects including salvage-timber sale proposals, that he intends to continue to comment on similar Forest Service proposals, and that the Forest Service plans in the future to conduct salvage-timber sales on 20 parcels in the Allegheny National Forest\xe2\x80\x94one of the forests he has visited in the past.  \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb66, 13, App. E to Pet. for Cert. 68a, 69a, 71a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Bensman affidavit does not say <em>which particular </em>sites will be affected by future Forest Service projects, but the Service itself has conceded that it will conduct thousands of exempted projects in the future.  Why is more specificity needed to show a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d threat that a project will impact land Bensman uses?  To know, virtually for certain, that snow will fall in New England this winter is not to know the name of each particular town where it is bound to arrive.  The law of standing does not require the latter kind of specificity.  How could it?  And <em>Sierra Club</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/727/index.html">405 U. S. 727</a>, on which the majority so heavily relies, involved plaintiffs who challenged (true, a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive\xe2\x80\x9d) development, but only on a single<em> </em>previously determined site, about 80 acres in size, in a portion of the forest with a \xe2\x80\x9climited . . . number of visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 728.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to infer harm to the Sierra Club\xe2\x80\x99s members there does not demand a similar unwillingness here, where the challenge is to procedures affecting \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of sites, involving hundreds of times as much acreage, where the precise location of each may not yet be known.  In <em>Sierra Club</em>, <em>ibid.</em>, it may have been unreasonable simply to assume that members would suffer an \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  But here, given the very different factual circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe they would not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever doubt may remain is settled by the affidavits the plaintiffs submitted after the Burnt Ridge dispute was settled (while the other claims in the Complaint remained alive).  The majority says it will not consider those affidavits because they were submitted \xe2\x80\x9c[a]fter the District Court had entered judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, n.  But the plaintiffs submitted the affidavits after judgment (in opposition to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a stay) because the Burnt Ridge dispute on which they had relied to show standing at the outset of suit had by that point been settled.  No longer wishing to rely solely on evidence of their members\xe2\x80\x99 interest in that particular project, the plaintiff organizations submitted several other affidavits.  Why describe this perfectly sensible response to the settlement of some of the Complaint\xe2\x80\x99s claims as a \xe2\x80\x9cretroactiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cme[e]t the challenge to their standing at the time of judgment\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ibid.</em>  In fact, the Government did not challenge standing until that point, so of course respondents (who all agree had standing at the outset) did not respond with affidavits until later\xe2\x80\x94when their standing was challenged. This can hardly be characterized as an attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cresurrect and alter the outcome\xe2\x80\x9d in the case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  Regardless, the Constitution does not bar the filing of further affidavits, nor does any statute.  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain no such bar.  Indeed, those Rules provide a judge with liberal discretion to permit a plaintiff to amend a complaint\xe2\x80\x94even after one dispute (of several) is settled.  So why would they not permit the filing of affidavits\xe2\x80\x94at least with the judge\xe2\x80\x99s permission?  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The affidavits in question describe a number of then-pending Forest Service projects, all excluded from notice, comment, and appeal under the Forest Service regulations and all scheduled to take place on parcels that the plaintiff organizations\xe2\x80\x99 members use.  Erik Ryberg, for example, a member of the Center for Biological Diversity, described in his affidavit a proposed logging project scheduled for the Payette National Forest\xe2\x80\x94an area with which he is \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally familiar.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xb66, App. 90.  A second affidavit filed by Jim Bensman described a salvage-timber sale scheduled for the Hoosier National Forest\xe2\x80\x94an area Bensman had visited \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple times\xe2\x80\x9d and to which he planned to return in the coming weeks\xe2\x80\x94and one planned for the Daniel Boone National Forest\xe2\x80\x94also used by Bensman\xe2\x80\x94which would \xe2\x80\x9cimpact [Heartwood\xe2\x80\x99s] members[\xe2\x80\x99] use of the areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb68\xe2\x80\x939, <em>id.</em>, at 85\xe2\x80\x9386.  The affidavits also describe, among other things, the frequency with which the organizations\xe2\x80\x99 members routinely file administrative appeals of salvage-timber sales and identify a number of proposed and pending projects that certain Sierra Club members wished to appeal.  See Decl. of Ren\xc3\xa9 Voss \xc2\xb63, <em>id.</em>, at 94 (describing a proposed logging and prescribed burn planned for the Gallatin National Forest); Decl. of Craig Thomas \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63, 13, <em>id.</em>, at 95, 98 (describing Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cSierra Nevada national forests for recreational, aesthetic, scientific and professional pursuits,\xe2\x80\x9d and attesting to \xe2\x80\x9ceighteen separate logging projects,\xe2\x80\x9d all categorically excluded, proposed for one such forest tract).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These allegations and affidavits more than adequately show a \xe2\x80\x9crealistic threat\xe2\x80\x9d of injury to plaintiffs brought about by reoccurrence of the challenged conduct\xe2\x80\x94conduct that the Forest Service thinks lawful and <em>admits </em>will reoccur.  Many years ago the Ninth Circuit warned that a court should not \xe2\x80\x9cbe blind to what must be necessarily known to every intelligent person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Wo Lee</em>, 26 F. 471, 475 (1886).
