S. 155</a></span>), the case was submitted.</p>\n<p>STORY, J. delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case cannot be distinguished from that of the <em>Rapid.</em>  It was there decided that property engaged in an illicit intercourse with the enemy is liable to confiscation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 12 U. S. 384</a></p><p> as prize of war, and the only remaining question now before us is to whom it shall be condemned -- to the captors or to the United States.</p>\n<p>By the general law of prize, property engaged in an illegal intercourse with the enemy is deemed enemy property.  It is of no consequence whether it belong to an ally or to a citizen; the illegal traffic stamps it with the hostile character and attaches to it all the penal consequences of enemy ownership.  In conformity with this rule, it has been solemnly adjudged by the same course of decisions which has established the illegality of the intercourse that the property engaged therein must be condemned as prize to the captors, and not to the Crown.  This principle has been fully recognized by Sir William Scott in <em>The Nelly,</em> 1 Rob. 219, and indeed seems never to have admitted a serious doubt.</p>\n<p>But a claim is interposed by the United States, claiming a priority of right to the property in question, upon the ground of an antecedent forfeiture to the United States by a violation of the Nonintercourse Act of March 1, 1809, vol. 9, 246, \xc2\xa7 5, the goods having been put on board at a British port with an intent to import the same into the United States.</p>\n<p>We are all of opinion that this claim ought not to prevail.  The municipal forfeiture under the nonintercourse act was absorbed in the more general operation of the law of war.  The property of an enemy seems hardly to be within the purview of mere municipal regulations, but is confiscable under the <em>jus gentium.</em></p>\n<p>But even if the doctrine were otherwise, which we do not admit, we are all satisfied that the Prize Act of 26 June, 1812, ch. 107, operates as a grant from the United States of all property rightfully captured by commissioned privateers as prize of war.  The language of the 4th, 6th and 14th sections is decisive.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the circuit court condemning the vessel and cargo to the captors is affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
