S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71146(a), which provides a tax-stamp exemption for any asset transfer \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed under section 1129.\xe2\x80\x9d  After the sale, Piccadilly filed its Chapter 11 plan, but before the plan could be confirmed, petitioner Florida Department of Revenue (Florida) objected, arguing that the stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of the transferred assets fell outside \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption because the transfer had not been under a confirmed plan.  The court granted Piccadilly summary judgment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption applies to preconfirmation transfers necessary to the consummation of a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, provided there is some nexus between such transfers and the plan; that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text was ambiguous and should be interpreted consistent with the principle that a remedial statute should be construed liberally; and that this interpretation better accounted for the practicalities of Chapter 11 cases because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse a proposed plan\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because \xc2\xa71146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed, Piccadilly may not rely on that provision to avoid Florida\xe2\x80\x99s stamp taxes.  The most natural reading of \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s placement within the Bankruptcy Code, and applicable canons of statutory construction lead to this conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Florida\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71146(a) is the most natural.  Contending that the text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan, Florida argues that \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d denotes a plan confirmed in the past, and that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cwith the authorization of\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinferior or subordinate\xe2\x80\x9d to its referent, here the confirmed plan, see <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 135.  Piccadilly counters that the provision does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement, contending that had Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan,\xe2\x80\x9d it would have used that language, and that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is as easily read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with.\xe2\x80\x9d  While both sides present credible interpretations, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s is the better one.  Congress could have used more precise language and thus removed all ambiguity, but the two readings are not equally plausible.  Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation places greater strain on the statutory text than Florida\xe2\x80\x99s simpler construction.  And Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan\xe2\x80\x9d is unavailing because \xc2\xa71146(a) specifies not only that a transfer be \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d but also that the plan be confirmed pursuant to \xc2\xa71129.  Ultimately this Court need not decide whether \xc2\xa71146(a) is unambiguous on its face, for, based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 other arguments, any ambiguity must be resolved in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even on the assumption that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text is ambiguous, reading it in context with other relevant Code provisions reveals nothing justifying Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s claims that had Congress intended \xc2\xa71146(a) to apply exclusively to postconfirmation transfers, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation, and that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d should be construed broadly to mean in \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with.\xe2\x80\x9d  If statutory context suggests anything, it is that \xc2\xa71146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers.  The provision\xe2\x80\x99s placement in a subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\xe2\x80\x9d undermines Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s view that it extends to preconfirmation transfers.  Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s textual and contextual arguments, even if fully accepted, would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous, not that the purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s favor.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71146(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Respondent Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., was granted an exemption for assets transferred after it had filed for bankruptcy but before its Chapter 11 plan was submitted to, and confirmed by, the Bankruptcy Court.  Petitioner, the Florida Department of Revenue, seeks reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the exemption for Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s asset transfer.  Because we hold that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s stamp-tax exemption does not apply to transfers made before a plan is confirmed under Chapter 11, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly was founded in 1944 and was one of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s most successful cafeteria chains until it began experiencing financial difficulties in the last decade.  On October 29, 2003, Piccadilly declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), and requested court authorization to sell substantially all its assets outside the ordinary course of business pursuant to \xc2\xa7363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Piccadilly prepared to sell its assets as a going concern and sought an exemption from any stamp taxes on the eventual transfer under \xc2\xa71146(a) of the Code.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Bankruptcy Court conducted an auction in which the winning bidder agreed to purchase Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s assets for $80\nmillion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 26, 2004, as a precondition to the sale, Piccadilly entered into a global settlement agreement with committees of senior secured noteholders and unsecured creditors.  The settlement agreement dictated the priority of distribution of the sale proceeds among Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s creditors.  On February 13, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved the proposed sale and settlement agreement.  The court also ruled that the transfer of assets was exempt from stamp taxes under \xc2\xa71146(a).  The sale closed on March 16, 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly filed its initial Chapter 11 plan in the Bankruptcy Court on March 26, 2004, and filed an amended plan on July 31, 2004.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The plan provided for distribution of the sale proceeds in a manner consistent with the settlement agreement.  Before the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan, Florida filed an objection, seeking a declaration that the $39,200 in stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s transferred assets fell outside \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption because the transfer had not been \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d under Chapter 11.  On October 21, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan.  On cross-motions for summary judgment on the stamp-tax issue, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of Piccadilly, reasoning that the sale of substantially all Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s assets was a transfer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98under\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d its confirmed plan because the sale was necessary to consummate the plan.  App. D to Pet. for Cert. 40a\xe2\x80\x9341a.  The District Court upheld the decision on the ground that \xc2\xa71146(a), in certain circumstances, affords a stamp-tax exemption even when a transfer occurs prior to confirmation.  <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</em>, 379 B.\xc2\xa0R. 215, 226 (SD Fla. 2006).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71146[(a)]\xe2\x80\x99s tax exemption may apply to <em>those</em> pre-confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization, which, at the very least, requires that there be some nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</em>, 484 F.\xc2\xa03d 1299, 1304 (2007) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Finding the statutory text ambiguous, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa71146(a) should be interpreted consistent with \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle that a remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court further noted that its interpretation of \xc2\xa71146(a) better accounted for \xe2\x80\x9cthe practical realities of Chapter 11 reorganization cases\xe2\x80\x9d because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse the proposed confirmation of a plan.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding conflicted with the approach taken by the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, <em>id</em>., at 1302, which have held that \xc2\xa71146(a) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply to \xe2\x80\xa6 transactions that occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re</em> <em>Hechinger Inv.

Florida asserts that \xc2\xa71146(a) applies only to postconfirmation sales; Piccadilly contends that it extends to preconfirmation transfers as long as they are made in accordance with a plan that is eventually confirmed.  Florida and Piccadilly base their competing readings of \xc2\xa71146(a) on the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text, on inferences drawn from other Code provisions, and on substantive canons of statutory construction.  We consider each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida contends that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan.  It observes that the word \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d modifies the word \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d and is a past participle, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] verb form indicating past or completed action or time that is used as a verbal adjective in phrases such as <em>baked beans</em> and <em>finished work.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  American Heritage Dictionary 1287<font b="1"> (4th ed. 2000).  Florida maintains that a past participle indicates past or completed action even when it is placed after the noun it modifies, as in \xe2\x80\x9cbeans baked in the oven,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwork finished after midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, it argues, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d denotes a \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning one that has been confirmed in the past.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida further contends that the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cwith the authorization of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinferior or subordinate\xe2\x80\x9d to its referent, here the confirmed plan.  See <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 135 (1991) (noting that a thing that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98under\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a statute is most naturally read as being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subject to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98governed by\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the statute).  Florida points out that, in the other two appearances of \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71146(a), it clearly means \xe2\x80\x9csubject to.\xe2\x80\x9d  Invoking the textual canon that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Commissioner</em> v. <em>Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/152/index.html">508 U. S. 152</a>, 159 (1993), Florida asserts the term must also have its core meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csubject to\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida thus reasons that to be eligible for \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption, a transfer must be subject to a plan that has been confirmed subject to \xc2\xa71129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  Echoing the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in<em> NVR,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 457, Florida concludes that a transfer made prior to the date of plan confirmation cannot be subject to, or under the authority of, something that did not exist at the time of the transfer\xe2\x80\x94a confirmed plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly counters that the statutory language does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement.  It contends that \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily the equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan,\xe2\x80\x9d and that had Congress intended the latter, it would have used that language, as it did in a related Code provision.  See \xc2\xa71142(b) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cany instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan\xe2\x80\x9d).  Piccadilly also argues that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is just as easily read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with.\xe2\x80\x9d  It observes that the variability of the term \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is well-documented, noting that the American Heritage Dictionary 1395 (1976) provides 15 definitions, including \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cby virtue of,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to the restraint \xe2\x80\xa6 of.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also <em>Ardestani</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 135 (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98under\xe2\x80\x99 has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context\xe2\x80\x9d). Although \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d appears several times in \xc2\xa71146(a), Piccadilly maintains there is no reason why a term of such common usage and variable meaning must have the same meaning each time it is used, even in the same sentence.  As an illustration, it points to \xc2\xa7302(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Piccadilly contends that this provision is best read as: \xe2\x80\x9cThe commencement of a joint case <em>subject to the provisions of</em> a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief <em>in</em> such chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Piccadilly thus concludes that the statutory text\xe2\x80\x94standing alone\xe2\x80\x94is susceptible of more than one interpretation.  See <em>Hechinger</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot say that the language of [\xc2\xa71146(a)] rules out the possibility that \xe2\x80\x98under a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x99 means \xe2\x80\x98in agreement with a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While both sides present credible interpretations of \xc2\xa71146(a), Florida has the better one.  To be sure, Congress could have used more precise language\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan <em>that has been</em> confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thus removed all ambiguity.  But the two readings of the language that Congress chose are not equally plausible: Of the two, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s is clearly the more natural.  The interpretation advanced by Piccadilly and adopted by the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x94that there must be \xe2\x80\x9csome nexus between the pre-confirmation transfer and the confirmed plan\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa71146(a) to apply, 484 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1304\xe2\x80\x94places greater strain on the statutory text than the simpler construction advanced by Florida and adopted by the Third and Fourth Circuits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan\xe2\x80\x9d is unavailing because \xc2\xa71146(a) specifies not only that a tax-exempt transfer be \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d but also that the plan in question be confirmed pursuant to \xc2\xa71129.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 placement of \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1129\xe2\x80\x9d avoids the ambiguity that would have arisen had it used the term \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed plan,\xe2\x80\x9d which could easily be read to mean that the transfer must be \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1129\xe2\x80\x9d rather than under a plan that was itself confirmed under \xc2\xa71129.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we agree with Florida that the more natural reading of \xc2\xa71146(a) is that the exemption applies only to postconfirmation transfers, ultimately we need not decide whether the statute is unambiguous on its face.  Even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the language of \xc2\xa71146(a) is facially ambiguous, the ambiguity must be resolved in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  We reach this conclusion after considering the parties\xe2\x80\x99 other arguments, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly insists that, whatever the degree of ambiguity on its face, \xc2\xa71146(a) becomes even more ambiguous when read in context with other Bankruptcy Code provisions.  Piccadilly asserts that if Congress had intended \xc2\xa71146(a) to apply exclusively to transfers occurring after confirmation, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation similar to those appearing elsewhere in the Code.  For example, \xc2\xa71127 governs modifications to a Chapter 11 plan, providing that the proponent of a plan may modify the plan \xe2\x80\x9cat any time before confirmation,\xe2\x80\x9d or, subject to certain restrictions, \xe2\x80\x9cat any time after confirmation of such plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71127(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Similar examples abound.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa71104(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71104(c) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]t any time before the confirmation of a plan \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Piccadilly emphasizes that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because Congress did not impose a clear and commonly used temporal limitation in \xc2\xa71146(a), Piccadilly concludes that Congress did not intend one to exist.  Piccadilly buttresses its conclusion by pointing out that \xc2\xa71146(b)\xe2\x80\x94the subsection immediately following \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x94includes an express temporal limitation.  See \xc2\xa71146(b) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (providing that a bankruptcy court may declare certain tax consequences after the date a government unit responds to a plan proponent\xe2\x80\x99s request or \xe2\x80\x9c270 days after such request,\xe2\x80\x9d whichever is earlier).  But Congress included no such limitation in subsection (a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly also relies on other Code provisions to bolster its argument that the term \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d preceding \xe2\x80\x9ca plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71146(a) should be read broadly\xe2\x80\x94to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d rather than the narrower \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apart from \xc2\xa7302, discussed above, Piccadilly adverts to \xc2\xa7111, which states that an agency providing credit counseling to debtors is required to meet \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards set forth under<em> </em>this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7111(b)(4)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  Piccadilly argues that this language requires the agency to meet \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards set forth <em>in </em>this section,\xe2\x80\x9d because reading the quoted language to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards set forth <em>authorized by </em>this section\xe2\x80\x9d would render the words \xe2\x80\x9cset forth\xe2\x80\x9d nonsensical.  Piccadilly additionally refers to \xc2\xa7303(a), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  Again, Piccadilly asserts that this language means \xe2\x80\x9can involuntary case may be commenced only <em>in </em>chapter 7 or 11 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  It reasons that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7303(a) cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by\xe2\x80\x9d because \xc2\xa7303(a) itself authorizes involuntary cases, and the provisions of Chapters 7 and 11 do not.  Piccadilly makes a similar argument with respect to \xc2\xa7343, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he debtor shall appear and submit to examination under oath at the meeting of creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reading \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by\xe2\x80\x9d would make little sense here.  On the basis of these examples, Piccadilly concludes that the term \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Piccadilly maintains that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71146(a) should be construed broadly in light of \xc2\xa7365(g)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes<em> </em>the equivalent of a prebankruptcy breach \xe2\x80\x9cif such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter . . . 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Hechinger</em>, the Third Circuit concluded that substituting \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71146(a) would be consistent with the use of the parallel language in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1).  335 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 254.  Piccadilly attempts to refute <em>Hechinger</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7365(g)(1), asserting that, because authorization<em> </em>for the assumption of a lease under a plan is<em> </em>described in \xc2\xa71123(b)(2), which \xe2\x80\x9ccircles back to section 365,\xe2\x80\x9d such authorization cannot be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by\xe2\x80\x9d Chapter 11.  Brief for Respondent 39 (emphasis deleted); see 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71123(b)(2) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9ca plan may . . . subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment<em> </em>of any executory contract or unexpired<em> </em>lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section\xe2\x80\x9d).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder a<em> </em>plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1), contends Piccadilly, is thus best read to mean \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in accordance with</em> a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d because a plan may provide for the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease but not\xe2\x80\x94unlike \xc2\xa7365\xe2\x80\x94be the ultimate authority for that assumption.  As a result, Piccadilly concludes that the identical language of \xc2\xa71146(a) should have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly supports this point with its assertion that, unlike sales, postconfirmation assumptions or rejections are not permitted under the Bankruptcy Code.  See <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Bildisco &amp; Bildisco</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/513/index.html">465 U. S. 513</a>, 529 (1984) (stating that in \xe2\x80\x9ca Chapter 11 reorganization, a debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because, as Piccadilly contends, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed under chapter . . . 11\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1) cannot refer to assumptions or rejections occurring after confirmation, it would be anomalous to read the identical phrase in \xc2\xa71146(a) to cover <em>only</em> postconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For its part, Florida argues that the statutory context of \xc2\xa71146(a) supports its position that the stamp-tax exemption applies exclusively to postconfirmation transfers.  It observes that the subchapter in which \xc2\xa71146(a) appears is entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida contends that, while not dispositive, the placement of a provision in a particular subchapter suggests that its terms should be interpreted consistent with that subchapter.  See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/index.html">489 U. S. 803</a>, 809 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, Florida dismisses Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s references to the temporal limitations in other Code provisions on the ground that it would have been superfluous for Congress to add any further limitations to \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s already unambiguous temporal element.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even on the assumption that the text of \xc2\xa71146(a) is ambiguous, we are not persuaded by Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s contextual arguments.  As noted above, Congress could have used language that made \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s temporal element clear beyond question.  Unlike \xc2\xa71146(a), however, the temporal language examples quoted by Piccadilly are indispensable to the operative meaning of the provisions in which they appear.  Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa71127, for example, is misplaced because that section explicitly differentiates between preconfirmation modifications, see \xc2\xa71127(a), and postconfirmation modifications, which are permissible \xe2\x80\x9conly if circumstances warrant\xe2\x80\x9d them, \xc2\xa71127(b)<em>.</em>  It was unnecessary for Congress to include in \xc2\xa71146(a) a phrase such as \xe2\x80\x9cat any time after confirmation of such plan\xe2\x80\x9d because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d is most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we were to adopt Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9cunder,\xe2\x80\x9d its interpretation of the statute faces other obstacles.  The asset transfer here can hardly be said to have been consummated \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d any confirmed plan because, as of the closing date, Piccadilly had not even submitted its plan to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation.  Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s asset sale was thus not conducted \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d any plan confirmed under Chapter 11.  Rather, it was conducted \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d the procedures set forth in Chapter 3\xe2\x80\x94specifically, \xc2\xa7363(b)(1).  To read the statute as Piccadilly proposes would make \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption turn on whether a debtor-in-possession\xe2\x80\x99s actions are consistent with a legal instrument that does not exist\xe2\x80\x94and indeed may not even be conceived of\xe2\x80\x94at the time of the sale.  Reading <font caps="1">\xc2\xa71146(a) in context with other relevant Code provisions, we find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what is a straightforward exemption.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does anything in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1) recommend Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71146(a).  Section 365(g) generally allows a trustee to reject \xe2\x80\x9can executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e</em>., to reject a contract that is unfavorable to the estate, subject to court approval.  As the text makes clear, such approval may occur either under \xe2\x80\x9cthis section,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7365(g)\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cat any time before the confirmation of a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7365(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7365(g)(1).  Piccadilly relies heavily on <em>Bildisco</em>, <em>supra</em>, in which this Court held that \xc2\xa7365\npermits a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective-bargaining agreement like any other executory contract, and that doing so is not an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9ca debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed <em>to decide</em> whether to accept or reject an executory contract.\xe2\x80\x9d 465 U. S., at 529 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with <em>Bildisco</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>commonsense observation that the <em>decision</em> whether to reject a contract or lease must be made before confirmation.  But that in no way undermines the fact that the rejection takes <em>effect</em> upon or after confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan (or before confirmation if pursuant to \xc2\xa7365(d)(2)).  In the context of \xc2\xa71146(a), the decision whether to transfer a given asset \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d must be made prior to submitting the Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy court, but the transfer itself cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d until the court confirms the plan in question.  Only at that point does the transfer become eligible for the stamp-tax exemption.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the statutory context suggests anything, it is that \xc2\xa71146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers.  We find it informative that Congress placed \xc2\xa71146(a) in a subchapter entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS.\xe2\x80\x9d  To be sure, a subchapter heading cannot substitute for the operative text of the statute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U. S. 206</a>, 212 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the text\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nonetheless, statutory titles and section headings \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Porter</em> v. <em>Nussle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/516/index.html">534 U. S. 516</a>, 528 (2002).  The placement of \xc2\xa71146(a) within a subchapter expressly limited to postconfirmation matters undermines Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa71146(a) covers preconfirmation transfers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if we were fully to accept Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s textual and contextual arguments, they would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous.  They do not\xe2\x80\x94and largely are not intended to\xe2\x80\x94demonstrate that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Florida argues that various nontextual canons of construction require us to resolve any ambiguity in its favor.  Piccadilly responds with substantive canons of its own.  It is to these dueling canons of construction that we now turn.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida contends that even if the statutory text is deemed ambiguous, applicable substantive canons compel its interpretation of \xc2\xa71146(a).  Florida first invokes the canon that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lorillard </em>v.<em> Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (1978).  Florida observes that the relevant language of \xc2\xa71146(a) relating to \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d has remained unchanged since 1978 despite several revisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  The most recent revision in 2005 occurred after the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>NVR </em>and the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Hechinger</em> but before the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision below.  Florida asserts that Congress ratified this longstanding interpretation when, in its most recent amendments to the Code, it \xe2\x80\x9creadopted\xe2\x80\x9d the stamp-tax provision verbatim as \xc2\xa71146(a).  Brief for Petitioner 26.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida also invokes the substantive canon\xe2\x80\x94on which the Third Circuit relied in <em>Hechinger</em>\xe2\x80\x94that courts should \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  335 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 254 (quoting <em>California State Bd. of</em> <em>Equalization </em>v.<em> Sierra Summit, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/844/index.html">490 U. S. 844</a>, 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (1989)).  In light of this directive, Florida contends that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language must be construed strictly in favor of the States to prevent unwarranted displacement of their tax laws.  See <em>National Private</em> <em>Truck Council, Inc. </em>v.<em> Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/515/582/index.html">515 U.

See <em>id.</em>, at 586, 590.  Florida contends that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 extension of \xc2\xa71146(a) to preconfirmation transfers directly interferes with the administration of the State\xe2\x80\x99s stamp tax, which is imposed \xe2\x80\x9cprior to recordation\xe2\x80\x9d of the instrument of transfer.  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201.01, 201.02(1) (2006).  Extending the exemption to transfers that occurred months or years before a confirmable plan even existed, Florida explains, may require the States to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unravel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d stamp taxes already collected.  Brief for Petitioner 31.  Alternatively, should a court grant an exemption under \xc2\xa71146(a) before confirmation, States would be saddled with the task of monitoring whether the plan is ever eventually confirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, Piccadilly contends that the federalism principle articulated in <em>Sierra Summit, supra, </em>at 852, does not apply where there is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear expression of an exemption from state taxation\xe2\x80\x9d overriding a State\xe2\x80\x99s authority to tax.  In Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s view, that is precisely the case with regard to \xc2\xa71146(a), which proscribes the imposition of stamp taxes and demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to exempt a category of state taxation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Piccadilly further maintains that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s stamp tax is nothing more than a postpetition claim, specifically an administrative expense, which is paid as a priority claim ahead of the prepetition claims of most creditors.  Equating Florida\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of tax revenue with a preference in favor of a particular claimant, Piccadilly argues that \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous exemption should not be construed to diminish other claimants\xe2\x80\x99 recoveries.  See <em>Howard Delivery Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>Zurich American Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/651/index.html">547 U.

Brief for Respondent 54 (quoting <em>Howard Delivery Serv., supra</em>, at 667)<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Above all, Piccadilly urges us to adopt the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 maxim that \xe2\x80\x9ca remedial statute such as the Bankruptcy Code should be liberally construed.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>484 F. 3d, at 1304; cf. <em>Isbrandtsen Co.</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/779/index.html">343 U. S. 779</a>, 782 (1952).  In Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s view, any ambiguity in the statutory text is overshadowed by \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s obvious purpose: to facilitate the Chapter 11 process \xe2\x80\x9cthrough giving tax relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re Jacoby-Bender</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, 758 F. 2d 840, 841 (CA2 1985).  Piccadilly characterizes the tax on asset transfers at issue here as tantamount to a levy on the bankruptcy process itself.  A stamp tax like Florida\xe2\x80\x99s makes the sale of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s property more expensive and reduces the total proceeds available to satisfy the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 claims, contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear intent in enacting \xc2\xa71146(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is unclear, Piccadilly argues, is why \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would have intended the anomaly that a transfer essential to a plan that occurs two minutes before confirmation may be taxed, but the same transfer occurring two seconds after may not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 43.  After all, interpreting \xc2\xa71146(a) in the manner Florida proposes would lead precisely to that result.  And that, Piccadilly asserts, is \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd\xe2\x80\x9d in light of \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s policy aim\xe2\x80\x94evidenced by the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text and legislative history\xe2\x80\x94of reducing the cost of asset transfers.  In that vein, Piccadilly contends that interpreting \xc2\xa71146(a) to apply solely to postconfirmation transfers would undermine Chapter 11\xe2\x80\x99s twin objectives of \xe2\x80\x9cpreserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn.</em> v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/434/index.html">526 U. S. 434</a>, 453 (1999).  In order to obtain the maximum value for its assets\xe2\x80\x94especially assets rapidly declining in value\xe2\x80\x94Piccadilly claims that a debtor often must close the sale before formal confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Florida that the federalism canon articulated in <em>Sierra Summit </em>and elsewhere obliges us to construe \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption narrowly.  Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s effort to evade the canon falls well short of the mark because reading \xc2\xa71146(a) in the manner Piccadilly proposes would require us to do exactly what the canon counsels against.  If we recognized an exemption for preconfirmation transfers, we would in effect be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recogniz[ing] an exemption from state taxation that <em>Congress has not clearly expressed</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, an exemption for preconfirmation transfers.  <em>Sierra Summit</em>, 490 U. S., at 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (emphasis added); see also <em>Swarts</em> v. <em>Hammer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/194/441/index.html">194 U. S. 441</a>, 444 (1904) (reasoning that if Congress endeavored to exempt a debtor from state and local taxation, \xe2\x80\x9cthe intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, Piccadilly proves precisely this point by resting its entire case on the premise that Congress has expressed its stamp-tax exemption in ambiguous language.  Therefore, far from being inapposite, the canon is decisive in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The canons on which Piccadilly relies are inapposite.  While we agree with Piccadilly that \xe2\x80\x9cprovisions allowing preferences must be tightly construed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Howard Delivery Serv.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 667, \xc2\xa71146(a) is not a preference-granting provision.  The statutory text makes no mention of \npreferences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we persuaded that in this case we should construe \xc2\xa71146(a) \xe2\x80\x9cliberally\xe2\x80\x9d to serve its ostensibly \xe2\x80\x9cremedial\xe2\x80\x9d purpose.  Based on the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that the Bankruptcy Code is a \xe2\x80\x9cremedial statute,\xe2\x80\x9d Piccadilly would stretch the disallowance well beyond what the statutory text can naturally bear.  Apart from the opinion below, however, the only authority Piccadilly offers is a 1952 decision of this Court interpreting the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872.  See Brief for Respondent 54 (citing <em>Isbrandtsen</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 782).  But unlike the statutory scheme in <em>Isbrandtsen</em>, which was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98designed to secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship, hospitalization at home and care abroad,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 343 U. S., at 784 (quoting <em>Aguilar</em> v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. J.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/724/index.html">318 U. S. 724</a>, 728 (1943)), the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x94and Chapter 11 in particular\xe2\x80\x94is not a remedial statute in that sense.  To the contrary, this Court has rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress had a single purpose in enacting Chapter 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Toibb</em> v. <em>Radloff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/157/index.html">501 U. S. 157</a>, 163 (1991).  Rather, Chapter 11 strikes a balance between a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in reorganizing and restructuring its debts and the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Code also accommodates the interests of the States in regulating property transfers by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generally [leaving] the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt\xe2\x80\x99s estate to state law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America</em> v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7 ).  Such interests often do not coincide, and in this case, they clearly do not.  We therefore decline to construe the exemption granted by \xc2\xa71146(a) to the detriment of the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that reading \xc2\xa71146(a) to allow preconfirmation transfers to be taxed while exempting others moments later would amount to an \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd\xe2\x80\x9d policy, we reiterate that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is not for us to substitute our view of . . . policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hechinger</em>, 335 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 256.  That said, we see no absurdity in reading \xc2\xa71146(a) as setting forth a simple, bright-line rule instead of the complex, after-the-fact inquiry Piccadilly envisions.  At bottom, we agree with the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s summation of \xc2\xa71146(a):</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCongress struck a most reasonable balance.  If a debtor is able to develop a Chapter 11 reorganization and obtain confirmation, then the debtor is to be afforded relief from certain taxation to facilitate the implementation of the reorganization plan.  Before a debtor reaches this point, however, the state and local tax systems may not be subjected to federal interference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NVR</em>, 189 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 458.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lastly, to the extent the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical realities\xe2\x80\x9d of Chapter 11 reorganizations are increasingly rendering postconfirmation transfers a thing of the past, see 484 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1304, it is incumbent upon the Legislature, and not the Judiciary, to determine whether \xc2\xa71146(a) is in need of revision.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ali</em> v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14 ) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of \xc2\xa71146(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s placement within the Code, and applicable substantive canons all lead to the same conclusion: Section 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed.  Because Piccadilly transferred its assets before its Chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not rely on \xc2\xa71146(a) to avoid Florida\xe2\x80\x99s stamp taxes.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0When litigation commenced in the lower courts, the stamp-tax exemption was contained in \xc2\xa71146(c) (2000 ed.).  In 2005, Congress repealed subsections (a) and (b), and the stamp-tax exemption was recodified as \xc2\xa71146(a).  See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \xc2\xa7719(b)(3), 119 Stat. 133.  For simplicity, we will cite the provision as it is currently codified.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ordinarily culminate in the confirmation of a reorganization plan.  But in some cases, as here, a debtor sells all or substantially all its assets under \xc2\xa7363(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V) before seeking or receiving plan confirmation.  In this scenario, the debtor typically submits for confirmation a plan of liquidation (rather than a traditional plan of reorganization) providing for the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the sale.  Here, Piccadilly filed a Chapter 11 liquidation plan after selling substantially all its assets as a going concern.  Although the central purpose of Chapter 11 is to facilitate reorganizations rather than liquidations (covered generally by Chapter 7), Chapter 11 expressly contemplates liquidations.  See \xc2\xa71129(a)(11) (2000 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cConfirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Also meritless is Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed under chapter . . . 11\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1) cannot be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9csubject to\xe2\x80\x9d because \xc2\xa71123(b)(2), in Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9ccircles back to section 365.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 39.  Section 1123(b)(2) authorizes a plan to provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease, but requires that the plan do so in a manner consistent with the various requirements set forth throughout \xc2\xa7365.  By contrast, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this section\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7365(g)(1) serves as a reference to \xc2\xa7365(d)(2), which permits preconfirmation assumptions and rejections pursuant to a court order (and not, as in \xc2\xa71123(b)(2), pursuant to a confirmed plan).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font caps="1"><font super="1">\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font caps="1"><font super="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962739">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nFLORIDA DEPT.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71146(a) (2000 ed., Supp V) (previously \xc2\xa71146(c)) (emphasis added).  In this case, the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s reorganization \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d provides for the \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d of assets.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d itself was not \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e</em>., the Bankruptcy Judge did not formally approve the plan) until <em>after </em>the \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d of assets took place.  See \xc2\xa71129 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (detailing the requirements for bankruptcy court approval of a Chapter 11 plan).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence we must ask whether the time of transfer matters.  Do the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d apply only where a transfer takes place \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan\xe2\x80\x9d that at the time of the transfer <em>already has been </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d?  Or, do they also apply where a transfer takes place \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>subsequently is </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title\xe2\x80\x9d?  The Court concludes that the statutory phrase applies only where a transfer takes place \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan\xe2\x80\x9d that at the time of transfer <em>already has been </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed under section 1129 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my view, however, the statutory phrase applies \xe2\x80\x9cunder a plan\xe2\x80\x9d that at the time of transfer either <em>already has been </em>or <em>subsequently is </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a word, the majority believes that the time<em> </em>(pre- or post-transfer)<em> </em>at which the bankruptcy judge confirms the reorganization plan matters.  I believe that it does not.  (And construing the provision to refer to a plan that simply \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed would require us to read fewer words into the statute than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction, which reads the provision to refer only to a plan \xe2\x80\x9cthat has been\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed, <em>ante</em>, at 19.)  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory language itself is perfectly ambiguous on the point.  Linguistically speaking, it is no more difficult to apply the words \xe2\x80\x9cplan confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d to instances in which the \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d <em>subsequently is </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d than to restrict their application to instances in which the \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d <em>already has been </em>\xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc</em>., 484 F. 3d 1299, 1304 (CA11 2007) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he statute can plausibly be read either as describing eligible transfers to include transfers \xe2\x80\x98under a plan confirmed\xe2\x80\x99 regardless of <em>when</em> the plan is confirmed, <em>or </em>. . . imposing a temporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan must occur\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  Cf. <em>In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del.,</em> 335 F. 3d 243, 252\xe2\x80\x93253 (CA3 2003) (majority opinion of Alito, J.)

But cf. <em>ante</em>, at 7 (majority believes its reading is \xe2\x80\x9cclearly the more natural\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can I find any text-based argument that points clearly in one direction rather than the other.  Indeed, the majority, after methodically combing the textualist beaches, finds that a comparison with other somewhat similar phrases in the Bankruptcy Code sheds little light.  For example, on the one hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation mattered, why did it not say so expressly as it has done elsewhere in the Code?  See, <em>e.g</em>., 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71127(b) (plan proponent may modify it \xe2\x80\x9cat any time <em>after </em>confirmation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa71104(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]t any time after the commencement of the case but <em>before </em>confirmation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa71104(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cat any time <em>before</em> the confirmation of a plan\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa71114(e)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>before</em> a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title is effective\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  On the other hand, if Congress thought the time of confirmation did <em>not </em>matter, why did it place this provision in a subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPOSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS\xe2\x80\x9d?  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C., ch. 11, subch. III.  (And yet one could also argue that the tax exemption provision appears under the \xe2\x80\x9cpostconfirmation matters\xe2\x80\x9d title because the trigger for the exemption is plan confirmation.  Thus, the exemption is a \xe2\x80\x9cpostconfirmation matter,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of when the transfer occurs.)  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The canons of interpretation offer little help.  And the majority, for the most part, seems to agree.  It ultimately rests its interpretive conclusion upon this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that courts \xe2\x80\x9cmust proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that Congress has not clearly expressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>California State Bd. of Equalization</em> v. <em>Sierra Summit, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/844/index.html">490 U. S. 844</a>, 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.  But when, as here, we interpret a provision the <em>express point of which </em>is to exempt some category of state taxation, how can the statement in <em>Sierra Summit</em> prove determinative?  See \xc2\xa71146(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129 of this title, <em>may not be taxed</em> under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither does Florida\xe2\x80\x99s related claim, protesting federal interference in the <em>administration </em>of a State\xe2\x80\x99s taxation scheme seem plausible.  See Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cadditional difficulties and complexities that will proliferate\xe2\x80\x9d under the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision).  <em>If </em>Florida now requires transferees to file a <em>pre-existing</em> confirmed plan in order to avoid payment of the stamp tax, then why could Florida not require a transferee under a not-yet-confirmed plan to pay the stamp tax and then file the plan after its confirmation in order to obtain a refund?  (If there is some other, less curable, practical problem, Florida has not explained what it is.)  Given these difficulties, I suspect that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon <em>Sierra Summit</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccanon,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, reflects no more than an effort to find the proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cany port\xe2\x80\x9d in this interpretive storm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of a clear answer in text or canons, however, should not lead us to judicial despair.  Consistent with Court precedent, we can and should ask a further question: <em>Why </em>would Congress have insisted upon temporal limits?  What reasonable <em>purpose </em>might such limits serve?  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cInterpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, <em>considering the purpose</em> and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U.

In fact, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of temporal limits in \xc2\xa71146(a) serves <em>no reasonable congressional purpose at all.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is apparent on its face.

See also <em>Toibb</em> v. <em>Radloff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/157/index.html">501 U. S. 157</a>, 163 (1991) (Chapter 11 \xe2\x80\x9cembodies the general [Bankruptcy] Code policy of maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x9d).  As an important bankruptcy treatise notes, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n addition to tax relief, the purpose of the exemption of [\xc2\xa71146(a)] is to encourage and facilitate bankruptcy asset sales.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb61146.02, p. 1146\xe2\x80\x933 (15th ed. rev. 2005).  It furthers these objectives where, <em>e.g</em>., asset transfers are at issue, by turning over to the estate (for the use of creditors or to facilitate reorganization) funds that otherwise would go to pay state stamp taxes on plan-related transferred assets.  The requirement that the transfers take place pursuant to a reorganization \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d provides the bankruptcy judge\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that the transfer meets with creditor approval and the requirements laid out in \xc2\xa71129.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How would the majority\xe2\x80\x99s temporal limitation further these statutory objectives?  It would not do so in any way.  From the perspective of these purposes, it makes no difference whether a transfer takes place before or after the plan is confirmed.  In both instances the exemption puts in the hands of the creditors or the estate money that would otherwise go to the State in the form of a stamp tax.  In both instances the confirmation of the related plan assures the legitimacy (from bankruptcy law\xe2\x80\x99s perspective) of the plan that provides for the assets transfer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, one major reason why a transfer may take place <em>before </em>rather than <em>after </em>a plan is confirmed is that the preconfirmation bankruptcy process takes time.  As the Administrative Office of the United States Courts recently reported, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] Chapter 11 case may continue for many years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bankruptcy Basics (Apr. 2006), online at http://www.uscourts.gov/bankruptcycourts/bankruptcybasics/\nchapter11.html (as visited June 13, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Accord, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Hechinger Inv. Co</em>. <em>of Del</em>., 254 B.\xc2\xa0R. 306, 320 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2000) (noting it may run \xe2\x80\x9ca year or two\xe2\x80\x9d).  And a firm (or its assets) may have more value (say, as a going concern) where sale takes place quickly.  As the District Court in this case acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are times when it is more advantageous for the debtor to begin to sell as many assets as quickly as possible in order to insure that the assets do not lose value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>379 B.\xc2\xa0R. 215, 224 (SD Fla. 2006) (internal quotations marks and alteration omitted).  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>In\xc2\xa0re Webster Classic Auctions, Inc</em>., 318 B.\xc2\xa0R. 216, 219 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Fla. 2004) (recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe inestimable benefit to a Chapter 11 estate to sell a piece of property at the most opportune time\xe2\x80\x94whether pre- or postconfirmation\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to requiring all concerned to wait for a postconfirmation sale in order to receive the tax relief Congress obviously intended\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Medical Software Solutions</em>, 286 B.\xc2\xa0R. 431, 441 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Utah 2002) (approving preconfirmation sale of debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets recognizing that the assets\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cvalue is reducing rapidly\xe2\x80\x9d and there was only a narrow window for a viable sale of the assets).  Thus, an immediate sale can often make more revenue available to creditors or for reorganization of the remaining assets.  Stamp taxes on related transfers simply reduce the funds available for any such legitimate purposes.  And insofar as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute reduces the funds made available, that interpretation inhibits the statute\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to achieve its basic objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worse than that, if the potential loss of stamp tax revenue threatens delay in implementing any such decision to sell, then creditors (or the remaining reorganized enterprise) could suffer far more serious harm.  They could lose the extra revenues that a speedy sale might otherwise produce.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>In\xc2\xa0re Met-L-Wood Corp</em>., 861 F.\xc2\xa02d 1012, 1017 (CA7 1988) (as suppliers and customers \xe2\x80\x9cshy away,\xe2\x80\x9d it can make sense quickly to sell business to other owners so that it \xe2\x80\x9ccan continue\xe2\x80\x9d to operate \xe2\x80\x9cfree of the stigma and uncertainty of bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the present case, for example, Piccadilly, by selling assets quickly after strategic negotiation, realized $80 million, considerably more than the $54 million originally offered before Piccadilly filed for bankruptcy.  That fact, along with the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of \xe2\x80\x9csound business reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for the prompt sale of Piccadilly\xe2\x80\x99s assets and that the expeditious sale was \xe2\x80\x9cin the best interests of creditors of [Piccadilly] and other parties in interest,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 32a, suggest that considerably less would have been available for creditors had Piccadilly waited until after the plan\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation to execute the sale plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What conceivable reason could Congress have had for silently writing into the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language a temporal distinction with such consequences?  The majority can find none.  It simply says that the result is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absurd\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and notes the advantages of a \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  I agree that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is not absurd and do not dispute the advantages of a clear rule.  But I think the statute supplies a clear enough rule\xe2\x80\x94transfers are exempt when there is confirmation and are not exempt when there is no confirmation.  And I see no reason to adopt the majority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred construction (that only transfers completed after plan confirmation are exempt), where it conflicts with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, we should not substitute \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c<em>our view </em>of \xe2\x80\xa6 policy\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for the statute that Congress enacted.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (emphasis added).  But we certainly should consider <em>Congress</em>\xe2\x80\x99 view of the policy for the statute it created, and that view inheres in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  \xe2\x80\x9cStatutory interpretation is not a game of blind man\xe2\x80\x99s bluff.  Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 484 (2003) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  It is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s failure to work with this important tool of statutory interpretation that has led it to construe the present statute in a way that, in my view, runs contrary to what Congress would have hoped for and expected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
