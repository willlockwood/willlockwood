S. 421</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether a minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner\'s property authorized by government constitutes a "taking" of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  New York law provides that a landlord must permit a cable television company to install its cable facilities upon his property.  N.Y.Exec.Law \xc2\xa7 828(1) (McKinney Supp.1981-1982).  In this case, the cable installation occupied portions of appellant\'s roof and the side of her building.  The New York Court of Appeals ruled that this appropriation does not amount to a taking.  53 N.Y.2d 124, 423 N.E.2d 320 (1981).  Because we conclude that such a physical occupation of property is a taking, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellant Jean Loretto purchased a five-story apartment building located at 303 West 105th Street, New York City, in 1971.  The previous owner had granted appellees Teleprompter Corp. and Teleprompter Manhattan CATV (collectively Teleprompter) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] permission to install a cable on the building and the exclusive privilege of furnishing cable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 458 U. S. 422</a></p><p> television (CATV) services to the tenants.  The New York Court of Appeals described the installation as follows:</p>\n<p>"On June 1, 1970 TelePrompter installed a cable slightly less than one-half inch in diameter and of approximately 30 feet in length along the length of the building about 18 inches above the roof top, and directional taps, approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 4 inches, on the front and rear of the roof.  By June 8, 1970 the cable had been extended another 4 to 6 feet and cable had been run from the directional taps to the adjoining building at 305 West 105th Street."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 135, 423 N.E.2d at 324.  Teleprompter also installed two large silver boxes along the roof cables.  The cables are attached by screws or nails penetrating the masonry at approximately two-foot intervals, and other equipment is installed by bolts.</p>\n<p>Initially, Teleprompter\'s roof cables did not service appellant\'s building.  They were part of what could be described as a cable "highway" circumnavigating the city block, with service cables periodically dropped over the front or back of a building in which a tenant desired service.  Crucial to such a network is the use of so-called "crossovers" -- cable lines extending from one building to another in order to reach a new group of tenants. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Two years after appellant purchased the building, Teleprompter connected a "noncrossover" line -- <em>i.e.,</em> one that provided CATV service to appellant\'s own tenants -- by dropping a line to the first floor down the front of appellant\'s building. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 458 U. S. 423</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Prior to 1973, Teleprompter routinely obtained authorization for its installations from property owners along the cable\'s route, compensating the owners at the standard rate of 5% of the gross revenues that Teleprompter realized from the particular property.  To facilitate tenant access to CATV, the State of New York enacted \xc2\xa7 828 of the Executive Law, effective January 1, 1973.  Section 828 provides that a landlord may not "interfere with the installation of cable television facilities upon his property or premises," and may not demand payment from any tenant for permitting CATV, or demand payment from any CATV company "in excess of any amount which the [State Commission on Cable Television] shall, by regulation, determine to be reasonable." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The landlord may, however, require the CATV company or the tenant to bear the cost of installation and to indemnify for any damage caused by the installation.  Pursuant to \xc2\xa7 828(1)(b), the State Commission has ruled that a one-time $1 payment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 458 U. S. 424</a></p><p> is the normal fee to which a landlord is entitled.  <em>In the Matter of Implementation of Section 828 of the Executive Law,</em> No. 90004, Statement of General Policy (New York State Commission on Cable Television, Jan. 15, 1976) (Statement of General Policy), App. 51-52; Clarification of General Policy (Aug. 27, 1976), App. 68-69.  The Commission ruled that this nominal fee, which the Commission concluded was equivalent to what the landlord would receive if the property were condemned pursuant to New York\'s Transportation Corporations Law, satisfied constitutional requirements "in the absence of a special showing of greater damages attributable to the taking."  Statement of General Policy, App. 52.</p>\n<p>Appellant did not discover the existence of the cable until after she had purchased the building.  She brought a class action against Teleprompter in 1976 on behalf of all owners of real property in the State on which Teleprompter has placed CATV components, alleging that Teleprompter\'s installation was a trespass and, insofar as it relied on \xc2\xa7 828, a taking without just compensation.  She requested damages and injunctive relief. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Appellee City of New York, which has granted Teleprompter an exclusive franchise to provide CATV within certain areas of Manhattan, intervened.  The Supreme Court, Special Term, granted summary judgment to Teleprompter and the city, upholding the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 828 in both crossover and noncrossover situations.  98 Misc.2d 944, 415 N.Y.S.2d 180 (1979).  The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion.  73 App.Div.2d 849, 422 N.Y.S.2d 550 (1979).</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals, over dissent, upheld the statute.  53 N.Y.2d 124, 423 N.E.2d 320 (1981).  The court concluded that the law requires the landlord to allow both crossover and noncrossover installations, but permits him to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 458 U. S. 425</a></p><p> request payment from the CATV company under \xc2\xa7 828(1)(b), at a level determined by the State Cable Commission, only for noncrossovers.  The court then ruled that the law serves a legitimate police power purpose -- eliminating landlord fees and conditions that inhibit the development of CATV, which has important educational and community benefits.  Rejecting the argument that a physical occupation authorized by government is necessarily a taking, the court stated that the regulation does not have an excessive economic impact upon appellant when measured against her aggregate property rights, and that it does not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectations.  Accordingly, the court held that \xc2\xa7 828 does not work a taking of appellant\'s property.  Chief Judge Cooke dissented, reasoning that the physical appropriation of a portion of appellant\'s property is a taking without regard to the balancing analysis courts ordinarily employ in evaluating whether a regulation is a taking.</p>\n<p>In light of its holding, the Court of Appeals had no occasion to determine whether the $1 fee ordinarily awarded for a noncrossover installation was adequate compensation for the taking.  Judge Gabrielli, concurring, agreed with the dissent that the law works a taking, but concluded that the $1 presumptive award, together with the procedures permitting a landlord to demonstrate a greater entitlement, affords just compensation.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  454 U.S. 938 (1981).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals determined that \xc2\xa7 828 serves the legitimate public purpose of "rapid development of and maximum penetration by a means of communication which has important educational and community aspects," 53 N.Y.2d at 143-144, 423 N.E.2d at 329, and thus is within the State\'s police power.  We have no reason to question that determination.  It is a separate question, however, whether an otherwise valid regulation so frustrates property rights that compensation must be paid.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">Penn Central Transportation</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 458 U.

We conclude that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.  Our constitutional history confirms the rule, recent cases do not question it, and the purposes of the Takings Clause compel its retention.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, supra,</em> the Court surveyed some of the general principles governing the Takings Clause.  The Court noted that no "set formula" existed to determine, in all cases, whether compensation is constitutionally due for a government restriction of property.  Ordinarily, the Court must engage in "essentially <em>ad hoc,</em> factual inquiries."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html#124">438 U. S. 124</a></span>.  But the inquiry is not standardless.  The economic impact of the regulation, especially the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations, is of particular significance.</p>\n<p>"So, too, is the character of the governmental action.  A \'taking\' may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>As <em>Penn Central</em> affirms, the Court has often upheld substantial regulation of an owner\'s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest.  At the same time, we have long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause.  Our cases further establish that, when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred.  In such a case, "the character of the government action" not only is an important factor in resolving whether the action works a taking, but also is determinative. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 458 U. S. 427</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property, this Court has invariably found a taking. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As early as 1872, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/166/case.html">Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co.,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 166, this Court held that the defendant\'s construction, pursuant to state authority, of a dam which permanently flooded plaintiff\'s property constituted a taking.  A unanimous Court stated, without qualification, that</p>\n<p>"where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material, or by having any artificial structure placed on it, so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/166/case.html#181">80 U. S. 181</a></span>.  Seven years later, the Court reemphasized the importance of a physical occupation by distinguishing a regulation that merely restricted the use of private property.  In <em>Northern Transportation Co. v. Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/635/case.html">99 U. S. 635</a></span> (1879), the Court held that the city\'s construction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 458 U. S. 428</a></p><p> of a temporary dam in a river to permit construction of a tunnel was not a taking, even though the plaintiffs were thereby denied access to their premises, because the obstruction only impaired the use of plaintiffs\' property.  The Court distinguished earlier cases in which permanent flooding of private property was regarded as a taking, <em>e.g., Pumpelly, supra,</em> as involving "a physical invasion of the real estate of the private owner, and a practical ouster of his possession."  In this case, by contrast, "[n]o entry was made upon the plaintiffs\' lot."  99 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/635/case.html#642">99 U. S. 642</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Since these early cases, this Court has consistently distinguished between flooding cases involving a permanent physical occupation, on the one hand, and cases involving a more temporary invasion, or government action outside the owner\'s property that causes consequential damages within, on the other.  A taking has always been found only in the former situation.  <em>See United States v. Lynah,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/445/case.html">188 U.

The space he occupies one moment he abandons the next to be occupied by any other traveller. . . .  <em>But the use made by the telegraph company is, in respect to so much of the space as it occupies with its poles, permanent and exclusive.</em>  It as effectually and permanently dispossesses the general public as if it had destroyed that amount of ground.

In holding that federal law did not grant the company the right of eminent domain or the right to operate the lines absent the railroad\'s consent, the Court assumed that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 458 U.

Later cases, relying on the character of a physical occupation, clearly establish that permanent occupations of land by such installations as telegraph and telephone lines, rails, and underground pipes or wires are takings even if they occupy only relatively insubstantial amounts of space and do not seriously interfere with the landowner\'s use of the rest of his land.  <em>See, e.g., Lovett v.

Although the easement of passage, not being a permanent occupation of land, was not considered a taking <em>per se, Kaiser Aetna</em> reemphasizes that a physical invasion is a government intrusion of an unusually serious character.

S. 74</a></span> (1980), the Court upheld a state constitutional requirement that shopping center owners permit individuals to exercise free speech and petition rights on their property, to which they had already invited the general public.  The Court emphasized that the State Constitution does not prevent the owner from restricting expressive activities by imposing reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to minimize interference with the owner\'s commercial functions.  Since the invasion was temporary and limited in nature, and since the owner had not exhibited an interest in excluding all persons from his property, "the fact that [the solicitors] may have <em>physically invaded\' [the owners\'] property cannot be viewed as determinative."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/74/case.html#84">447 U. S. 84</a></span>. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>In short, when the "character of the governmental action," <em>Penn Central,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html#124">438 U. S. 124</a></span>, is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 458 U. S. 435</a></p><p> whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The historical rule that a permanent physical occupation of another\'s property is a taking has more than tradition to commend it.  Such an appropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an owner\'s property interests.  To borrow a metaphor, <em>cf. Andrus v. Allard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html">444 U. S. 51</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html#65">444 U. S. 65</a></span> 66 (1979), the government does not simply take a single "strand" from the "bundle" of property rights:  it chops through the bundle, taking a slice of every strand.</p>\n<p>Property rights in a physical thing have been described as the rights "to possess, use and dispose of it."  <em>United States v. General Motors Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/373/case.html">323 U. S. 373</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/373/case.html#378">323 U. S. 378</a></span> (1945).  To the extent that the government permanently occupies physical property, it effectively destroys each of these rights.  First, the owner has no right to possess the occupied space himself, and also has no power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space.  The power to exclude has traditionally been considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner\'s bundle of property rights. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>See Kaiser Aetna,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 458 U. S. 436</a></p><p> 444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html#179">444 U. S. 179</a></span>-180; <em>see also</em> Restatement of Property \xc2\xa7 7 (1936).  Second, the permanent physical occupation of property forever denies the owner any power to control the use of the property; he not only cannot exclude others, but can make no nonpossessory use of the property.  Although deprivation of the right to use and obtain a profit from property is not, in every case, independently sufficient to establish a taking, <em>see Andrus v. Allard, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/51/case.html#66">444 U. S. 66</a></span>, it is clearly relevant.  Finally, even though the owner may retain the bare legal right to dispose of the occupied space by transfer or sale, the permanent occupation of that space by a stranger will ordinarily empty the right of any value, since the purchaser will also be unable to make any use of the property.</p>\n<p>Moreover, an owner suffers a special kind of injury when a stranger directly invades and occupies the owner\'s property.  As  <span class="l-normal">458 U. S. </span> <em>supra,</em> indicates, property law has long protected an owner\'s expectation that he will be relatively undisturbed at least in the possession of his property.  To require, as well, that the owner permit another to exercise complete dominion literally adds insult to injury.  <em>See</em> Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness:  Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1165, 1228, and n. 110 (1967).  Furthermore, such an occupation is qualitatively more severe than a regulation of the use of property, even a regulation that imposes affirmative duties on the owner, since the owner may have no control over the timing, extent, or nature of the invasion.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F19" name="T19">n</a>19, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>The traditional rule also avoids otherwise difficult linedrawing problems.  Few would disagree that, if the State required landlords to permit third parties to install swimming pools on the landlords\' rooftops for the convenience of the tenants, the requirement would be a taking.  If the cable installation here occupied as much space, again, few would disagree that the occupation would be a taking.  But constitutional protection for the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on the size of the area permanently occupied. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 458 U. S. 437</a></p><p> Indeed, it is possible that, in the future, additional cable installations that more significantly restrict a landlord\'s use of the roof of his building will be made.  Section 828 requires a landlord to permit such multiple installations. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, whether a permanent physical occupation has occurred presents relatively few problems of proof.  The placement of a fixed structure on land or real property is an obvious fact that will rarely be subject to dispute.  Once the fact of occupation is shown, of course, a court should consider the extent of the occupation as one relevant factor in determining the compensation due. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  For that reason, moreover, there is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 458 U. S. 438</a></p><p> less need to consider the extent of the occupation in determining whether there is a taking in the first instance.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Teleprompter\'s cable installation on appellant\'s building constitutes a taking under the traditional test.  The installation involved a direct physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon the roof and along the building\'s exterior wall. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of our analysis, we find no constitutional difference between a crossover and a noncrossover installation.  The portions of the installation necessary for both crossovers and noncrossovers permanently appropriate appellant\'s property.  Accordingly, each type of installation is a taking.</p>\n<p>Appellees raise a series of objections to application of the traditional rule here.  Teleprompter notes that the law applies only to buildings used as rental property, and draws the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 458 U. S. 439</a></p><p> conclusion that the law is simply a permissible regulation of the use of real property.  We fail to see, however, why a physical occupation of one type of property but not another type is any less a physical occupation.  Insofar as Teleprompter means to suggest that this is not a permanent physical invasion, we must differ.  So long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation, the landlord must permit it. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Teleprompter also asserts the related argument that the State has effectively granted a tenant the property right to have a CATV installation placed on the roof of his building, as an appurtenance to the tenant\'s leasehold.  The short answer is that \xc2\xa7 828(1)(a) does not purport to give the tenant any enforceable property rights with respect to CATV installation, and the lower courts did not rest their decisions on this ground. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Of course, Teleprompter, not appellant\'s tenants, actually owns the installation.  Moreover, the government does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights.  <em>See Webb\'s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/155/case.html">449 U. S. 155</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/155/case.html#164">449 U.

S. 440</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, we do not agree with appellees that application of the physical occupation rule will have dire consequences for the government\'s power to adjust landlord-tenant relationships.  This Court has consistently affirmed that States have broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails.  <em>See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/241/case.html">379 U.

In none of these cases, however, did the government authorize the permanent occupation of the landlord\'s property by a third party.  Consequently, our holding today in no way alters the analysis governing the State\'s power to require landlords to comply with building codes and provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building.  So long as these regulations do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party, they will be analyzed under the multifactor inquiry generally applicable to nonpossessory governmental activity.  <em>See Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U. S. 104</a></span> (1978).

We affirm the traditional rule that a permanent physical occupation of property is a taking.  In such a case, the property owner entertains a historically rooted expectation of compensation, and the character of the invasion is qualitatively more intrusive than perhaps any other category of property regulation.  We do not, however, question the equally substantial authority upholding a State\'s broad power to impose appropriate restrictions upon an owner\'s use of his property.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our conclusion that \xc2\xa7 828 works a taking of a portion of appellant\'s property does not presuppose that the fee which many landlords had obtained from Teleprompter prior to the law\'s enactment is a proper measure of the value of the property taken.  The issue of the amount of compensation that is due, on which we express no opinion, is a matter for the state courts to consider on remand.

The modern significance of physical occupation is that courts, while they sometimes do hold nontrespassory injuries compensable, <em>never</em> deny compensation for a physical takeover.

App. 90; Loretto Affidavit in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (Apr. 21, 1978), Appellants\' Appendix in No. 8300/76 (N.Y.App.), p. 77.  Although the record does not reveal their size, appellant states that they are approximately 18" x 12" x 6", Brief for Appellant 6 n.*, and appellees do not dispute this statement.  The displaced volume, then, is in excess of 1 1/2 cubic feet.  In any event, these facts are not critical:  whether the installation is a taking does not depend on whether the volume of space it occupies is bigger than a breadbox.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>It is true that the landlord could avoid the requirements of \xc2\xa7 828 by ceasing to rent the building to tenants.  But a landlord\'s ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation.  Teleprompter\'s broad "use-dependency" argument proves too much.  For example, it would allow the government to require a landlord to devote a substantial portion of his building to vending and washing machines, with all profits to be retained by the owners of these services and with no compensation for the deprivation of space.  It would even allow the government to requisition a certain number of apartments as permanent government offices.  The right of a property owner to exclude a stranger\'s physical occupation of his land cannot be so easily manipulated.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>We also decline to hazard an opinion as to the respective rights of the landlord and tenant under state law prior to enactment of \xc2\xa7 828 to use the space occupied by the cable installation, an issue over which the parties sharply disagree.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>If \xc2\xa7 828 required landlords to provide cable installation if a tenant so desires, the statute might present a different question from the question before us, since the landlord would own the installation.  Ownership would give the landlord rights to the placement, manner, use, and possibly the disposition of the installation.  The fact of ownership is, contrary to the dissent, not simply "incidental," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#450">458 U. S. 450</a></span>; it would give a landlord (rather than a CATV company) full authority over the installation except only as government specifically limited that authority.  The <em>landlord</em> would decide how to comply with applicable government regulations concerning CATV, and therefore could minimize the physical, esthetic, and other effects of the installation.  Moreover, if the landlord wished to repair, demolish, or construct in the area of the building where the installation is located, he need not incur the burden of obtaining the CATV company\'s cooperation in moving the cable.</p>\n<p>In this case, by contrast, appellant suffered injury that might have been obviated if she had owned the cable and could exercise control over its installation.  The drilling and stapling that accompanied installation apparently caused physical damage to appellant\'s building.  App. 83, 95-96, 104.  Appellant, who resides in her building, further testified that the cable installation is "ugly."  <em>Id.</em> at 99.  Although \xc2\xa7 828 provides that a landlord may require "reasonable" conditions that are "necessary" to protect the appearance of the premises and may seek indemnity for damage, these provisions are somewhat limited.  Even if the provisions are effective, the inconvenience to the landlord of initiating the repairs remains a cognizable burden.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of our disposition of appellant\'s takings claim, we do not address her contention that \xc2\xa7 828 deprives her of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>If the Court\'s decisions construing the Takings Clause state anything clearly, it is that "[t]here is no set formula to determine where regulation ends and taking begins."  <em>Goldblatt v.

To sustain its rule against our recent precedents, the Court erects a strained and untenable distinction between "temporary physical invasions," whose constitutionality concededly "is subject to a balancing process," and "permanent physical occupations," which are "taking[s] without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#432">458 U.

I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before examining the Court\'s new takings rule, it is worth reviewing what was "taken" in this case.  At issue are about 36 feet of cable one-half inch in diameter and two 4" x 4" x 4" metal boxes.  Jointly, the cable and boxes occupy only about one-eighth of a cubic foot of space on the roof of appellant\'s Manhattan apartment building.  When appellant purchased that building in 1971, the "physical invasion" she now challenges had already occurred. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Appellant did not bring this action until about five years later, demanding 5% of appellee Teleprompter\'s gross revenues from her building, and claiming that the operation of N.Y.Exec.Law \xc2\xa7 828 (McKinney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 458 U. S. 444</a></p><p> Supp.1981-1982) "took" her property.  The New York Supreme Court, the Appellate Division, and the New York Court of Appeals all rejected that claim, upholding \xc2\xa7 828 as a valid exercise of the State\'s police power.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<p>"the State may proscribe a trespass action by landlords generally against a cable TV company which places a cable and other fixtures on the roof of any landlord\'s building, in order to protect the right of the tenants of rental property, who will ultimately have to pay any charge a landlord is permitted to collect from the cable TV company, to obtain TV service in their respective apartments."</p>\n<p>53 N.Y.2d 124, 153, 423 N.E.2d 320, 335 (1981).</p>\n<p>In so ruling, the court applied the multifactor balancing test prescribed by this Court\'s recent Takings Clause decisions.  Those decisions teach that takings questions should be resolved through "essentially <em>ad hoc,</em> factual inquiries," <em>Kaiser Aetna v.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, the court concluded that the statute\'s economic impact on appellant was <em>de minimis,</em> because \xc2\xa7 828 did not affect the fair return on her property.  53 N.Y.2d at 148-150, 423 N.E.2d at 332-333.  Third, the statute did not interfere with appellant\'s reasonable investment-backed expectations.  <em>Id.</em> at 150-151, 423 N.E.2d at 333-334.  When appellant purchased the building, she was unaware of the existence of the cable.  <em>See</em> <l=|458 2|="" 419fn2="" u.s.="">n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  Thus, she could not have invested in the building with any reasonable expectation that the one-eighth cubic foot of space occupied by the cable television installment would become income-productive.  53 N.Y.2d at 155, 423 N.E.2d at 336. </l=|458></p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 458 U.

The Court can escape the result dictated by our recent takings cases only by resorting to bygone precedents and arguing that "permanent physical occupations" somehow differ qualitatively from all other forms of government regulation.</p>\n<p>The Court argues that a <em>per se</em> rule based on "permanent physical occupation" is both historically rooted, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">458 U.

I disagree in both respects.  The 19th-century precedents relied on by the Court lack any vitality outside the agrarian context in which they were decided.

Furthermore, I find logically untenable the Court\'s assertion that \xc2\xa7 828 must be analyzed under a <em>per se</em> rule because it "effectively destroys" three of "the most treasured strands in an owner\'s bundle of property rights," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#435">458 U. S. 435</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s recent Takings Clause decisions teach that nonphysical government intrusions on private property, such as zoning ordinances and other land use restrictions, have become the rule, rather than the exception.  Modern government regulation exudes intangible "externalities" that may diminish the value of private property far more than minor physical touchings.  Nevertheless, as the Court recognizes, it has "often upheld substantial regulation of an owner\'s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">458 U. S. 426</span>.  <em>See, e.g., Agins v. City of Tiburon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a></span> (1980); <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html">438 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/case.html#124">438 U. S. 124</a></span>-125 (1978); <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/case.html">272 U. S. 365</a></span> (1926).</p>\n<p>Precisely because the extent to which the government may injure private interests now depends so little on whether or not it has authorized a "physical contact," the Court has avoided <em>per se</em> takings rules resting on outmoded distinctions between physical and nonphysical intrusions.  As one commentator has observed, a takings rule based on such a distinction is inherently suspect, because "its capacity to distinguish, even crudely, between significant and insignificant losses is too puny to be taken seriously."  Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness:  Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1165, 1227 (1967).</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the Court draws an even finer distinction today -- between "temporary physical invasions" and "permanent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 458 U. S. 448</a></p><p> physical occupations."  When the government authorizes the latter type of intrusion, the Court would find "a taking without regard to the public interests" the regulation may serve.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">458 U. S. 426</span>.  Yet an examination of each of the three words in the Court\'s "permanent physical occupation" formula illustrates that the newly created distinction is even less substantial than the distinction between physical and nonphysical intrusions that the Court already has rejected.</p>\n<p>First, what does the Court mean by "permanent"?  Since all "temporary limitations on the right to exclude" remain "subject to a more complex balancing process to determine whether they are a taking," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#435">458 U. S. 435</a></span>, n. 12, the Court presumably describes a government intrusion that lasts forever.  But as the Court itself concedes, \xc2\xa7 828 does not require appellant to permit the cable installation forever, but only "[s]o long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#439">458 U. S. 439</a></span>.  This is far from "permanent."</p>\n<p>The Court reaffirms that</p>\n<p>"States have broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#440">458 U. S. 440</a></span>.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 828 merely defines one of the many statutory responsibilities that a New Yorker accepts when she enters the rental business.  If appellant occupies her own building, or converts it into a commercial property, she becomes perfectly free to exclude Teleprompter from her one-eighth cubic foot of roof space.  But once appellant chooses to use her property for rental purposes, she must comply with all reasonable government statutes regulating the landlord-tenant relationship. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  If \xc2\xa7 828 authorizes a "permanent" occupation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 458 U. S. 449</a></p><p> and thus works a taking "without regard to the public interests that it may serve," then all other New York statutes that require a landlord to make physical attachments to his rental property also must constitute takings, even if they serve indisputably valid public interests in tenant protection and safety. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court denies that its theory invalidates these statutes, because they "do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#440">458 U. S. 440</a></span>.  But surely this factor cannot be determinative, since the Court simultaneously recognizes that temporary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 458 U. S. 450</a></p><p> invasions by third parties are not subject to a <em>per se</em> rule.  Nor can the qualitative difference arise from the incidental fact that, under \xc2\xa7 828, Teleprompter, rather than appellant or her tenants, owns the cable installation.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#440">458 U. S. 440</a></span>, and n.19.  If anything, \xc2\xa7 828 leaves appellant better off than do other housing statutes, since it ensures that her property will not be damaged aesthetically or physically, <em>see</em> <l=|458 419fn2="" 4|="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>supra,</em> without burdening her with the cost of buying or maintaining the cable.</l=|458></p>\n<p>In any event, under the Court\'s test, the "third party" problem would remain even if appellant herself owned the cable.  So long as Teleprompter continuously passed its electronic signal through the cable, a litigant could argue that the second element of the Court\'s formula -- a "physical touching" by a stranger -- was satisfied, and that \xc2\xa7 828 therefore worked a taking. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Literally read, the Court\'s test opens the door to endless metaphysical struggles over whether or not an individual\'s property has been "physically" touched.  It was precisely to avoid "permit[ting] technicalities of form to dictate consequences of substance," <em>United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/155/case.html">357 U. S. 155</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/155/case.html#181">357 U. S. 181</a></span> (1958) (Harlan, J., dissenting), that the Court abandoned a "physical contacts" test in the first place.</p>\n<p>Third, the Court\'s talismanic distinction between a continuous "occupation" and a transient "invasion" finds no basis in either economic logic or Takings Clause precedent.  In the landlord-tenant context, the Court has upheld against takings challenges rent control statutes permitting "temporary" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 458 U. S. 451</a></p><p> physical invasions of considerable economic magnitude.  <em>See, e.g., Block v. Hirsh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/256/135/case.html">256 U. S. 135</a></span> (1921) (statute permitting tenants to remain in physical possession of their apartments for two years after the termination of their leases).  Moreover, precedents record numerous other "temporary" officially authorized invasions by third parties that have intruded into an owner\'s enjoyment of property far more deeply than did Teleprompter\'s long-unnoticed cable.  <em>See, e.g., PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/74/case.html">447 U. S. 74</a></span> (1980) (leafletting and demonstrating in busy shopping center); <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html">444 U. S. 164</a></span> (1979) (public easement of passage to private pond); <em>United States v. Causby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/256/case.html">328 U. S. 256</a></span> (1946) (noisy airplane flights over private land).  While, under the Court\'s balancing test, some of these "temporary invasions" have been found to be takings, the Court has subjected none of them to the inflexible <em>per se</em> rule now adapted to analyze the far less obtrusive "occupation" at issue in the present case.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#430">458 U. S. 430</a></span>-431,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#432">458 U. S. 432</a></span>-435.</p>\n<p>In sum, history teaches that takings claims are properly evaluated under a multifactor balancing test.  By directing that all "permanent physical occupations" automatically are compensable, "without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#435">458 U. S. 434</a></span>-435, the Court does not further equity so much as it encourages litigants to manipulate their factual allegations to gain the benefit of its <em>per se</em> rule.  <em>Cf.</em> <l=|458 419fn2="" 8|="" u.s.="">n. 8, <em>supra.</em>  I do not relish the prospect of distinguishing the inevitable flow of certiorari petitions attempting to shoehorn insubstantial takings claims into today\'s "set formula."</l=|458></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Setting aside history, the Court also states that the permanent physical occupation authorized by \xc2\xa7 828 is a <em>per se</em> taking because it uniquely impairs appellant\'s powers to dispose of, use, and exclude others from, her property.  <em>See ante</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 458 U. S. 452</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#435">458 U. S. 435</a></span>-438.  In fact, the Court\'s discussion nowhere demonstrates how \xc2\xa7 828 impairs these private rights in a manner <em>qualitatively</em> different from other garden-variety landlord-tenant legislation.</p>\n<p>The Court first contends that the statute impairs appellant\'s legal right to dispose of cable-occupied space by transfer and sale.  But that claim dissolves after a moment\'s reflection.  If someone buys appellant\'s apartment building, but does not use it for rental purposes, that person can have the cable removed, and use the space as he wishes.  In such a case, appellant\'s right to dispose of the space is worth just as much as if \xc2\xa7 828 did not exist.</p>\n<p>Even if another landlord buys appellant\'s building for rental purposes, \xc2\xa7 828 does not render the cable-occupied space valueless.  As a practical matter, the regulation ensures that tenants living in the building will have access to cable television for as long as that building is used for rental purposes, and thereby likely increases both the building\'s resale value and its attractiveness on the rental market. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>In any event, \xc2\xa7 828 differs little from the numerous other New York statutory provisions that require landlords to install physical facilities "permanently occupying" common spaces in or on their buildings.  As the Court acknowledges, the States traditionally -- and constitutionally -- have exercised their police power</p>\n<p>"to require landlords to . . . provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#449">458 U. S. 440</a></span>.  Like \xc2\xa7 828, these provisions merely ensure tenants access to services the legislature deems important, such as water, electricity, natural light, telephones, intercommunication systems, and mail service.  <em>See</em> <l=|458 419fn2="" 7|="" u.s.="">n. 7, <em>supra.</em>  A landlord\'s dispositional rights are affected no more adversely </l=|458></p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 458 U. S. 453</a></p><p> when he sells a building to another landlord subject to \xc2\xa7 828, than when he sells that building subject only to these other New York statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>The Court also suggests that \xc2\xa7 828 unconstitutionally alters appellant\'s right to control the <em>use</em> of her one-eighth cubic foot of roof space.  But other New York multiple dwelling statutes not only oblige landlords to surrender significantly larger portions of common space for their tenants\' use, but also compel the <em>landlord</em> -- rather than the tenants or the private installers -- to pay for and to maintain the equipment.  For example, New York landlords are required by law to provide and pay for mailboxes that occupy more than five times the volume that Teleprompter\'s cable occupies on appellant\'s building.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 443, citing N.Y.Mult.Dwell.Law \xc2\xa7 57 (McKinney 1974).  If the State constitutionally can insist that appellant make this sacrifice so that her tenants may receive mail, it is hard to understand why the State may not require her to surrender less space, <em>filled at another\'s expense,</em> so that those same tenants can receive television signals.</p>\n<p>For constitutional purposes, the relevant question cannot be solely <em>whether</em> the State has interfered in some minimal way with an owner\'s use of space on her building.  Any intelligible takings inquiry must also ask whether the <em>extent</em> of the State\'s interference is so severe as to constitute a compensable taking in light of the owner\'s alternative uses for the property. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Appellant freely admitted that she would have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 458 U. S. 454</a></p><p> had no other use for the cable-occupied space were Teleprompter\'s equipment not on her building.  <em>See</em> App. 97 (Deposition of Jean A. Loretto).</p>\n<p>The Court\'s third and final argument is that \xc2\xa7 828 has deprived appellant of her "power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space" occupied by the cable.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#435">458 U. S. 435</a></span>.  This argument has two flaws.  First, it unjustifiably assumes that appellant\'s tenants have no countervailing property interest in permitting Teleprompter to use that space. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Second, it suggests that the New York Legislature may not exercise its police power to affect appellant\'s common law right to exclude Teleprompter even from one-eighth cubic foot of roof space.  But this Court long ago recognized that new social circumstances can justify legislative modification of a property owner\'s common law rights, without compensation, if the legislative action serves sufficiently important public interests.  <em>See Munn v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/113/case.html">94 U. S. 113</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/113/case.html#134">94 U.

JUSTICE MARSHALL recently and most aptly observed:</p>\n<p>"[Appellant\'s] claim in this case amounts to no less than a suggestion that the common law of trespass is not subject to revision by the State. . . .

Such an approach would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century state of development.  It would allow no room for change in response to changes in circumstance.  The Due Process Clause does not require such a result."</p>\n<p><em>PruneYard Shopping Center v.

Cable television is a new and growing, but somewhat controversial, communications medium.  <em>See</em> Brief for New York State Cable Television Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7 (about 25% of American homes with televisions -- approximately 20 million families currently subscribe to cable television, with the penetration rate expected to double by 1990).

N.Y.Exec.Law \xc2\xa7 828(1)(b) (McKinney Supp.1982).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In my view, the fact that \xc2\xa7 828 incidentally protects so-called "crossover" wires that do not currently serve tenants, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#422">458 U. S. 422</a></span>, n. 2, does not affect \xc2\xa7 828\'s fundamental character as a piece of landlord-tenant legislation.  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#422">458 U. S. 422</a></span>, crossovers are crucial links in the cable "highway," and represent the simplest and most economical way to provide service to tenants in a group of buildings in close proximity.  Like the Court, I find "no constitutional difference between a crossover and a noncrossover installation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#438">458 U. S. 438</a></span>.  Even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the crossover extension in this case works a taking, I would be prepared to hold that the incremental governmental intrusion caused by that 4- to 6-foot wire, which occupies the cubic volume of a child\'s building block, is a <em>de minimis</em> deprivation entitled to no compensation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Mult.Dwell.Law \xc2\xa7 35 (McKinney 1974) (requiring entrance doors and lights); \xc2\xa7 36 (windows and skylights for public halls and stairs); \xc2\xa7 50-a (Supp.1982) (locks and intercommunication systems); \xc2\xa7 50-c (lobby attendants); \xc2\xa7 51-a (peepholes); \xc2\xa7 51-b (elevator mirrors); \xc2\xa7 53 (fire escapes); \xc2\xa7 57 (bells and mail receptacles); \xc2\xa7 67(3) (fire sprinklers).  <em>See also Queenside Hills Realty Co. v. Saxl,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/80/case.html">328 U. S. 80</a></span> (1946) (upholding constitutionality of New York fire sprinkler provision).</p>\n<p>These statutes specify in far greater detail than \xc2\xa7 828 what types of physical facilities a New York landlord must provide his tenants and where he must provide them.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Mult.Dwell.Law \xc2\xa7 75 (McKinney 1974) (owners of multiple dwellings must provide "proper appliances to receive and distribute an adequate supply of water," including "a proper sink with running water and with a two-inch waste and trap"); \xc2\xa7 35 (owners of multiple dwellings with frontage exceeding 22 feet must provide "at least two lights, one at each side of the entrance way, with an aggregate illumination of one hundred fifty watts or equivalent illumination"); \xc2\xa7 50-a(2) (Supp.1981-1982) (owners of Class A multiple dwellings must provide intercommunication system "located at an automatic self-locking door giving public access to the main entrance hall or lobby").</p>\n<p>Apartment building rooftops are not exempted.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 62 (landlords must place parapet walls and guardrails on their roofs "three feet six inches or more in height above the level of such area").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, appellant\'s counsel made precisely this claim at oral argument.  Urging the rule which the Court now adopts, appellant\'s counsel suggested that a taking would result even if appellant owned the cable.</p>\n<p>"[T]he precise location of the easement [taken by Teleprompter changes] from the surface of the roof to inside the wire. . . .  [T]he wire itself is owned by the landlord, but the cable company has the right to pass its signal through the wire without compensation to the landlord, for its commercial benefit."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>In her pretrial deposition, appellant conceded not only that owners of other apartment buildings thought that the cable\'s presence had enhanced the market value of their buildings, App. 102-103, but also that her own tenants would have been upset if the cable connection had been removed.  <em>Id.</em> at 107, 108, 110.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>For this reason, the Court provides no support for its <em>per se</em> rule by asserting that the State could not require landlords, without compensation, "to permit third parties to install swimming pools," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#436">458 U.

S. 439</a></span>, n. 17, for the convenience of tenants.  Presumably, these more intrusive government regulations would create difficult takings problems even under our traditional balancing approach.  Depending on the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and the degree to which it interfered with an owner\'s reasonable investment-backed expectations, among other things, the Court\'s hypothetical examples might or might not constitute takings.  These examples hardly prove, however, that a permanent physical occupation that works a <em>de minimis</em> interference with a private property interest is a taking <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>It is far from clear that, under New York law, appellant\'s tenants would lack all property interests in the few square inches on the exterior of the building to which Teleprompter\'s cable and hardware attach.  Under modern landlord-tenant law, a residential tenancy is not merely a possessory interest in specified space, but also a contract for the provision of a package of services and facilities necessary and appurtenant to that space.  <em>See</em> R. Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant \xc2\xa7 3:14 (1980).  A modern urban tenant\'s leasehold often includes not only contractual, but also statutory, rights, including the rights to an implied warranty of habitability, rent control, and such services as the landlord is obliged by statute to provide.  <em>Cf.</em> <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>Happily, the Court leaves open the question whether \xc2\xa7 828 provides landlords like appellant sufficient compensation for their actual losses.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/case.html#441">458 U. S. 441</a></span>.  Since the State Cable Television Commission\'s regulations permit higher than nominal awards if a landlord makes "a special showing of greater damages," App. 52, the concurring opinion in the New York Court of Appeals found that the statute awards just compensation.  <em>See</em> 53 N.Y.2d at 155, 423 N.E.2d at 336 ("[I]t is obvious that a landlord who actually incurs damage to his property or is restricted in the use to which he might put that property will receive compensation commensurate with the greater injury").  If, after the remand following today\'s decision, this minor physical invasion is declared to be a taking deserving little or no compensation, the net result will have been a large expenditure of judicial resources on a constitutional claim of little moment.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
