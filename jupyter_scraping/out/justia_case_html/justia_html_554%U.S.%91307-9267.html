He waived \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all appellate issues that might have been available if he had exercised his right to trial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but reserved the right to appeal the validity of his guilty plea.  See No: 06C1304, Memorandum Opinion and Order (ED Ill., May 2, 2006), App. B to Pet. for Cert. 3.  Petitioner nonetheless (allegedly) asked his attorney to file a notice of appeal to argue that the substance he distributed was not crack cocaine.  His attorney filed nothing.  On collateral review, petitioner claimed that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failure was ineffective assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied the claim, finding that any appeal his attorney might have pursued was doomed because he waived his right to appeal and because petitioner had expressly identified the substance as crack cocaine in his guilty plea.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals asked the parties to address the effect of its decision in <em>Nunez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 495 F.\xc2\xa03d 544 (CA7 2007), which held that Nunez\xe2\x80\x99s plea agreement waived his right to bring an identical ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review.  The Government argued that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case was materially indistinguishable from <em>Nunez</em>.  The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner asks us to consider his ineffective-assistance claim.  That claim does not warrant our review, so I would deny his petition for certiorari.  In the Brief for United States, the Solicitor General suggests that we GVR\xe2\x80\x94grant the petition, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals.  He contends (contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position below) that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s waiver is less comprehensive than the waiver in <em>Nunez</em>.  And since he thinks that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the waiver in <em>Nunez</em> was wrong (he has asked us to GVR in Nunez\xe2\x80\x99s case for that very reason), the Solicitor General concludes that, inasmuch as the Court of Appeals might have agreed with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s (now repudiated) position below, the reasoning behind the judgment below may be wrong.  The Solicitor General does not challenge the <em>judgment</em> below, nor does he take a position on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim, insofar as that may have been the basis for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 summary order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I state in my dissent in <em>Nunez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at ___, the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s confession of error in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, but not its judgment, does not justify entry of a GVR order.  That disposition is especially inappropriate in this case because we cannot even be sure that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 summary order was premised on the alleged error.  See <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Chater</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/163/index.html">516 U. S. 163</a>, 184\xe2\x80\x93186 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  For all we know, the Court of Appeals identified a difference in the plea agreements and therefore summarily affirmed because it agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning on the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962772">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n554 U.
