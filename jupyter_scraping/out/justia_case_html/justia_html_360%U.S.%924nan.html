Counsel are requested to address themselves to the following questions among others: </p><ul>\'(1) Is the Membership Clause of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. 2385, 18 U.S.C.A. 2385, valid under the Constitution of the United States if it be interpreted to permit a conviction based only on proof that the accused was a member of a society, group or assembly of persons described in the Act knowing the purposes thereof?</ul> <ul>\'(2) If not, is the Membership Clause constitutionally valid if interpreted as also requiring proof that the membership was accompanied by a specific intent of the accused to accomplish those purposes as speedily as circumstances would permit? Does the Smith Act permissibly bear such an interpretation?</ul> <ul>\'(3) If the Membership Clause would not be constitutionally valid as interpreted under (1) or (2), would the clause be constitutionally valid if interpreted as requiring as an element of the crime proof that the accused was an \'active\' member? Does the Smith Act permissibly bear such an interpretation? If not, and if the clause be valid without such element, does a constitutional application of the Membership Clause depend upon any such requirement, and if so was such a requirement properly applied by the courts in this case? <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="925">Page 360 U.S. 924 , 925</a></p><p> \'(4) Whether the \'clear and present danger\' doctrine, as interpreted by counsel, has application to the Membership Clause, either with respect to the accused or with respect to the \'society, group, or assembly of persons\' described in the statute.

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] Involved is the validity of the clause in the Smith Act having to do with membership in the Communist Party. </p><p> The case first came here over three years ago. Certiorari was originally granted on March 26, 1956, 350 U.S. 992. After oral argument, the case was restored tothe docket and ordered to be reargued, 353 U.S. 979. Prior to reargument, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum suggesting remand for a new trial under our intervening ruling in Jencks v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/353/657/case.html">353 U.S. 657</a>. This was done, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/1/case.html">355 U.S. 1</a>d 19.
