S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 damages action in federal court, alleging that petitioners, the officers who supervised and conducted the warrantless search of the premises that led to his arrest after the sale, had violated the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the officers.  Noting that other courts had adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent-once-removed\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine\xe2\x80\x94which permits a warrantless police entry into a home when consent to enter has already been granted to an undercover officer who has observed contraband in plain view\xe2\x80\x94the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they could reasonably have believed that the doctrine authorized their conduct.  Following the procedure mandated in <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, the Tenth Circuit held that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity.  The court disapproved broadening the consent-once-removed doctrine to situations in which the person granted initial consent was not an undercover officer, but merely an informant.  It further held that the Fourth Amendment right to be free in one\xe2\x80\x99s home from unreasonable searches and arrests was clearly established at the time of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, and determined that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s clearly established precedents, warrantless entries into a home are <em>per se</em> unreasonable unless they satisfy one of the two established exceptions for consent and exigent circumstances.  The court concluded that petitioners could not reasonably have believed that their conduct was lawful because they knew that (1) they had no warrant; (2) respondent had not consented to their entry; and (3) his consent to the entry of an informant could not reasonably be interpreted to extend to them.  In granting certiorari, this Court directed the parties to address whether <em>Saucier</em> should be overruled in light of widespread criticism directed at it.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Saucier</em> procedure should not be regarded as an inflexible requirement.

S., at 194, a two-step sequence for resolving government officials\xe2\x80\x99 qualified immunity claims: A court must decide (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) if so, whether that right was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct, <em>id</em>., at 201.  Qualified immunity applies unless the official\'s conduct violated such a right.  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 640.

Revisiting precedent is particularly appropriate where, as here, a departure would not upset settled expectations, see,<em> e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Gaudin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/506/index.html">515 U. S. 506</a>, 521; the precedent consists of a rule that is judge-made and adopted to improve court operations, not a statute promulgated by Congress, see,<em> e.g., State Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Khan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/3/index.html">522 U. S. 3</a>, 20<em>; </em>and the precedent has \xe2\x80\x9cbeen questioned by Members of th[is] Court in later decisions, and [has] defied consistent application by the lower courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U. S. 808</a>, 829\xe2\x80\x93830.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Saucier</em> should not be reconsidered unless the Court concludes that it was \xe2\x80\x9cbadly reasoned\xe2\x80\x9d or that its rule has proved \xe2\x80\x9cunworkable,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Payne, supra</em>, at 827, is rejected.  Those standards are out of place in the present context, where a considerable body of new experience supports a determination that a mandatory, two-step rule for resolving all qualified immunity claims should not be retained.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Reconsideration of the <em>Saucier</em> procedure demonstrates that, while the sequence set forth therein is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory in all cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The Court continues to recognize that the <em>Saucier</em> protocol is often beneficial.  In some cases, a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law may make it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all.  And <em>Saucier</em> was correct in noting that the two-step procedure promotes the development of constitutional precedent and is especially valuable for questions that do not frequently arise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is unavailable.  See 533 U. S., at 194.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, experience in this Court and the lower federal courts has pointed out the rigid <em>Saucier</em> procedure\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings.  For example, it may result in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, and waste the parties\xe2\x80\x99 resources by forcing them to assume the costs of litigating constitutional questions and endure delays attributable to resolving those questions when the suit otherwise could be disposed of more readily.  Moreover, although the procedure\xe2\x80\x99s first prong is intended to further the development of constitutional precedent, opinions following that procedure often fail to make a meaningful contribution to such development, as where, <em>e.g.,</em> a court of appeals decision is issued in an opinion marked as not precedential.  Further, when qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage, the answer to whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.  And the first step may create a risk of bad decisionmaking, as where the briefing of constitutional questions is woefully inadequate.  Application of the <em>Saucier</em> rule also may make it hard for affected parties to obtain appellate review of constitutional decisions having a serious prospective effect on their operations.  For example, where a court holds that a defendant has committed a constitutional violation, but then holds that the violation was not clearly established, the defendant, as the winning party, may have his right to appeal the adverse constitutional holding challenged.  Because rigid adherence to <em>Saucier </em>departs from the general rule of constitutional avoidance, cf., <em>e.g., Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 388, the Court may appropriately decline to mandate the order of decision that the lower courts must follow, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 697.  This flexibility properly reflects the Court\xe2\x80\x99s respect for the lower federal courts.  Because the two-step <em>Saucier</em> procedure is often, but not always, advantageous, those judges are in the best position to determine the order of decisionmaking that will best facilitate the fair and efficient disposition of each case.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Misgivings concerning today\xe2\x80\x99s decision are unwarranted.  It does not prevent the lower courts from following <em>Saucier;</em> it simply recognizes that they should have the discretion to decide whether that procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.  Moreover, it will not retard the development of constitutional law, result in a proliferation of damages claims against local governments, or spawn new litigation over the standards for deciding whether to reach the particular case\xe2\x80\x99s merits.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of the search that their conduct was unconstitutional.  When the entry occurred, the consent-once-removed doctrine had been accepted by two State Supreme Courts and three Federal Courts of Appeals, and not one of the latter had issued a contrary decision.  Petitioners were entitled to rely on these cases, even though their own Federal Circuit had not yet ruled on consent-once-removed entries.

Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, against state law enforcement officers who conducted a warrantless search of his house incident to his arrest for the sale of methamphetamine to an undercover informant whom he had voluntarily admitted to the premises.  The Court of Appeals held that petitioners were not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  Following the procedure we mandated in <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a> (2001), the Court of Appeals held, first, that respondent adduced facts sufficient to make out a violation of the Fourth Amendment and, second, that the unconstitutionality of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was clearly established.  In granting review, we required the parties to address the additional question whether the mandatory procedure set out in <em>Saucier</em> should be retained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now hold that the <em>Saucier</em> procedure should not be regarded as an inflexible requirement and that petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that it was not clearly established at the time of the search that their conduct was unconstitutional.  We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Central Utah Narcotics Task Force is charged with investigating illegal drug use and sales.  In 2002, Brian Bartholomew, who became an informant for the task force after having been charged with the unlawful possession of methamphetamine, informed Officer Jeffrey Whatcott that respondent Afton Callahan had arranged to sell Bartholomew methamphetamine later that day.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That evening, Bartholomew arrived at respondent\xe2\x80\x99s residence at about 8 p.m.  Once there, Bartholomew went inside and confirmed that respondent had methamphetamine available for sale.  Bartholomew then told respondent that he needed to obtain money to make his purchase and left.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bartholomew met with members of the task force at about 9 p.m. and told them that he would be able to buy a gram of methamphetamine for $100.  After concluding that Bartholomew was capable of completing the planned purchase, the officers searched him, determined that he had no controlled substances on his person, gave him a marked $100 bill and a concealed electronic transmitter to monitor his conversations, and agreed on a signal that he would give after completing the purchase.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officers drove Bartholomew to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trailer home, and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s daughter let him inside.  Respondent then retrieved a large bag containing methamphetamine from his freezer and sold Bartholomew a gram of methamphetamine, which he put into a small plastic bag.  Bartholomew gave the arrest signal to the officers who were monitoring the conversation, and they entered the trailer through a porch door.  In the enclosed porch, the officers encountered Bartholomew, respondent, and two other persons, and they saw respondent drop a plastic bag, which they later determined contained methamphetamine.  The officers then conducted a protective sweep\nof the premises.  In addition to the large bag of meth-\namphetamine, the officers recovered the marked bill\nfrom respondent and a small bag containing meth-\namphetamine from Bartholomew, and they found drug syringes in the residence.  As a result, respondent was charged with the unlawful possession and distribution of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court held that the warrantless arrest and search were supported by exigent circumstances.  On respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from his conviction, the Utah attorney general conceded the absence of exigent circumstances, but urged that the inevitable discovery doctrine justified introduction of the fruits of the warrantless search.  The Utah Court of Appeals disagreed and vacated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, 2004 LIT App. 164, 93 P.\xc2\xa03d 103.  Respondent then brought this damages action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth Amendment by entering his home without a warrant.  See <em>Callahan</em> v. <em>Millard Cty.</em>, No. 2:04\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300952, 2006 WL 1409130 (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In granting the officers\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment, the District Court noted that other courts had adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent-once-removed\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, which permits a warrantless entry by police officers into a home when consent to enter has already been granted to an undercover officer or informant who has observed contraband in plain view.  Believing that this doctrine was in tension with our intervening decision in <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/103/index.html">547 U. S. 103</a> (2006), the District Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe simplest approach is to assume that the Supreme Court will ultimately reject the [consent-once-removed] doctrine and find that searches such as the one in this case are not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  2006 WL 1409130, at *8.  The Court then held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they could reasonably have believed that the consent-once-removed doctrine authorized their conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a divided panel of the Tenth Circuit held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights.  <em>Callahan</em> v. <em>Millard Cty.</em>, 494 F.\xc2\xa03d 891, 895\xe2\x80\x93899 (2007).  The panel majority stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he \xe2\x80\x98consent-once-removed\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine applies when an undercover officer enters a house at the express invitation of someone with authority to consent, establishes probable cause to arrest or search, and then immediately summons other officers for assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 896.  The majority took no issue with application of the doctrine when the initial consent was granted to an undercover law enforcement officer, but the majority disagreed with decisions that \xe2\x80\x9cbroade[n] this doctrine to grant informants the same capabilities as undercover officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit panel further held that the Fourth Amendment right that it recognized was clearly established at the time of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  <em>Id</em>., at 898\xe2\x80\x93899.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn this case,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant right is the right to be free in one\xe2\x80\x99s home from unreasonable searches and arrests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 898.  The Court determined that, under the clearly established precedents of this Court and the Tenth Circuit, \xe2\x80\x9cwarrantless entries into a home are per se unreasonable unless they satisfy the established exceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 898\xe2\x80\x93899.  In the panel\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have clearly established that to allow police entry into a home, the only two exceptions to the warrant requirement are consent and exigent circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 899.  Against that backdrop, the panel concluded, petitioners could not reasonably have believed that their conduct was lawful because petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cknew (1) they had no warrant; (2) [respondent] had not consented to their entry; and (3) [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] consent to the entry of an informant could not reasonably be interpreted to extend to them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In dissent, Judge Kelly argued that \xe2\x80\x9cno constitutional violation occurred in this case\xe2\x80\x9d because, by inviting Bartholomew into his house and participating in a narcotics transaction there, respondent had compromised the privacy of the residence and had assumed the risk that Bartholomew would reveal their dealings to the police.  <em>Id</em>., at 903.  Judge Kelly further concluded that, even if petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct had been unlawful, they were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity because the constitutional right at issue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be free from the warrantless entry of police officers into one\xe2\x80\x99s home to effectuate an arrest after one has granted voluntary, consensual entry to a confidential informant and undertaken criminal activity giving rise to probable cause\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the events in question.  <em>Id</em>., at 903\xe2\x80\x93904.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, the Court of Appeals followed the <em>Saucier</em> procedure.  The <em>Saucier</em> procedure has been criticized by Members of this Court and by lower court judges, who have been required to apply the procedure in a great variety of cases and thus have much firsthand experience bearing on its advantages and disadvantages.  Accordingly, in granting certiorari, we directed the parties to address the question whether <em>Saucier</em> should be overruled.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials \xe2\x80\x9cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html"></a><a href="/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 818 (1982).  Qualified immunity balances two important interests\xe2\x80\x94the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.  The protection of qualified immunity applies regardless of whether the government official\xe2\x80\x99s error is \xe2\x80\x9ca mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Groh</em> v. <em>Ramirez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/551/index.html">540 U. S. 551</a>, 567 (2004) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Butz</em> v. <em>Economou</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/index.html">438 U. S. 478</a>, 507 (1978) (noting that qualified immunity covers \xe2\x80\x9cmere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one of law\xe2\x80\x9d)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because qualified immunity is \xe2\x80\x9can immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability \xe2\x80\xa6 it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 526 (1985) (emphasis deleted).  Indeed, we have made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cdriving force\xe2\x80\x9d behind creation of the qualified immunity doctrine was a desire to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98insubstantial claims\xe2\x80\x99 against government officials [will] be resolved prior to discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 640, n.\xc2\xa02 (1987).  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hunter</em> v. <em>Bryant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/224/index.html">502 U. S. 224</a>, 227 (1991) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Saucier,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, this Court mandated a two-step sequence for resolving government officials\xe2\x80\x99 qualified immunity claims.  First, a court must decide whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged (see Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), (c)) or shown (see Rules 50, 56) make out a violation of a constitutional right.  533 U. S., at 201.  Second, if the plaintiff has satisfied this first step, the court must decide whether the right at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Qualified immunity is applicable unless the official\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right.  <em>Anderson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 640.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decisions prior to <em>Saucier</em> had held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe better approach to resolving cases in which the defense of qualified immunity is raised is to determine first whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Sacramento</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, 841, n.\xc2\xa05 (1998).  <em>Saucier</em> made that suggestion a mandate.  For the first time, we held that whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts alleged show the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a constitutional right \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>must</em> be the initial inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d in every qualified immunity case.  533 U.

Only after completing this first step, we said, may a court turn to \xe2\x80\x9cthe next, sequential step,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the right was clearly established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This two-step procedure, the <em>Saucier</em> Court reasoned, is necessary to support the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celaboration from case to case\xe2\x80\x9d and to prevent constitutional stagnation.  <em>Ibid</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe law might be deprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the officer\'s conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In considering whether the <em>Saucier </em>procedure should be modified or abandoned, we must begin with the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>.  <em>Stare decisis</em> \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U.

Like rules governing procedures and the admission of evidence in the trial courts, <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-step protocol does not affect the way in which parties order their affairs.  Withdrawing from <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rule would not upset settled expectations on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s part.  See<em> United States</em> v. <em>Gaudin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/506/index.html">515 U.

Because of the basis and the nature of the <em>Saucier </em>two-step protocol, it is sufficient that we now have a considerable body of new experience to consider regarding the consequences of requiring adherence to this inflexible procedure.  This experience supports our present determination that a mandatory, two-step rule for resolving all qualified immunity claims should not be retained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lower court judges, who have had the task of applying the <em>Saucier</em> rule on a regular basis for the past eight years, have not been reticent in their criticism of <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crigid order of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Purtell</em> v. <em>Mason</em>, 527 F.\xc2\xa03d 615, 622 (CA7 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis \xe2\x80\x98rigid order of battle\xe2\x80\x99 has been criticized on practical, procedural, and substantive grounds\xe2\x80\x9d); Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U.

Collectively, the factors we have noted make our present reevaluation of the <em>Saucier</em> two-step protocol appropriate.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On reconsidering the procedure required in <em>Saucier</em>, we conclude that, while the sequence set forth there is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory.  The judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we now hold that the <em>Saucier</em> protocol should not be regarded as mandatory in all cases, we continue to recognize that it is often beneficial.  For one thing, there are cases in which there would be little if any conservation of judicial resources to be had by beginning and ending with a discussion of the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d prong.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t often may be difficult to decide whether a right is clearly established without deciding precisely what the constitutional right happens to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lyons </em>v.<em> Xenia</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 565, 581 (CA6 2005) (Sutton, J., concurring).  In some cases, a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law may make it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all.  In addition, the <em>Saucier</em> Court was certainly correct in noting that the two-step procedure promotes the development of constitutional precedent and is especially valu-\nable with respect to questions that do not frequently\narise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is unavailable.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, however, the rigid <em>Saucier</em> procedure comes with a price.  The procedure sometimes results in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.  There are cases in which it is plain that a constitutional right is not clearly established but far from obvious whether in fact there is such a right.  District courts and courts of appeals with heavy caseloads are often understandably unenthusiastic about what may seem to be an essentially academic exercise. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unnecessary litigation of constitutional issues also wastes the parties\xe2\x80\x99 resources.  Qualified immunity is \xe2\x80\x9can immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell,</em> 472 U. S., at 526 (emphasis deleted).  <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-step protocol \xe2\x80\x9cdisserve[s] the purpose of qualified immunity\xe2\x80\x9d when it \xe2\x80\x9cforces the parties to endure additional burdens of suit\xe2\x80\x94such as the costs of litigating constitutional questions and delays attributable to resolving them\xe2\x80\x94when the suit otherwise could be disposed of more readily.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Nat. Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 30.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the first prong of the <em>Saucier</em> procedure is intended to further the development of constitutional precedent, opinions following that procedure often fail to make a meaningful contribution to such development.  For one thing,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0there are cases in which the constitutional question is so fact-bound that the decision provides little guidance for future cases.  See <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 388 (2007) (Breyer, J., concurring) (counseling against the <em>Saucier</em> two-step protocol where the question is \xe2\x80\x9cso fact dependent that the result will be confusion rather than clarity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Maine,</em> 469 F.\xc2\xa03d 158, 168 (CA1 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not think the law elaboration purpose will be well served here, where the Fourth Amendment inquiry involves a reasonableness question which is highly idiosyncratic and heavily dependent on the facts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A decision on the underlying constitutional question in a \xc2\xa71983 damages action or a <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971),[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] action may have scant value when it appears that the question will soon be decided by a higher court.  When presented with a constitutional question on which this Court had just granted certiorari, the Ninth Circuit elected to \xe2\x80\x9cbypass <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em>s</em> first step and decide only whether [the alleged right] was clearly established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Motley</em> v. <em>Parks</em>, 432 F.\xc2\xa03d 1072, 1078, and n.\xc2\xa05 (2005) (en banc).  Similar considerations may come into play when a court of appeals panel confronts a constitutional question that is pending before the court en banc or when a district court encounters a constitutional question that is before the court of appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A constitutional decision resting on an uncertain interpretation of state law is also of doubtful precedential importance.  As a result, several courts have identified an \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d to the <em>Saucier</em> rule for cases in which resolution of the constitutional question requires clarification of an ambiguous state statute.  <em>Egolf</em> v. <em>Witmer</em>, 526 F.\xc2\xa03d 104, 109\xe2\x80\x93111 (CA3 2008); accord, <em>Tremblay</em> v. <em>McClellan</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d 195, 200 (CA1 2003); <em>Ehrlich</em> v. <em>Glastonbury</em>, 348 F.\xc2\xa03d 48, 57\xe2\x80\x9360 (CA2 2003).  Justifying the decision to grant qualified immunity to the defendant without first resolving, under <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first prong, whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated the Constitution, these courts have observed that <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying principle\xe2\x80\x9d of encouraging federal courts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future \xe2\x80\x9cis not meaningfully advanced \xe2\x80\xa6 when the definition of constitutional rights depends on a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain assumptions about state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Egolf</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 110; accord, <em>Tremblay</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 200; <em>Ehrlich</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage, the precise factual basis for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim or claims may be hard to identify.  See <em>Lyons,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 582 (Sutton, J., concurring); <em>Kwai Fun Wong</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 373 F.\xc2\xa03d 952, 957 (CA9 2004); <em>Mollica</em> v. <em>Volker</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d 366, 374 (CA2 2000).  Accordingly, several courts have recognized that the two-step inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cis an uncomfortable exercise where \xe2\x80\xa6 the answer [to] whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed\xe2\x80\x9d and have suggested that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t may be that <em>Saucier</em> was not strictly intended to cover\xe2\x80\x9d this situation.  <em>Dirrane</em> v. <em>Brookline Police Dept.</em>, 315 F.\xc2\xa03d 65, 69\xe2\x80\x9370 (CA1 2002); see also <em>Robinette</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 476 F.\xc2\xa03d 585, 592, n.\xc2\xa08 (CA8 2007) (declining to follow <em>Saucier</em> because \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties have provided very few facts to define and limit any holding\xe2\x80\x9d on the constitutional question).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are circumstances in which the first step of the <em>Saucier</em> procedure may create a risk of bad decisionmaking.  The lower courts sometimes encounter cases in which the briefing of constitutional questions is woefully inadequate.  See <em>Lyons,</em> 417 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582 (Sutton, J., concurring) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9crisk that constitutional questions may be prematurely and incorrectly decided in cases where they are not well presented\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Mollica,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 374.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the <em>Saucier</em> rule prescribes the sequence in which the issues must be discussed by a court in its opinion, the rule  does not\xe2\x80\x94and obviously cannot\xe2\x80\x94specify the sequence in which judges reach their conclusions in their own internal thought processes.  Thus, there will be cases in which a court will rather quickly and easily decide that there was no violation of clearly established law before turning to the more difficult question whether the relevant facts make out a constitutional question at all.  In such situations, there is a risk that a court may not devote as much care as it would in other circumstances to the decision of the constitutional issue.  See <em>Horne</em> v. <em>Coughlin</em>, 191 F.\xc2\xa03d, 244, 247 (CA2 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudges risk being insufficiently thoughtful and cautious in uttering pronouncements that play no role in their adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d); Leval 1278\xe2\x80\x931279.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rigid adherence to the <em>Saucier</em> rule may make it hard for affected parties to obtain appellate review of constitutional decisions that may have a serious prospective effect on their operations.  Where a court holds that a defendant committed a constitutional violation but that the violation was not clearly established, the defendant may face a difficult situation.  As the winning party, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to appeal the adverse holding on the constitutional question may be contested.  See <em>Bunting,</em> 541 U. S., at 1025 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe perception of unreviewability undermines adherence to the sequencing rule we . . . created\xe2\x80\x9d in Saucier);[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] see also <em>Kalka</em> v. <em>Hawk</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 90, 96, n.\xc2\xa09 (CADC 2000) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ormally, a party may not appeal from a favorable judgment\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9chas apparently never granted the certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appellate court\xe2\x80\x9d).  In cases like <em>Bunting</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing\xe2\x80\x9d defendant faces an unenviable choice: \xe2\x80\x9ccompl[y] with the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s advisory dictum without opportunity to seek appellate [or certiorari] review,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdef[y] the views of the lower court, adher[e] to practices that have been declared illegal, and thus invit[e] new suits\xe2\x80\x9d and potential \xe2\x80\x9cpunitive damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Horne, supra, </em>at 247\xe2\x80\x93248.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adherence to <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-step protocol departs from the general rule of constitutional avoidance and runs counter to the \xe2\x80\x9colder, wiser judicial counsel \xe2\x80\x98not to pass on questions of constitutionality \xe2\x80\xa6 unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott, </em>550 U. S., at 388 (Breyer, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>McLaughlin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/101/index.html">323 U. S. 101</a>, 105 (1944)); see <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other analogous contexts, we have appropriately declined to mandate the order of decision that the lower courts must follow.  For example, in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), we recognized a two-part test for determining whether a criminal defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel: The defendant must demonstrate (1) that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance fell below what could be expected of a reasonably competent practitioner; and (2) that he was prejudiced by that substandard performance.  <em>Id</em>., at 687.  After setting forth and applying the analytical framework that courts must use in evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we left it to the sound discretion of lower courts to determine the order of decision.  <em>Id</em>., at 697 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we have discussed the performance component of an ineffectiveness claim prior to the prejudice component, there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984), we created an exception to the exclusionary rule when officers reasonably rely on a facially valid search warrant.  <em>Id</em>., at 913.  In that context, we recognized that a defendant challenging a search will lose if either: (1) the warrant issued was supported by probable cause; or (2) it was not, but the officers executing it reasonably believed that it was.  Again, after setting forth and applying the analytical framework that courts must use in evaluating the good-faith exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, we left it to the sound discretion of the lower courts to determine the order of decision.  <em>Id</em>., at 924, 925 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for courts to adopt the inflexible practice of always deciding whether the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct manifested objective good faith before turning to the question whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This flexibility properly reflects our respect for the lower federal courts that bear the brunt of adjudicating these cases.  Because the two-step <em>Saucier</em> procedure is often, but not always, advantageous, the judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals are in the best position to determine the  order of decisionmaking will best facilitate the fair and efficient disposition of each case.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any misgivings concerning our decision to withdraw from the mandate set forth in <em>Saucier</em> are unwarranted.  Our decision does not prevent the lower courts from following the <em>Saucier</em> procedure; it simply recognizes that those courts should have the discretion to decide whether that procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.  Moreover, the development of constitutional law is by no means entirely dependent on cases in which the defendant may seek qualified immunity.  Most of the constitutional issues that are presented in \xc2\xa71983 damages actions and <em>Bivens </em>cases also arise in cases in which that defense is not available, such as criminal cases and \xc2\xa71983 cases against a municipality, as well as \xc2\xa71983 cases against individuals where injunctive relief is sought instead of or in addition to damages.  See <em>Lewis</em>, 523 U. S., at 841, n.\xc2\xa05 (noting that qualified immunity is unavailable \xe2\x80\x9cin a suit to enjoin future conduct, in an action against a municipality, or in litigating a suppression motion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also do not think that relaxation of <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is likely to result in a proliferation of damages claims against local governments.  Compare Brief for Nat.

It is hard to see how the <em>Saucier </em>procedure could have a significant effect on a civil rights plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to seek damages only from a municipal employee or also from the municipality.  Whether the <em>Saucier</em> procedure is mandatory or discretionary, the plaintiff will presumably take into account the possibility that the individual defendant will be held to have qualified immunity, and presumably the plaintiff will seek damages from the municipality as well as the individual employee if the benefits of doing so (any increase in the likelihood of recovery or collection of damages) outweigh the litigation costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we think that allowing the lower courts to exercise their discretion with respect to the <em>Saucier</em> procedure will spawn \xe2\x80\x9ca new cottage industry of litigation \xe2\x80\xa6 over the standards for deciding whether to reach the merits in a given case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Nat. Assn. of Counties et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 29, 30.  It does not appear that such a \xe2\x80\x9ccottage industry\xe2\x80\x9d developed prior to <em>Saucier</em>, and we see no reason why our decision today should produce such a result.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the conduct of the officers here, we hold that petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because the entry did not violate clearly established law.  An officer conducting a search is entitled to qualified immunity where clearly established law does not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.  See  <em>Anderson,</em> 483 U. S., at 641.  This inquiry turns on the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective legal reasonableness of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U.

This doctrine had been considered by three Federal Courts of Appeals and two State Supreme Courts starting in the early 1980\xe2\x80\x99s.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Diaz</em>, 814 F.\xc2\xa02d 454, 459 (CA7), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/857/index.html">484 U.

S. 999</a> (2000); <em>State</em> v. <em>Henry</em>, 133 N.\xc2\xa0J. 104, 627 A.\xc2\xa02d 125 (1993); <em>State</em> v. <em>Johnston</em>, 184 Wis. 2d 794, 518 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 759 (1994).  It had been accepted by every one of those courts.  Moreover, the Seventh Circuit had approved the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s application to cases involving consensual entries by private citizens acting as confidential informants.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Paul</em>, 808 F.\xc2\xa02d, 645, 648 (1986).  The Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion after the events that gave rise to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Yoon</em>, 398 F.\xc2\xa03d 802, 806\xe2\x80\x93808,  cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/977/index.html">546 U. S. 977</a> (2005), and prior to the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the present case, no court of appeals had issued a contrary decision.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officers here were entitled to rely on these cases, even though their own Federal Circuit had not yet ruled on \xe2\x80\x9cconsent-once-removed\xe2\x80\x9d entries.  The principles of qualified immunity shield an officer from personal liability when an officer reasonably believes that his or her conduct complies with the law.  Police officers are entitled to rely on existing lower court cases without facing personal liability for their actions.  In <em>Wilson,</em> we explained that a Circuit split on the relevant issue had developed after the events that gave rise to suit and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U. S., at 618.  Likewise, here, where the divergence of views on the consent-once-removed doctrine was created by the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, it is improper to subject petitioners to money damages for their conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the unlawfulness of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct in this case was not clearly established, petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity.
