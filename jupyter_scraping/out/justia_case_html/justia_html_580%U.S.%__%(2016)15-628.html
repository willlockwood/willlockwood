These persons are also forbidden from tipping inside information to others for trading.  A tippee who receives such information with the knowledge that its disclosure breached the tipper\xe2\x80\x99s duty acquires that duty and may be liable for securities fraud for any undisclosed trading on the information.  In <i>Dirks</i> v. <i>SEC</i>,463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646, this Court explained that tippee liability hinges on whether the tipper\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure breaches a fiduciary duty, which occurs when the tipper discloses the information for a personal benefit.  The Court also held that a personal benefit may be inferred where the tipper receives something of value in exchange for the tip or \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 664.</p><p>Petitioner Salman was indicted for federal securities-fraud crimes for trading on inside information he received from a friend and relative-by-marriage, Michael Kara, who, in turn, received the information from his brother, Maher Kara, a former investment banker at Citigroup.  Maher testified at Salman\xe2\x80\x99s trial that he shared inside information with his brother Michael to benefit him and expected him to trade on it, and Michael testified to sharing that information with Salman, who knew that it was from Maher.  Salman was convicted.  </p><p>While Salman\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, the Second Circuit decided that <i>Dirks</i> does not permit a factfinder to infer a personal benefit to the tipper from a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend, unless there is \xe2\x80\x9cproof of a meaningfully close personal relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between tipper and tippee \xe2\x80\x9cthat generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Newman</i>, 773 F.\xc2\xa03d 438, 452, cert. denied, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  The Ninth Circuit declined to follow <i>Newman</i> so far, holding that <i>Dirks</i> allowed Salman\xe2\x80\x99s jury to infer that the tipper breached a duty because he made \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98a gift of confidential information to a trading relative.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d 1087, 1092 (quoting <i>Dirks</i>, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664).  </p><p><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit properly applied <i>Dirks</i> to affirm Salman\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  Under <i>Dirks</i>, the jury could infer that the tipper here personally benefited from making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative<i>.</i>  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p><p>(a)\xc2\xa0Salman contends that a gift of confidential information to a friend or family member alone is insufficient to establish the personal benefit required for tippee liability, claiming that a tipper does not personally benefit unless the tipper\xe2\x80\x99s goal in disclosing information is to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value.  The Government counters that a gift of confidential information to anyone, not just a \xe2\x80\x9ctrading relative or friend,\xe2\x80\x9d is enough to prove securities fraud because a tipper personally benefits through any disclosure of confidential trading information for a personal (non-corporate) purpose.  The Government argues that any concerns raised by permitting such an inference are significantly alleviated by other statutory elements prosecutors must satisfy.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p><p>(b)\xc2\xa0This Court adheres to the holding in <i>Dirks</i>, which easily resolves the case at hand: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [t]he tip and trade resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,\xe2\x80\x9d 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664.  In these situations, the tipper personally benefits because giving a gift of trading information to a trading relative is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds.  Here, by disclosing confidential information as a gift to his brother with the expectation that he would trade on it, Maher breached his duty of trust and confidence to Citigroup and its clients\xe2\x80\x94a duty acquired and breached by Salman when he traded on the information with full knowledge that it had been improperly disclosed.  To the extent that the Second Circuit in <i>Newman </i>held that the tipper must also receive something of a \xe2\x80\x9cpecuniary or similarly valuable nature\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange for a gift to a trading relative, that rule is inconsistent with <i>Dirks.</i>  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p><p>(c)\xc2\xa0Salman\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary are rejected.  Salman has cited nothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents that undermines the gift-giving principle this Court announced in <i>Dirks</i>.  Nor has he demonstrated that either \xc2\xa710(b) itself or <i>Dirks\xe2\x80\x99</i>s gift-giving standard \xe2\x80\x9cleav[e] grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\xe2\x80\x9d or are plagued by \xe2\x80\x9chopeless indeterminacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, ___.

He dealt with highly confidential information about mergers and acquisitions involving Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s clients.  Maher enjoyed a close relationship with his older brother, Mounir Kara (known as Michael).  After Maher started at Citigroup, he began discussing aspects of his job with Michael.  At first he relied on Michael\xe2\x80\x99s chemistry background to help him grasp scientific concepts relevant to his new job.  Then, while their father was battling cancer, the brothers discussed companies that dealt with innovative cancer treatment and pain management techniques.  Michael began to trade on the information Maher shared with him.  At first, Maher was unaware of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s trading activity, but eventually he began to suspect that it was taking place.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, Maher began to assist Michael\xe2\x80\x99s trading by sharing inside information with his brother about pending mergers and acquisitions.  Maher sometimes used code words to communicate corporate information to his brother.  Other times, he shared inside information about dealshe was not working on in order to avoid detection.  See, <i>e.g., </i>App. 118, 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  Without his younger brother\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, Michael fed the information to others\xe2\x80\x94including Salman, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s friend and Maher\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law.  By the time the authorities caught on, Salman had made over $1.5 million in profits that he split with another relative who executed trades via a brokerage account on Salman\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Salman was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, see\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371, and four counts of securities fraud, see 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778j(b), 78ff;\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72; 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935.

Maher \xe2\x80\x9clove[d] [his] brother very much,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael was like \xe2\x80\x9ca second father to Maher,\xe2\x80\x9d and Michael was the best man at Maher\xe2\x80\x99s wedding to Salman\xe2\x80\x99s sister.  <i>Id</i>., at 158, 195, 104\xe2\x80\x93107.  Maher testified that he shared inside information with his brother to benefit him and with the expectation that his brother would trade on it.  While Maher explained that he disclosed the information in large part to appease Michael (who pestered him incessantly for it), he also testified that he tipped his brother to \xe2\x80\x9chelp him\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cfulfil[l] whatever needs he had.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 118, 82.

Maher then disclosed an upcoming acquisition.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Although he instantly regretted the tip and called his brother back to implore him not to trade, Maher expected his brother to do so anyway.  <i>Id.</i>, at 125.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For his part, Michael told the jury that his brother\xe2\x80\x99s tips gave him \xe2\x80\x9ctimely information that the average person does not have access to\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccess to stocks, options, and what have you, that I can capitalize on, that the average person would never have or dream of.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 251.  Michael testified that he became friends with Salman when Maher was courting Salman\xe2\x80\x99s sister and later began sharing Maher\xe2\x80\x99s tips with Salman.  As he explained at trial, \xe2\x80\x9cany time a major deal came in, [Salman] was the first on my phone list.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 258.  Michael also testified that he told Salman that the information was coming from Maher.

He was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and over $730,000 in restitution.  After his motion for a new trial was denied, Salman appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  While his appeal was pending, the Second Circuit issued its opinion in <i>United States </i>v.<i> Newman</i>, 773 F.\xc2\xa03d 438 (2014), cert. denied, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  There, the Second Circuit reversed the convictions of two portfolio managers who traded on inside information.  The <i>Newman</i> defendants were \xe2\x80\x9cseveral steps removed from the corporate insiders\xe2\x80\x9d and the court found that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no evidence that either was aware of the source of the inside information.\xe2\x80\x9d  773 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 443.  The court acknowledged that <i>Dirks</i> and Second Circuit case law allow a factfinder to infer a personal benefit to the tipper from a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.  773 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 452.  But the court concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Dirks</i> permits \xe2\x80\x9csuch an inference,\xe2\x80\x9d the inference \xe2\x80\x9cis impermissible in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  773 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 452.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Pointing to <i>Newman</i>, Salman argued that his conviction should be reversed.  While the evidence established that Maher made a gift of trading information to Michael and that Salman knew it, there was no evidence that Maher received anything of \xe2\x80\x9ca pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange\xe2\x80\x94or that Salman knew of any such benefit.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed and affirmed Salman\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  792 F.\xc2\xa03d 1087.  The court reasoned that the case was governed by <i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a tipper benefits personally by making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.  Indeed, Maher\xe2\x80\x99s disclosures to Michael were \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely the gift of confidential information to a trading relative that <i>Dirks</i> envisioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1092 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To the extent <i>Newman</i> went further and required additional gain to the tipper in cases involving gifts of confidential information to family and friends, the Ninth Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[d] to follow it.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1093.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve the tension between the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Newman</i> decision and the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In this case, Salman contends that an insider\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Dirks</i>, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664, is not enough to establish securities fraud.  Instead, Salman argues, a tipper does not personally benefit unless the tipper\xe2\x80\x99s goal in disclosing inside information is to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value.  He claims that our insider-trading precedents, and the cases those precedents cite, involve situations in which the insider exploited confidential information for the insider\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9ctangible monetary profit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 31.  He suggests that his position is reinforced by our criminal-fraud precedents outside of the insider-trading context, because those cases confirm that a fraudster must personally obtain money or property.  <i>Id</i>., at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  More broadly, Salman urges that defining a gift as a personal benefit renders the insider-trading offense indeterminate and overbroad: indeterminate, because liability may turn on facts such as the closeness of the relationship between tipper and tippee and the tipper\xe2\x80\x99s purpose for disclosure; and overbroad, because the Government may avoid having to prove a concrete per-sonal benefit by simply arguing that the tipper meant to give a gift to the tippee.  He also argues that we should interpret <i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s standard narrowly so as to avoid constitutional concerns.  Brief for Petitioner 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Finally, Salman contends that gift situations create especially troubling problems for remote tippees\xe2\x80\x94that is, tippees who receive inside information from another tippee, rather than the tipper\xe2\x80\x94who may have no knowledge of the relationship between the original tipper and tippee and thus may not know why the tipper made the disclosure.  <i>Id</i>., at 43, 48, 50.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government disagrees and argues that a gift of confidential information to anyone, not just a \xe2\x80\x9ctrading relative or friend,\xe2\x80\x9d is enough to prove securities fraud.  See Brief for United States 27 (\xe2\x80\x9c<i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s personal-benefit test encompasses a gift to<i> any</i> person with the expectation that the information will be used for trading, not just to \xe2\x80\x98a trading relative or friend\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664; emphasis in original)).  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, a tipper personally benefits whenever the tipper discloses confidential trading information for a noncorporate purpose.  Accordingly, a gift to a friend, a family member, or anyone else would support the inference that the tipper exploited the trading value of inside information for personal purposes and thus personally benefited from the disclosure.  The Government claims to find support for this reading in <i>Dirks</i> and the precedents on which <i>Dirks</i> relied.  See, <i>e.g., id.</i>, at 654 (\xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d in an insider-trading case \xe2\x80\x9cderives \xe2\x80\x98from the inherent unfairness involved where one takes advantage\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\x98information intended to be available only for a corporate purpose and not for the personal benefit of anyone\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>In\xc2\xa0re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.</i>, 43 S.\xc2\xa0E. C. 933, 936 (1968))).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government also argues that Salman\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about unlimited and indeterminate liability for remote tippees are significantly alleviated by other statutory elements that prosecutors must satisfy to convict a tippee for insider trading.  The Government observes that, in order to establish a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal liability as a tippee, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the tipper expected that the information being disclosed would be used in securities trading.  Brief for United States 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.  The Government also notes that, to establish a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal liability as a tippee, it must prove that the tippee knew that the tipper breached a duty<i>\xe2\x80\x94</i>in other words, that the tippee knew that the tipper disclosed the information for a personal benefit and that the tipper expected trading to ensue.

Whether the tipper breached that duty depends \xe2\x80\x9cin large part on the purpose of the disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d to the tippee.  463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 662.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he test,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis whether the insider personally will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, the disclosure of confidential information without personal benefit is not enough.  In determining whether a tipper derived a personal benefit, we instructed courts to \xe2\x80\x9cfocus on objective criteria, <i>i.e., </i>whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 663.  This personal benefit can \xe2\x80\x9coften\xe2\x80\x9d be inferred \xe2\x80\x9cfrom objective facts and circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, such as \xe2\x80\x9ca relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the latter, or an intention to benefit the particular recipient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 664.  In particular, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist <i>when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  In such cases, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he tip and trade resemble trading by the insider followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>We then applied this gift-giving principle to resolve <i>Dirks</i> itself, finding it dispositive that the tippers \xe2\x80\x9creceived no monetary or personal benefit\xe2\x80\x9d from their tips to Dirks, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable information to Dirks</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 667 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Our discussion of gift giving resolves this case.  Maher, the tipper, provided inside information to a close relative, his brother Michael.  <i>Dirks </i>makes clear that a tipper breaches a fiduciary duty by making a gift of confidential information to \xe2\x80\x9ca trading relative,\xe2\x80\x9d and that rule is sufficient to resolve the case at hand.  As Salman\xe2\x80\x99s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Maher would have breached his duty had he personally traded on the information here himself then given the proceeds as a gift to his brother.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\xe2\x80\x934.  It is obvious that Maher would personally benefit in that situation.  But Maher effectively achieved the same result by disclosing the information to Michael, and allowing him to trade on it.  <i>Dirks </i>appropriately prohibits that approach, as well. Cf. 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 659 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cinsiders [are] forbidden\xe2\x80\x9d both \xe2\x80\x9cfrom personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage\xe2\x80\x9d and from \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing] such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Dirks</i> specifies that when a tipper gives inside information to \xe2\x80\x9ca trading relative or friend,\xe2\x80\x9d the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent of a cash gift.  In such situations, the tipper benefits personally because giving a gift of trading information is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds.  Here, by disclosing confidential information as a gift to his brother with the expectation that he would trade on it, Maher breached his duty of trust and confidence to Citigroup and its clients\xe2\x80\x94a duty Salman acquired, and breached himself, by trading on the information with full knowledge that it had been improperly disclosed.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also receive something of a \xe2\x80\x9cpecuniary or similarly valuable nature\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange for a gift to family or friends, <i>Newman</i>, 773 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 452, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that this requirement is inconsistent with <i>Dirks</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Salman points out that many insider-trading cases\xe2\x80\x94including several that <i>Dirks</i> cited\xe2\x80\x94involved insiders who personally profited through the misuse of trading information.  But this observation does not undermine the test <i>Dirks </i>articulated and applied.  Salman also cites a sampling of our criminal-fraud decisions construing other federal fraud statutes, suggesting that they stand for the proposition that fraud is not consummated unless the defendant obtains money or property.  <i>Sekhar </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013) (Hobbs Act); <i>Skilling </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358 (2010)\n (honest-services mail and wire fraud); <i>Cleveland </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12 (2000)\n (wire fraud); <i>McNally </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350 (1987)\n (mail fraud).  Assuming that these cases are relevant to our construction of \xc2\xa710(b) (a proposition the Government forcefully disputes), nothing in them undermines the commonsense point we made in <i>Dirks.  </i>Making a gift of inside information to a relative like Michael is little different from trading on the information, obtaining the profits, and doling them out to the trading relative.  The tipper benefits either way.  The facts of this case illustrate the point: In one of their tipper-tippee interactions, Michael asked Maher for a favor, declined Maher\xe2\x80\x99s offer of money, and instead requested and received lucrative trading information.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reject Salman\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s gift-giving standard is unconstitutionally vague as applied to this case.  <i>Dirks</i> created a simple and clear \xe2\x80\x9cguiding principle\xe2\x80\x9d for determining tippee liability, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664, and Salman has not demonstrated that either \xc2\xa710(b) itself or the <i>Dirks</i> gift-giving standard \xe2\x80\x9cleav[e] grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\xe2\x80\x9d or are plagued by \xe2\x80\x9chopeless indeterminacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 5, 7).  At most, Salman shows that in some factual circumstances assessing liability for gift-giving will be difficult.  That alone cannot render \xe2\x80\x9cshapeless\xe2\x80\x9d a federal criminal prohibition, for even clear rules \xe2\x80\x9cproduce close cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 10).  We also reject Salman\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the rule of lenity, as he has shown \xe2\x80\x9cno grievous ambiguity or uncertainty that would trigger the rule\xe2\x80\x99s application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barber </i>v.<i> Thomas</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474,\n492 (2010)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  To the contrary, Salman\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is in the heartland of <i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rule concerning gifts.  It remains the case that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]etermining whether an insider personally benefits from a particular disclosure, a question of fact, will not always be easy for courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664.  But there is no need for us to address those difficult cases today, because this case involves \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely the \xe2\x80\x98gift of confidential information to a trading relative\xe2\x80\x99 that <i>Dirks</i> envisioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  792 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1092 (quoting 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Salman\xe2\x80\x99s jury was properly instructed that a personal benefit includes \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit one would obtain from simply making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 398\xe2\x80\x93399.

In such a case, the defendant breaches a duty to, and takes advantage of, the shareholders of his corporation.  By contrast, the misappropriation theory holds that a person commits securities fraud \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information\xe2\x80\x9d such as an employer or client.  <i>Id.,</i> at 652.  In such a case, the defendant breaches a duty to, and defrauds, the source of the information, as opposed to the shareholders of his corporation.  The Court of Appeals observed that this is a misappropriation case, 792 F.\xc2\xa03d, 1087, 1092, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA9 2015), while the Government represents that both theories apply on the facts of this case, Brief for United States 15, n.\xc2\xa01.  We need not resolve the question.  The parties do not dispute that <i>Dirks</i>\xe2\x80\x99s personal-benefit analysis applies in both classical and misappropriation cases, so we will proceed on the assumption that it does.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</i></div><i>\n</i></div><i>\n</i>\n</div>'
