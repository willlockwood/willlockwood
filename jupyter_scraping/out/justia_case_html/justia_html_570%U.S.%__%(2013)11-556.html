In cases in which the harasser is a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor,\xe2\x80\x9d however, different rules apply.  If the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, \n\n524 U. S. 742\n), the employer is strictly liable.  But if no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may escape liability by establishing, as an affirmative defense, that (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the employer provided.

The District Court granted summary judgment to BSU.

In any event, Congress did not use the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII, and the way to understand the term\xe2\x80\x99s meaning for present purposes is to consider the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured framework adopted in Faragher and Ellerth.

In Ellerth, there was no question that the alleged harasser, who hired and promoted his victim, was a supervisor.  And in Faragher, the parties never disputed the characterization of the alleged harassers as supervisors, so the question simply was not before the Court.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The answer to the question presented in this case is implicit in the characteristics of the framework that the Court adopted in Ellerth and Faragher, which draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors and implies that the authority to take tangible employment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor.  Ellerth, supra, at 762.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe interpretation of the concept of a supervisor adopted today is one that can be readily applied.  An alleged harasser\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor status will often be capable of being discerned before (or soon after) litigation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law before trial.  By contrast, the vagueness of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s standard would impede the resolution of the issue before trial, possibly requiring the jury to be instructed on two very different paths of analysis, depending on whether it finds the alleged harasser to be a supervisor or merely a co-worker.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily tasks.  In such cases, a victim can prevail simply by showing that the employer was negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor in determining negligence.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9325.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0The definition adopted today accounts for the fact that many modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with respect to work assignments.  Petitioner fears that employers will attempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment actions, but a broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessary to guard against that concern.

See id., at *12 (quoting Hall v. Bodine Elect. Co., 276 F.\xc2\xa03d 345, 355 (CA7 2002)).

It explained that, under its settled precedent, supervisor status requires \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline an employee.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 470 (quoting Hall, supra, at 355).

Finding that BSU was not negligent with respect to Davis\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, the court affirmed.  646 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 470\xe2\x80\x93473.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice for an employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  This provision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to employment decisions that have direct economic consequences, such as termination, demotion, and pay cuts.  But not long after Title VII was enacted, the lower courts held that Title VII also reaches the creation or perpetuation of a discriminatory work environment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the leading case of Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.\xc2\xa02d 234 (1971), the Fifth Circuit recognized a cause of action based on this theory.  See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57\n\xe2\x80\x9366 (1986) (describing development of hostile environment claims based on race).  The Rogers court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\xe2\x80\x99 in [Title VII] is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 238.  The court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psy- chological stability of minority group workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Following this decision, the lower courts generally held that an employer was liable for a racially hostile work environ- ment if the employer was negligent, i.e., if the employer knew or reasonably should have known about the harassment but failed to take remedial action.

See Meritor, supra, at 64\xe2\x80\x9367.  In such cases, we have held, the plaintiff must show that the work environment was so pervaded by discrimination that the terms and conditions of employment were altered.  See, e.g., Harris v.

Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 789.  Courts have generally applied this rule to evaluate employer liability when a co-worker harasses the plaintiff.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Ellerth and Faragher, however, we held that different rules apply where the harassing employee is the plain- tiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  In those instances, an employer may be vicariously liable for its employees\xe2\x80\x99 creation of a hostile work environment.

And because racial and sexual harassment are unlikely to fall within the scope of a servant\xe2\x80\x99s duties, application of this rule would generally preclude employer liability for employee harassment.  See Faragher, supra, at 793\xe2\x80\x93796; Ellerth, supra, at 757.  But in Ellerth and Faragher, we held that a provision of the Restatement provided the basis for an exception.  Section 219(2)(d) of that Restatement recognizes an exception to the general rule just noted for situations in which the servant was \xe2\x80\x9caided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Restatement 481; see Far- agher,  supra, at 802\xe2\x80\x93803; Ellerth, supra, at 760\xe2\x80\x93763.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdapting this concept to the Title VII context, Ellerth and Faragher identified two situations in which the aided-in-the-accomplishment rule warrants employer liability even in the absence of negligence, and both of these situations involve harassment by a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to a co-worker.  First, the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a supervisor takes a tangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d Ellerth, supra, at 762; Faragher, supra, at 790\xe2\x80\x94i.e., \xe2\x80\x9ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761.  We explained the reason for this rule as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. A tangible employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a company act.  The decision in most cases is documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by higher level supervisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 761\xe2\x80\x93762.  In those circumstances, we said, it is appropriate to hold the employer strictly liable.  See Faragher, supra, at 807; Ellerth, supra, at 765.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Ellerth and Faragher held that, even when a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the employer can be vicariously liable for the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s creation of a hostile work environment if the employer is unable to establish an affirmative defense.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We began by noting that \xe2\x80\x9ca supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a  supervisor always is aided by the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d  El- lerth, supra, at 763; see Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 803\xe2\x80\x93805.  But it would go too far, we found, to make employers strictly liable whenever a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d engages in harassment that does not result in a tangible employment action, and we therefore held that in such cases the employer may raise an affirmative defense.  Specifically, an employer can mitigate or avoid liability by showing (1) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities that were provided.  Faragher, supra, at 807; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 765.  This compromise, we ex- plained, \xe2\x80\x9caccommodate[s] the agency principles of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 764.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissenting Members of the Court in Ellerth and Faragher would not have created a special rule for cases involving harassment by \xe2\x80\x9csupervisors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, they would have held that an employer is liable for any employee\xe2\x80\x99s creation of a hostile work environment \xe2\x80\x9cif, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the [offending] conduct to occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellerth, supra, at 767 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Faragher, supra, at 810 (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder Ellerth and Faragher, it is obviously important whether an alleged harasser is a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d or merely a co-worker, and the lower courts have disagreed about the meaning of the concept of a supervisor in this context.  Some courts, including the Seventh Circuit below, have held that an employee is not a supervisor unless he or she has the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline the victim.  E.g., 646 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 470; Noviello v. Boston, 398 F.\xc2\xa03d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp., 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 1049, 1057 (CA8 2004).  Other courts have substantially followed the more open-ended approach advocated by the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s Enforcement Guidance, which ties supervisor status to the ability to exercise significant direction over another\xe2\x80\x99s daily work.  See, e.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 126\xe2\x80\x93127 (CA2 2003); Whitten v.

Those decisions contemplate a unitary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the authority to make tangible employment decisions.  There is no hint in either decision that the Court had in mind two categories of supervisors: first, those who have such authority and, second, those who, although lacking this power, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s labor to some ill-defined degree.  On the contrary, the Ellerth/Faragher framework is one under which supervisory status can usually be readily determined, generally by written documentation.  The approach recommended by the EEOC Guidance, by contrast, would make the determination of supervisor status depend on a highly case-specific evaluation of numerous factors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ellerth/Faragher framework represents what the Court saw as a workable compromise between the aided-in-the-accomplishment theory of vicarious liability and the legitimate interests of employers.  The Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor,\xe2\x80\x9d with which we agree, is easily workable; it can be applied without undue difficulty at both the summary judgment stage and at trial.  The alternative, in many cases, would frustrate judges and confound jurors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner contends that her expansive understanding of the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d is supported by the meaning of the word in general usage and in other legal contexts, see Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9328, but this argument is both incorrect on its own terms and, in any event, misguided.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn general usage, the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d lacks a sufficiently specific meaning to be helpful for present purposes.  Petitioner is certainly right that the term is often used to refer to a person who has the authority to direct another\xe2\x80\x99s work.  See, e.g., 17 Oxford English Dictionary 245 (2d ed. 1989) (defining the term as applying to \xe2\x80\x9cone who inspects and directs the work of others\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the term is also often closely tied to the authority to take what Ellerth and Faragher referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2296, def. 1(a) (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9ca person having authority dele- gated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall, promote, assign, or discharge another employee or to rec- ommend such action\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA comparison of the definitions provided by two colloquial business authorities illustrates the term\xe2\x80\x99s imprecision in general usage.  One says that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]upervisors are usually authorized to recommend and/or effect hiring, disciplining, promoting, punishing, rewarding, and other associated activities regarding the employees in their departments.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Another says exactly the opposite: \xe2\x80\x9cA supervisor generally does not have the power to hire or fire employees or to promote them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Compare Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 762 (\xe2\x80\x9cTangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf we look beyond general usage to the meaning of the term in other legal contexts, we find much the same situation.  Sometimes the term is reserved for those in the upper echelons of the management hierarchy.  See, e.g., \n\n25 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72021(18) (defining the \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d of a school within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cthe individual in the position of ultimate authority at a Bureau school\xe2\x80\x9d).  But sometimes the term is used to refer to lower ranking individuals.  See, e.g., \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7152(11) (defining a supervisor to include \xe2\x80\x9cany individual having authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment\xe2\x80\x9d); \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396n(j)(4)(A) (providing that an eligible Medicaid beneficiary who receives care through an approved self-directed services plan may \xe2\x80\x9chire, fire, supervise, and manage the individuals providing such services\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the meaning of the concept of a supervisor varies from one legal context to another, the law often contemplates that the ability to supervise includes the ability to take tangible employment actions.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See, e.g., 5 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79701.511(a)(2), (3) (2012) (referring to a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s authority to \xe2\x80\x9chire, assign, and direct employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and [t]o lay off and retain employees, or to suspend, re- \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tmove, reduce in grade, band, or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees or, with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa79701.212(b)(4) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory work\xe2\x80\x9d as that which \xe2\x80\x9cmay involve hiring or selecting employees, assigning work, managing performance, recognizing and rewarding employees, and other associated duties\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d has varying meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law.

Rather, the term was adopted by this Court in Ellerth and Faragher as a label for the class of employees whose misconduct may give rise to vicarious employer liability.  Accordingly, the way to understand the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d for present purposes is to consider the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured framework that those cases adopted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn considering Ellerth and Faragher, we are met at the outset with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom we treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s definition demands.  This argument misreads our decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Ellerth, it was clear that the alleged harasser was a supervisor under any definition of the term: He hired his victim, and he promoted her (subject only to the minis- terial approval of his supervisor, who merely signed the paperwork).  524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 747.  Ellerth was a case from the Seventh Circuit, and at the time of its decision in that case, that court had already adopted its current definition of a supervisor.  See Volk v. Coler, 845 F.\xc2\xa02d 1422, 1436 (1988).  See also Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc., 163 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027, 1033, n.\xc2\xa01 (CA7 1998) (discussing Circuit case law).  Although the en banc Seventh Circuit in Ellerth issued eight separate opinions, there was no disagreement about the harasser\xe2\x80\x99s status as a supervisor.  Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F.\xc2\xa03d 490 (1997) (per curiam).  Likewise, when the case reached this Court, no question about the harasser\xe2\x80\x99s status was raised.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same is true with respect to Faragher. In that case, Faragher, a female lifeguard, sued her employer, the city of Boca Raton, for sexual harassment based on the conduct of two other lifeguards, Bill Terry and David Silverman, and we held that the city was vicariously liable for Terry\xe2\x80\x99s and Silverman\xe2\x80\x99s harassment.  Although it is clear that Terry had authority to take tangible employment actions affecting the victim,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t see 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 781 (explaining that Terry could hire new lifeguards, supervise their work assignments, counsel, and discipline them), Silverman \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tmay have wielded less authority, ibid.

Post, at 8 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).

The ability to direct another employee\xe2\x80\x99s tasks is simply not sufficient.  Employees with such powers are certainly capable of creating intolerable work environments, see post, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311 (discussing examples), but so are many other co-workers.  Negligence provides the better framework for evaluating an employer\xe2\x80\x99s liability when a harassing employee lacks the power to take tangible employment actions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough our holdings in Faragher and Ellerth do not resolve the question now before us, we believe that the answer to that question is implicit in the characteristics of the framework that we adopted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin, there is no hint in either Ellerth or Faragher that the Court contemplated anything other than a unitary category of supervisors, namely, those possessing the authority to effect a tangible change in a victim\xe2\x80\x99s terms or conditions of employment.  The Ellerth/Faragher framework draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors.  Co-workers, the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9ccan inflict psychologi- cal injuries\xe2\x80\x9d by creating a hostile work environment, but they \xe2\x80\x9ccannot dock another\xe2\x80\x99s pay, nor can one co-worker demote another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 762.  Only a supervisor has the power to cause \xe2\x80\x9cdirect economic harm\xe2\x80\x9d by taking a tangible employment action.  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9cTangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor.  The supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The strong implication of this passage is that the authority to take tangible employment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor, not simply a characteristic of a subset of an ill-defined class of employees who qualify as supervisors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe way in which we framed the question presented in Ellerth supports this understanding.  As noted, the Ellerth/Faragher framework sets out two circumstances in which an employer may be vicariously liable for a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s harassment.  The first situation (which results in strict liability) exists when a supervisor actually takes a tangible employment action based on, for example, a subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to accede to sexual demands.  The second situation (which results in vicarious liability if the employer cannot make out the requisite affirmative defense) is present when no such tangible action is taken.  Both Ellerth and Faragher fell into the second category, and in Ellerth, the Court couched the question at issue in the following terms: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an employer has vicarious liability when a supervisor creates a hostile work en- vironment by making explicit threats to alter a subor- dinate\xe2\x80\x99s terms or conditions of employment, based on sex, but does not fulfill the threat.\xe2\x80\x9d  524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 754.  This statement plainly ties the second situation to a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s authority to inflict direct economic injury.  It is because a supervisor has that authority\xe2\x80\x94and its potential use hangs as a threat over the victim\xe2\x80\x94that vicarious liability (subject to the affirmative defense) is justified.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Ellerth/Faragher Court sought a framework that would be workable and would appropriately take into account the legitimate interests of employers and employees.  The Court looked to principles of agency law for guidance, but the Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cmalleable terminology\xe2\x80\x9d of the aided-in-the-commission principle counseled against the wholesale incorporation of that principle into Title VII case law.  Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 763.  Instead, the Court also considered the objectives of Title VII, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe limitation of employer liability in certain circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 764.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we adopt today is one that can be readily applied.  In a great many cases, it will be known even before litigation is commenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervi- sor, and in others, the alleged harasser\xe2\x80\x99s status will become clear to both sides after discovery.  And once this is known, the parties will be in a position to assess the strength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute.  Where this does not occur, supervisor status will generally be capable of resolution at summary judgment.  By contrast, under the approach advocated by petitioner and the EEOC, supervisor status would very often be murky\xe2\x80\x94as this case well illustrates.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccording to petitioner, the record shows that Davis, her alleged harasser, wielded enough authority to qualify as a supervisor.  Petitioner points in particular to Davis\xe2\x80\x99 job description, which gave her leadership responsibilities, and to evidence that Davis at times led or directed Vance and other employees in the kitchen.  See Brief for Petitioner 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (citing record); Reply Brief 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (same).  The United States, on the other hand, while applying the same open-ended test for supervisory status, reaches the opposite conclusion.  At least on the present record, the United States tells us, Davis fails to qualify as a supervisor.  Her job description, in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, is not dispositive, and the Government adds that it would not be enough for petitioner to show that Davis \xe2\x80\x9coccasionally took the lead in the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (U.\xc2\xa0S.

In its Enforcement Guidance, the EEOC takes the position that an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor, must wield authority \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of sufficient magnitude so as to as- sist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 27 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a (EEOC Guidance)).  But any authority over the work of another employee provides at least some assistance, see Ellerth, supra, at 763, and that is not what the United States interprets the Guidance to mean.  Rather, it informs us, the authority must exceed both an ill-defined temporal requirement (it must be more than \xe2\x80\x9cocca- siona[l]\xe2\x80\x9d) and an ill-defined substantive requirement (\xe2\x80\x9can employee who directs \xe2\x80\x98only a limited number of tasks or assignments\xe2\x80\x99 for another employee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would not have sufficient authority to qualify as a supervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S.

And if this is a correct interpretation of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s position, what we are left with is a proposed standard of remarkable ambiguity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe vagueness of this standard was highlighted at oral argument when the attorney representing the United States was asked to apply that standard to the situation in Faragher, where the alleged harasser supposedly threatened to assign the plaintiff to clean the toilets in the lifeguard station for a year if she did not date him.  524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 780.  Since cleaning the toilets is just one task, albeit an unpleasant one, the authority to assign that job would not seem to meet the more-than-a-limited-number-of-tasks requirement in the EEOC Guidance.  Nevertheless, the Government attorney\xe2\x80\x99s first response was that the authority to make this assignment would be enough.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.  He later qualified that answer by saying that it would be necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cknow how much of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work [was] encompassed by cleaning the toilets.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  He did not explain what percentage of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work (50%, 25%, 10%?) would suffice.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government attorney\xe2\x80\x99s inability to provide a de- finitive answer to this question was the inevitable con- sequence of the vague standard that the Government asks us to adopt.  Key components of that standard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d authority, authority to assign more than a \xe2\x80\x9climited number of tasks,\xe2\x80\x9d and authority that is exercised more than \xe2\x80\x9coccasionally\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94have no clear meaning.

The elimination of this issue from the trial will focus the efforts of the parties, who will be able to present their cases in a way that conforms to the framework that the jury will apply.  The plaintiff will know whether he or she must prove that the employer was negligent or whether the employer will have the burden of proving the elements of the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense.  Perhaps even more important, the work of the jury, which is inevitably complicated in employment discrimination cases, will be simplified.  The jurors can be given preliminary instructions that allow them to understand, as the evidence comes in, how each item of proof fits into the framework that they will ultimately be required to apply.  And even where the issue of supervisor status cannot be eliminated from the trial (because there are genuine factual disputes about an alleged harasser\xe2\x80\x99s authority to take tangible employment actions), this preliminary question is rela- tively straightforward.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe alternative approach advocated by petitioner and the United States would make matters far more complicated and difficult.  The complexity of the standard they favor would impede the resolution of the issue before trial.  With the issue still open when trial commences, the parties would be compelled to present evidence and argu- ment on supervisor status, the affirmative defense, and the question of negligence, and the jury would have to grapple with all those issues as well.  In addition, it would often be necessary for the jury to be instructed about two very different paths of analysis, i.e., what to do if the alleged harasser was found to be a supervisor and what to do if the alleged harasser was found to be merely a co-worker.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCourts and commentators alike have opined on the need for reasonably clear jury instructions in employment discrimination cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And the danger of juror confusion is particularly high where the jury is faced with instructions on alternative theories of liability under which different parties bear the burden of proof.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F14" name="T14">\n\t\t\t\t\t14\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  By simplifying the process of determining who is a supervisor (and by extension, which liability rules apply to a given set of facts), the approach that we take will help to ensure that juries return verdicts that reflect the application of the correct legal rules to the facts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestions, see post, at 14, 17, this approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess the authority to inflict psychological injury by assigning unpleasant tasks or by altering the work environment in objectionable ways.  In such cases, the victims will be able to prevail simply by showing that the employer was negligent in permitting this harassment to occur, and the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be con- sidered in determining whether the employer was negligent.  The nature and degree of authority possessed by harassing employees varies greatly, see post, 9\xe2\x80\x9311 (offering examples), and as we explained above, the test proposed by petitioner and the United States is ill equipped to deal with the variety of situations that will inevitably arise.  This variety presents no problem for the negligence standard, which is thought to provide adequate protection for tort plaintiffs in many other situations.  There is no reason why this standard, if accompanied by proper instructions, cannot provide the same service in the context at issue here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent argues that the definition of a supervisor that we now adopt is out of touch with the realities of the workplace, where individuals with the power to assign daily tasks are often regarded by other employees as supervisors.  See post, at 5, 8\xe2\x80\x9312.  But in reality it is the alternative that is out of touch.  Particularly in modern organizations that have abandoned a highly hierarchical management structure, it is common for employees to have overlapping authority with respect to the assignment of work tasks.  Members of a team may each have the responsibility for taking the lead with respect to a particular aspect of the work and thus may have the responsibility to direct each other in that area of responsibility.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, petitioner argues that tying supervisor status to the authority to take tangible employment actions will encourage employers to attempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment actions.  But a broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessary to guard against this concern.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs an initial matter, an employer will always be liable when its negligence leads to the creation or continuation of a hostile work environment.  And even if an employer concentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few individuals, it likely will not isolate itself from heightened liability under Faragher and Ellerth.  If an employer does attempt to confine decisionmaking power to a small number of individuals, those individuals will have a limited ability to exercise independent discretion when making decisions and will likely rely on other workers who actu- ally interact with the affected employee.  Cf. Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 498, 509 (CA7 2004) (Rovner, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough they did not have the power to take formal employment actions vis-\xc3\xa0-vis [the victim], [the harassers] necessarily must have had substantial input into those decisions, as they would have been the people most familiar with her work\xe2\x80\x94certainly more familiar with it than the off-site Department Administrative Services Manager\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under those circumstances, the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions to the employees on whose recommendations it relies.

However, the dissent does not mention why the plaintiffs would lose in those cases.  It is not clear in any of those examples that the legal outcome hinges on the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, Clara Whitten ultimately did not prevail on her discrimination claims\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding the fact that the Fourth Circuit adopted the approach advocated by the dissent, see Whitten v.

Illinois Dept. of Transp., 243 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 810, 817 (ND Ill. 2003), and no court had occasion to determine whether the employer could have established the affirmative defense (a prospect that is certainly feasible given that there was evidence that the employer had an \xe2\x80\x9cadequate anti-harassment policy in place,\xe2\x80\x9d that the employer promptly addressed the incidents about which Rhodes complained, and that \xe2\x80\x9cRhodes failed to take advantage of the preventative or corrective opportunities provided,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhodes v.

Evidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed would be relevant.

See post, at 20 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is cause to anticipate that Davis would not qualify as Vance\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor\xe2\x80\x9d).  On that point, we agree.

Petitioner argues that the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition supports her position in this case to the extent that it encompasses employees who have the ability to direct or assign work to subordinates.  Brief for Petitioner 27\xe2\x80\x9328.\nThe NLRA certainly appears to define \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d in broad terms.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the lower courts, however, have consistently explained that supervisory authority is not trivial or insignificant: If the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d is construed too broadly, then employees who are deemed to be supervisors will be denied rights that the NLRA was intended to protect.  E.g., In re Connecticut Humane Society, 358 NLRB No. 31, *33 (Apr. 12, 2012); Frenchtown Acquisition Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 683 F. 3d 298, 305 (CA6 2012); Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F. 3d 960, 963 (CADC 1999).  Indeed, in defining a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA, Congress sought to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cbetween straw bosses, leadmen, set-up men, and other minor supervisory employees, on the one hand, and the supervisor vested with such genuine management prerogatives as theright to hire or fire, discipline, or make effective recommendations with respect to such action.\xe2\x80\x9d S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1947).  Cf. NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. of America, \n (HCRA) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThrough case-by-case adjudication, the Board has sought to distinguish individuals exercising the level of control that truly places them in the ranks of management, from highly skilled employees, whether professional or technical, who perform, incidentally to their skilled work, a limited supervisory role\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the NLRB has interpreted the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory definition of supervisor more narrowly than its plain language might permit.  See, e.g., Connecticut Humane Society, supra, at *39 (an employee who evaluates others is not a supervisor unless the evaluation \xe2\x80\x9caffect[s] the wages and the job status of the employee evaluated\xe2\x80\x9d); In re CGLM, Inc., 350 NLRB 974, 977 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If any authority over someone else, no matter how insignificant or infrequent, made an employee a super-visor, our industrial composite would be predominantly supervisory.  Every order-giver is not a supervisor.  Even the traffic director tells the president of the company where to park his car\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting NLRB v. Security Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F.\xc2\xa02d 143, 151 (CA5 1967))).  The NLRA therefore does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d as broadly as petitioner suggests.\nTo be sure, the NLRA may in some instances define \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly than we define the term in this case.  But those differences reflect the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s unique purpose, which is to preserve the balance of power between labor and management, see HCRA, supra, at 573 (explaining that Congress amended the NLRA to exclude supervisors in order to address the \xe2\x80\x9cimbalance between labor and management\xe2\x80\x9d that resulted when \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory employees could organize as part of bargaining units and negotiate with the employer\xe2\x80\x9d).  That purpose is inapposite in the context of Title VII, which focuses on eradicating discrimination.  An employee may have a sufficient degree of authority over subordinates such that Congress has decided that the employee should not participate with lower level employees in the same collective-bargaining unit (because, for example, a higher level employee will pursue his own interests at the expense of lower level employees\xe2\x80\x99 interests), but that authority is not necessarily sufficient to merit heightened liability for the purposes of Title VII.  The NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of supervisor therefore is not controlling in this context.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The dissent suggests that it is unclear whether Terry would qualify as a supervisor under the test we adopt because his hiring decisions were subject to approval by higher management.  Post, at 7, n.\xc2\xa01 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  See also Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 781.  But we have assumed that tangible employment actions can be subject to such approval.  See Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 762.  In any event, the record indicates that Terry possessed the power to make employment decisions having direct economic consequences for his victims.  See Brief for Petitioner in Faragher v. Boca Raton, O. T. 1997, No. 97\xe2\x80\x93282, p.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo one, during the twenty years that Terry was Marine Safety Chief, was hired without his recommendation.

If that discipline had economic consequences (such as suspension without pay), then Silverman might qualify as a supervisor under the definition we adopt today.\nSilverman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assign Faragher significantly different work responsibilities also may have constituted a tangible employment action.  Silverman told Faragher, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Date me or clean the toilets for a year.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Faragher, supra, at 780.  That threatened reassignment of duties likely would have constituted significantly different responsibilities for a lifeguard, whose job typically is to guard the beach.  If that reassignment had economic consequences, such as foreclosing Far-agher\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for promotion, then it might constitute a tangible employment action.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">10</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The lower court did not even address this issue.

Addressing who qualifies as a supervisor, the EEOC answered: (1) an individual authorized \xe2\x80\x9cto undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9chiring, firing, promoting, demoting, and reassigning the employee\xe2\x80\x9d; or (2) an individual authorized \xe2\x80\x9cto direct the employee\xe2\x80\x99s daily work activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 405:7654.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court today strikes from the supervisory category employees who control the day-to-day schedules and assignments of others, confining the category to those formally empowered to take tangible employment actions.  The limitation the Court decrees diminishes the force of Faragher and Ellerth, ignores the conditions under which members of the work force labor, and disserves the objective of Title VII to prevent discrimination from infecting the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s workplaces.  I would follow the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s Guidance and hold that the authority to direct an employee\xe2\x80\x99s daily activities establishes supervisory status under Title VII.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTitle VII makes it \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice for an employer\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).

Recognizing that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d includes an employer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cagent[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(b), the Court looked to agency law for guidance in formulating liability standards.  Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 791, 801; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 755\xe2\x80\x93760.  In particular, the Court drew upon \xc2\xa7219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957), which makes an employer liable for the conduct of an employee, even when that employee acts beyond the scope of her employment, if the employee is \xe2\x80\x9caided in accomplishing\xe2\x80\x9d a tort \xe2\x80\x9cby the existence of the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 801; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 758.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStemming from that guide, Faragher and Ellerth distinguished between harassment perpetrated by supervisors, which is often enabled by the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s agency relationship with the employer, and harassment perpetrated by co-workers, which is not similarly facilitated.  Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93803; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 763\xe2\x80\x93765.  If the harassing employee is a supervisor, the Court held, the employer is vicariously liable whenever the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action.  Far- agher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 807\xe2\x80\x93808; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 764\xe2\x80\x93765.  The term \xe2\x80\x9ctangible employment action,\xe2\x80\x9d Ellerth observed, \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 761.  Such an action, the Court explained, provides \xe2\x80\x9cassurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 761\xe2\x80\x93762.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn employer may also be held vicariously liable for a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s harassment that does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the Court next determined.  In such a case, however, the employer may avoid liability by showing that (1) it exercised reasonable care to pre-vent and promptly correct harassing behavior, and (2) the complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective measures made available to her.  Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 765.  The employer bears the burden of establishing this affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 765.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn contrast, if the harassing employee is a co-worker, a negligence standard applies.  To satisfy that standard, the complainant must show that the employer knew or should have known of the offensive conduct but failed to take appropriate corrective action.  See Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 799; Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 758\xe2\x80\x93759.

Exposed to a fellow employee\xe2\x80\x99s harassment, one can walk away or tell the offender to \xe2\x80\x9cbuzz off.\xe2\x80\x9d  A supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s slings and arrows, however, are not so easily avoided.  An employee who confronts her harassing supervisor risks, for example, receiving an undesirable or unsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer.  She may be saddled with an excessive workload or with placement on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family life.  And she may be demoted or fired.  Facing such dangers, she may be reluctant to blow the whistle on her superior, whose \xe2\x80\x9cpower and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 763.  See also Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 803; Brief for Respondent 23 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe potential threat to one\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood or working conditions will make the victim think twice before resisting harassment or fighting back.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, as Faragher and Ellerth recognized, harassment by supervisors is more likely to cause palpable harm and to persist unabated than similar conduct by fellow employees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Faragher and Ellerth differentiated harassment by supervisors from harassment by co-workers, neither decision gave a definitive answer to the question: Who qualifies as a supervisor?  Two views have emerged.  One view, in line with the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s Guidance, counts as a supervisor anyone with authority to take tangible employ-ment actions or to direct an employee\xe2\x80\x99s daily work activities.  E.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 127 (CA2 2003); Whitten v. Fred\xe2\x80\x99s, Inc., 601 F.\xc2\xa03d 231, 246 (CA4 2010); EEOC Guidance 405:7654.  The other view ranks as supervisors only those authorized to take tangible employment actions.  E.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398 F.\xc2\xa03d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc., 163 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027, 1034 (CA7 1998); Joens v.

See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  It is blind to the realities of the workplace, and it discounts the guidance of the EEOC, the agency Congress established to interpret, and superintend the enforcement of, Title VII.  Under that guidance, the appropriate question is: Has the employer given the alleged harasser authority to take tangible employment actions or to control the conditions under which subordinates do their daily work?  If the answer to either inquiry is yes, vicarious liability is in order, for the superior-subordinate working arrangement facilitating the harassment is of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s making.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUntil today, our decisions have assumed that employees who direct subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 daily work are supervisors.  In Faragher, the city of Boca Raton, Florida, employed Bill Terry and David Silverman to oversee the city\xe2\x80\x99s corps of ocean lifeguards.  524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 780.  Terry and Silverman \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly subject[ed] Faragher and other female lifeguards to uninvited and offensive touching,\xe2\x80\x9d and they regularly \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] lewd remarks, and [spoke] of women in offensive terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Terry told a job applicant that \xe2\x80\x9cfemale lifeguards had sex with their male counterparts,\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9casked whether she would do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 782.  Silverman threatened to assign Faragher to toilet-cleaning duties for a year if she refused to date him.  Id., at 780.  In words and conduct, Silverman and Terry made the beach a hostile place for women to work.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs Chief of Boca Raton\xe2\x80\x99s Marine Safety Division, Terry had authority to \xe2\x80\x9chire new lifeguards (subject to the approval of higher management), to supervise all aspects of the lifeguards\xe2\x80\x99 work assignments, to engage in counseling, to deliver oral reprimands, and to make a record of any such discipline.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 781.  Silverman\xe2\x80\x99s duties as a Marine Safety lieutenant included \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the lifeguards\xe2\x80\x99 daily assignments, and . . . supervising their work and fitness training.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Both men \xe2\x80\x9cwere granted virtually unchecked authority over their subordinates, directly controlling and supervising all aspects of Faragher\xe2\x80\x99s day-to-day activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 808 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe may assume that Terry would fall within the definition of supervisor the Court adopts today.  See ante, at 9.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But nothing in the Faragher record shows that Silver- man would.  Silverman had oversight and assignment responsibilities\xe2\x80\x94he could punish lifeguards who would not date him with full-time toilet-cleaning duty\xe2\x80\x94but there was no evidence that he had authority to take tangible employment actions.  See Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 780\xe2\x80\x93781.  Holding that Boca Raton was vicariously liable for Silverman\xe2\x80\x99s harassment, id., at 808\xe2\x80\x93809, the Court characterized him as Faragher\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor, see id., at 780, and there was no dissent on that point, see id., at 810 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSubsequent decisions reinforced Faragher\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass employees with authority to direct the daily work of their victims.  In Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, \n140 (2004)\n, for example, the Court considered whether a constructive discharge occasioned by supervisor harassment ranks as a tangible employment action.  The harassing employees lacked authority to discharge or demote the complainant, but they were \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for the day-to-day supervi- sion\xe2\x80\x9d of the workplace and for overseeing employee shifts.  Suders v. Easton, 325 F.\xc2\xa03d 432, 450, n.\xc2\xa011 (CA3 2003).  Describing the harassing employees as the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csupervisors,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court proceeded to evaluate the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s constructive discharge claim under the Ellerth and Faragher framework.  Suders, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 134, 140\xe2\x80\x93141.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true, as the Court says, ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317, and n.\xc2\xa011, that Faragher and later cases did not squarely resolve whether an employee without power to take tangible em-ployment actions may nonetheless qualify as a supervisor.  But in laboring to establish that Silverman\xe2\x80\x99s supervi- sor status, undisputed in Faragher, is not dispositive here, the Court misses the forest for the trees.  Faragher illustrates an all-too-plain reality: A supervisor with authority to control subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 daily work is no less aided in his harassment than is a supervisor with authority to fire, demote, or transfer.  That Silverman could threaten Far-agher with toilet-cleaning duties while Terry could orally reprimand her was inconsequential in Faragher, and properly so.  What mattered was that both men took advantage of the power vested in them as agents of Boca Raton to facilitate their abuse.  See Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 801 (Silverman and Terry \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly threaten[ed] to mis-use their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d).  And when, assisted by an agency relationship, in-charge superiors like Silverman perpetuate a discriminatory work environment, our decisions have appropriately held the employer vicariously liable, subject to the above-described affirmative defense.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWorkplace realities fortify my conclusion that harassment by an employee with power to direct subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 day-to-day work activities should trigger vicarious employer liability.  The following illustrations, none of them hypothetical, involve in-charge employees of the kind the Court today excludes from supervisory status.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYasharay Mack: Yasharay Mack, an African-American woman, worked for the Otis Elevator Company as an elevator mechanic\xe2\x80\x99s helper at the Metropolitan Life Building in New York City.

In her third season working at the yard, Rhodes was verbally assaulted with sex-based invectives and a pornographic image was taped to her locker.  Poladian forced her to wash her truck in sub-zero temperatures, assigned her undesirable yard work instead of road crew work, and prohibited another employee from fixing the malfunctioning heating system in her truck.  Conceding that Rhodes had been subjected to a sex-based hostile work environment, the Department of Transportation argued successfully in the District Court and Court of Appeals that Poladian and Mara were not Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors because they lacked authority to take tangible employment actions against her.

Trainees like Starke were paired in a truck cabin with a single \xe2\x80\x9clead driver\xe2\x80\x9d who lacked authority to hire, fire, promote, or demote, but who exercised control over the work environment for the duration of the trip.  Lead drivers were responsible for providing instruction on CRST\xe2\x80\x99s driving method, assigning specific tasks, and scheduling rest stops.  At the end of the trip, lead drivers evaluated trainees\xe2\x80\x99 performance with a nonbinding pass or fail recommendation that could lead to full driver status.  Over the course of Starke\xe2\x80\x99s training trip, her first lead driver, Bob Smith, filled the cabin with vulgar sexual remarks, commenting on her breast size and comparing the gear stick to genitalia.  A second lead driver, David Goodman, later forced her into unwanted sex with him, an outrage to which she submitted, believing it necessary to gain a passing grade.  See EEOC v. CRST Van Expedited, Inc., 679 F.\xc2\xa03d 657, 665\xe2\x80\x93666, 684\xe2\x80\x93685 (CA8 2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn each of these cases, a person vested with authority to control the conditions of a subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s daily work life used his position to aid his harassment.  But in none of them would the Court\xe2\x80\x99s severely confined definition of su-pervisor yield vicarious liability for the employer.  The senior elevator mechanic in charge, the Court today tells us, was Mack\xe2\x80\x99s co-worker, not her supervisor.  So was the store manager who punished Whitten with long hours for refusing to give him what he wanted.

An employer is vicariously liable only when the authority it has delegated enables actionable harassment, the EEOC recognized.  EEOC Guidance 405:7654.  For that reason, a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s authority must be \xe2\x80\x9cof a sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser . . . in carrying out the harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Determining whether an employee wields sufficient authority is not a mechanical inquiry, the EEOC explained; instead, specific facts about the employee\xe2\x80\x99s job function are critical.  Id., at 405:7653 to 405:7654.  Thus, an employee with authority to increase another\xe2\x80\x99s workload or assign undesirable tasks may rank as a supervisor, for those powers can enable harassment.  Id., at 405:7654.  On the other hand, an employee \xe2\x80\x9cwho directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily would not qualify as a supervisor, for her harassing conduct is not likely to be aided materially by the agency relationship.  Id., at 405:7655.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s definition, which the Court puts down as \xe2\x80\x9ca study in ambiguity,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 21, has the ring of truth and, therefore, powerfully persuasive force.  As a precondition to vicarious employer liability, the EEOC explained, the harassing supervisor must wield authority of sufficient magnitude to enable the harassment.  In other words, the aided-in-accomplishment standard requires \xe2\x80\x9csomething more than the employment relation itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 760.  Furthermore, as the EEOC perceived, in assessing an employee\xe2\x80\x99s qualification as a supervisor, context is often key.  See infra, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  I would accord the agency\xe2\x80\x99s judgment due respect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExhibiting remarkable resistance to the thrust of our prior decisions, workplace realities, and the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s Guidance, the Court embraces a position that relieves scores of employers of responsibility for the behavior of the supervisors they employ.  Trumpeting the virtues of simplicity and administrability, the Court restricts supervisor status to those with power to take tangible employment actions.  In so restricting the definition of supervisor, the Court once again shuts from sight the \xe2\x80\x9crobust protection against workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII to secure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ledbetter v.

A supervisor, the Court holds, is someone empowered to \xe2\x80\x9ctake tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a \xe2\x80\x98significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsi-bilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9 (quoting Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 761).  Whether reassignment authority makes someone a supervisor might depend on whether the reassignment carries economic consequences.  Ante, at 16, n.\xc2\xa09.  The power to discipline other employees, when the discipline has economic consequences, might count, too.  Ibid.  So might the power to initiate or make recommendations about tangible employment actions.  Ante, at 15, n.\xc2\xa08.  And when an employer \xe2\x80\x9cconcentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few individuals\xe2\x80\x9d who rely on information from \xe2\x80\x9cother workers who actually interact with the affected employee,\xe2\x80\x9d the other workers may rank as supervisors (or maybe not; the Court does not commit one way or the other).

Can any economic consequence make a reassignment or disciplinary action \xe2\x80\x9csignificant,\xe2\x80\x9d or is there a minimum threshold?  How concentrated must the decisionmaking authority be to deem those not formally endowed with that authority nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9csupervisors\xe2\x80\x9d?  The Court leaves these questions unanswered, and its liberal use of \xe2\x80\x9cmights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmays,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15, n.\xc2\xa08, 16, n.\xc2\xa09, 26, dims the light it casts.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat the Court has adopted a standard, rather than a clear rule, is not surprising, for no crisp definition of supervisor could supply the unwavering line the Court desires.  Supervisors, like the workplaces they manage, come in all shapes and sizes.  Whether a pitching coach supervises his pitchers (can he demote them?), or an artistic director supervises her opera star (can she impose significantly different responsibilities?), or a law firm associate supervises the firm\xe2\x80\x99s paralegals (can she fire them?) are matters not susceptible to mechanical rules and on-off switches.  One cannot know whether an employer has vested supervisory authority in an employee, and whether harassment is aided by that authority, without looking to the particular working relationship between the harasser and the victim.  That is why Faragher and Ellerth crafted an employer liability standard embracive of all whose authority significantly aids in the creation and perpetuation of harassment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s focus on finding a definition of supervisor capable of instant application is at odds with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary emphasis on the importance of particular circumstances in Title VII cases.  See, e.g., Burlington Northern, 548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 69 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d); Harris, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 23 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether an environment is \xe2\x80\x98hostile\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98abusive\xe2\x80\x99 can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The question of supervisory status, no less than the question whether retali-ation or harassment has occurred, \xe2\x80\x9cdepends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oncale, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 81\xe2\x80\x9382.

This realignment will leave many harassment victims without an effective remedy and undermine Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to prevent workplace harassment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe negligence standard allowed by the Court, see ante, at 24, scarcely affords the protection the Faragher and Ellerth framework gave victims harassed by those in control of their lives at work.  Recall that an employer is negligent with regard to harassment only if it knew or should have known of the conduct but failed to take appropriate corrective action.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71604.11(d); EEOC Guidance 405:7652 to 405:7653.  It is not uncommon for employers to lack actual or constructive notice of a harassing employee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  See Lindemann &amp; Grossman 1378\xe2\x80\x931379.  An employee may have a reputation as a harasser among those in his vicinity, but if no complaint makes its way up to management, the employer will escape liability under a negligence standard.  Id., at 1378.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFaragher is illustrative.  After enduring unrelenting harassment, Faragher reported Terry\xe2\x80\x99s and Silverman\xe2\x80\x99s conduct informally to Robert Gordon, another immediate supervisor.  524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 782\xe2\x80\x93783.  But the lifeguards were \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely isolated from the City\xe2\x80\x99s higher management,\xe2\x80\x9d and it did not occur to Faragher to pursue the matter with higher ranking city officials distant from the beach.  Id., at 783, 808 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying a negligence standard, the Eleventh Circuit held that, despite the pervasiveness of the harassment, and despite Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of it, Boca Raton lacked constructive notice and therefore escaped liability.  Id., at 784\xe2\x80\x93785.  Under the vicarious liability standard, however, Boca Raton could not make out the affirmative defense, for it had failed to disseminate a policy against sexual harassment.  Id., at 808\xe2\x80\x93809.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn top of the substantive differences in the negligence and vicarious liability standards, harassment victims, under today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, are saddled with the burden of proving the employer\xe2\x80\x99s negligence whenever the harasser lacks the power to take tangible employment actions.  Faragher and Ellerth, by contrast, placed the burden squarely on the employer to make out the affirmative defense.  See Suders, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146 (citing Ellerth, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 765; Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 807).  This allocation of the burden was both sensible and deliberate: An employer has superior access to evidence bearing on whether it acted reasonably to prevent or correct harassing behavior, and superior resources to marshal that evidence.  See 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe employer is in the best position to know what remedial procedures it offers to employees and how those procedures operate.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFaced with a steeper substantive and procedural hill to climb, victims like Yasharay Mack, Donna Rhodes, Clara Whitten, and Monika Starke likely will find it impossible to obtain redress.  We can expect that, as a consequence of restricting the supervisor category to those formally empowered to take tangible employment actions, victims of workplace harassment with meritorious Title VII claims will find suit a hazardous endeavor.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInevitably, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of supervisor will hinder efforts to stamp out discrimination in the workplace.  Because supervisors are comparatively few, and employees are many, \xe2\x80\x9cthe employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers,\xe2\x80\x9d and a greater incentive to \xe2\x80\x9cscreen [supervisors], train them, and monitor their performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Faragher, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 803.  Vicarious liability for employers serves this end.  When employers know they will be answerable for the injuries a harassing jobsite boss inflicts, their incentive to provide preventative instruction is heightened.  If vicarious liability is confined to supervisors formally empowered to take tangible employment actions, however, employers will have a diminished incentive to train those who control their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 work activities and schedules, i.e., the supervisors who \xe2\x80\x9cactually interact\xe2\x80\x9d with employees.

Maetta Vance worked as substitute server and part-time catering assistant for Ball State University\xe2\x80\x99s Banquet and Catering Division.  During the period in question, she alleged, Saundra Davis, a catering specialist, and other Ball State employees subjected her to a racially hostile work environment.  Applying controlling Circuit precedent, the District Court and Seventh Circuit concluded that Davis was not Vance\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor, and reviewed Ball State\xe2\x80\x99s liability for her conduct under a negligence standard.  646 F.\xc2\xa03d 461, 470\xe2\x80\x93471 (2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\xe2\x80\x9355a, 59a\xe2\x80\x9360a.  Because I would hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in restrict- ing supervisor status to employees formally empowered to take tangible employment actions, I would remand for application of the proper standard to Vance\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  On this record, however, there is cause to anticipate that Davis would not qualify as Vance\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSupervisor status is based on \xe2\x80\x9cjob function rather than job title,\xe2\x80\x9d and depends on \xe2\x80\x9cspecific facts\xe2\x80\x9d about the working relationship.  EEOC Guidance 405:7654.  See supra, at 13.  Vance has adduced scant evidence that Davis controlled the conditions of her daily work.  Vance stated in an affidavit that the general manager of the Catering Division, Bill Kimes, was charged with \xe2\x80\x9coverall supervision in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9creassign[ing] people to perform different tasks,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol[ling] the schedule.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 431.

There is no allegation that Davis had a hand in creating these prep lists, nor is there any indication that, in fact, Davis otherwise controlled the particulars of Vance\xe2\x80\x99s workday.  Vance herself testified that she did not know whether Davis was her supervisor.

But because the supervisor-status inquiry should focus on substance, not labels or paper descriptions, it is doubtful that this slim evidence would enable Vance to survive a motion for summary judgment.  Nevertheless, I would leave it to the Seventh Circuit to decide, under the proper standard for super-visory status, what impact, if any, Davis\xe2\x80\x99 job description and the co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s statement should have on the determination of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 status.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRegrettably, the Court has seized upon Vance\xe2\x80\x99s thin case to narrow the definition of supervisor, and thereby manifestly limit Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s protections against workplace harassment.

His authority to hire was subject to approval by higher management, Faragher v. Boca Raton, \n, and there is scant indication that he possessed other powers on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s list.

Ante, at 15, n.\xc2\xa08 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nothing in the Faragher record, however, shows that Terry had authority to take such actions himself.  Far-agher\xe2\x80\x99s complaint alleged that Terry said he would never promote a female lifeguard to the rank of lieutenant, 524 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 780, but that statement hardly suffices to establish that he had ultimate promotional authority.  Had Boca Raton anticipated the position the Court today announces, the city might have urged classification of Terry as Far-agher\xe2\x80\x99s superior, but not her \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The illustrative cases reached the appellate level after grants of summary judgment in favor of the employer.

Even under a vicarious liability rule, the Court points out, employers might escape liability for reasons other than the harasser\xe2\x80\x99s status as supervisor.  For example, Rhodes might have avoided summary judgment in favor of her employer; even so, it would have been open to the employer to raise and prove to a jury the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense, see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  No doubt other bar-riers also might impede an employee from prevailing, for example, Whitten\xe2\x80\x99s and Starke\xe2\x80\x99s intervening bankruptcies, see Whitten v.

But the Court can point to no evidence that jury instructions on supervisor status in jurisdictions following the EEOC Guidance have in fact proved unworkable or confusing to jurors.  Moreover, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of supervisor, jurors in many cases will be obliged to determine, as a threshold question, whether the alleged harasser possessed supervisory authority.

The Seventh Circuit declined to address this issue.  See 646 F.\xc2\xa03d 461, 471 (2011).
