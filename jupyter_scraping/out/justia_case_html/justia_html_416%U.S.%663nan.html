JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented is whether the Constitution is violated by application to appellee, the lessor of a yacht, of Puerto Rican statutes providing for seizure and forfeiture of vessels used for unlawful purposes when (1) the yacht was seized without prior notice or hearing after allegedly being used by a lessee for an unlawful purpose, and (2) the appellee was neither involved in nor aware of the act of the lessee which resulted in the forfeiture. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 416 U. S. 665</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In March, 1971, appellee, Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., leased a pleasure yacht to two Puerto Rican residents.  Puerto Rican authorities discovered marihuana on board the yacht in early May, 1972, and charged one of the lessees with violation of the Controlled Substances Act of Puerto Rico, P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24 \xc2\xa7 2101 <em>et seq.</em> (Supp. 1973).  On July 11, 1972, the Superintendent of Police seized the yacht pursuant to P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24 \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2512(a)(4), (b) (Supp. 1973), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and Tit. 34 \xc2\xa7 1722 (1971), [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] which provide that vessels used to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="666">Page 416 U. S. 666</a></p><p> transport, or to facilitate the transportation of, controlled substances, including marihuana, are subject to seizure and forfeiture to the Commonwealth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="667">Page 416 U. S. 667</a></p><p> of Puerto Rico.  The vessel was seized without prior notice to appellee or either lessee, and without a prior adversary hearing.  The lessees, who had registered the yacht with the Ports Authority of the Commonwealth, were thereafter given notice within 10 days of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="668">Page 416 U. S. 668</a></p><p> seizure as required by \xc2\xa7 1722(a). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  But when a challenge to the seizure was not made within 15 days after service of the notice, the yacht was forfeited for official use of the Government of Puerto Rico pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1722(C). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Appellee shortly thereafter first learned of the seizure and forfeiture when attempting to repossess the yacht from the lessees because of their apparent failure to pay rent.  It is conceded that appellee was "in no way . . . involved in the criminal enterprise carried on by [the] lessee," and "had no knowledge that its property was being used in connection with or in violation of [Puerto Rican Law]."</p>\n<p>On November 6, 1972, appellee filed this suit, seeking a declaration that application of P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2512(a)(4), (b), and Tit. 34, \xc2\xa7 1722, had (1) unconstitutionally denied it due process of law insofar as the statutes authorized appellants, the Superintendent of Police and the Chief of the Office of Transportation of the Commonwealth, to seize the yacht without notice or a prior adversary hearing, and (2) unconstitutionally deprived appellee of its property without just compensation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Injunctive relief was also sought. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="669">Page 416 U. S. 669</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A three-judge District Court, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] relying principally upon <em>Fuentes v. Shevin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html">407 U. S. 67</a></span> (1972), held that the failure of the statutes to provide for pre-seizure notice and hearing rendered them constitutionally defective.  363 F.Supp. 1337, 1342-1343 (PR 1973).  Viewing <em>United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/715/case.html">401 U. S. 715</a></span> (1971), as having effectively overruled our prior decisions that the property owner\'s innocence has no constitutional significance for purposes of forfeiture, the District Court further declared that the Puerto Rican statutes, insofar as applied to forfeit appellee\'s interest in the yacht, unconstitutionally deprived it of property without just compensation.  363 F.Supp. at 1341-1342.  Appellants were accordingly enjoined from enforcing the statutes</p>\n<p>"insofar as they deny the owner or person in charge of property an opportunity for a hearing due to the lack of notice, before the seizure and forfeiture of its property and insofar as a penalty is imposed upon innocent parties."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1343-1344.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/14/case.html#16">414 U. S. 16</a></span> (1973).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the parties consented to the convening of the three-judge court, and hence do not challenge our jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="670">Page 416 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We therefore turn first to that question.</p>\n<p>In <em>Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/368/case.html">336 U. S. 368</a></span> (1949), this Court held that enactments of the Territory of Hawaii were not "State statute[s]" for purposes of Judicial Code \xc2\xa7 266, the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281, reasoning:</p>\n<p>"While, of course, great respect is to be paid to the enactments of a territorial legislature by all courts as it is to the adjudications of territorial courts, the predominant reason for the enactment of Judicial Code \xc2\xa7 266 does not exist as respects territories.  <em>This reason was a congressional purpose to avoid unnecessary interference with the laws of a sovereign state.</em>  In our dual system of government, the position of the state as sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution requires a deference to state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 416 U. S. 671</a></p><p> legislative action beyond that required for the laws of a territory.  A territory is subject to congressional regulation."</p>\n<p>336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/368/case.html#377">336 U. S. 377</a></span>-378 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).  Similar reasoning -- that the purpose of insulating a sovereign State\'s laws from interference by a single judge would not be furthered by broadly interpreting the word "State" -- led the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, some 55 years ago, to hold \xc2\xa7 266 inapplicable to the laws of the Territory of Puerto Rico.  <em>Benedicto v. West India &amp; Panama Tel. Co.,</em> 256 F. 417 (1919).</p>\n<p>Congress, however, created the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico after <em>Benedicto</em> was decided.  Following the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was ceded to this country in the Treaty of Paris, 30 Stat. 1754 (1898).  A brief interlude of military control was followed by congressional enactment of a series of Organic Acts for the government of the island.  Initially, these enactments established a local governmental structure with high officials appointed by the President.  These Acts also retained veto power in the President and Congress over local legislation.  By 1950, however, pressures for greater autonomy led to congressional enactment of Pub.L. 600, 64 Stat. 319, which offered the people of Puerto Rico a compact whereby they might establish a government under their own constitution.  Puerto Rico accepted the compact, and on July 3, 1952, Congress approved, with minor amendments, a constitution adopted by the Puerto Rican populace, 66 Stat. 327; <em>see</em> note accompanying 48 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 731d.  Pursuant to that constitution, the Commonwealth now</p>\n<p>"elects its Governor and legislature; appoints its judges, all cabinet officials, and lesser officials in the executive branch; sets its own educational policies; determines its own budget; and amends its own civil and criminal code."</p>\n<p>Leibowitz, The Applicability of Federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 416 U. S. 672</a></p><p> Law to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 56 Geo.L.J. 219, 221 (1967); <em>see</em> 28 Dept. of State Bull. 584589 (1953); <em>Americana of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Kaplus,</em> 368 F.2d 431 (CA3 1966); Magruder, The Commonwealth Status of Puerto Rico, 15 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 1 (1953).</p>\n<p>These significant changes in Puerto Rico\'s governmental structure formed the backdrop to Judge Magruder\'s observations in <em>Mora v. Mejias,</em> 206 F.2d 377 (CA1 1953):</p>\n<p>"[I]t may be that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -- \'El Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico\' in the Spanish version -- organized as a body politic by the people of Puerto Rico under their own constitution, pursuant to the terms of the compact offered to them in Pub.L. 600, and by them accepted, is a State within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281.  The preamble to this constitution refers to the Commonwealth . . . which, \'in the exercise of our natural rights, we [the people of Puerto Rico] now create within our union with the United States of America.\'  Puerto Rico has thus not become a State in the federal Union like the 48 States, but it would seem to have become a State within a common and accepted meaning of the word.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/us/74/700/case.html#720">74 U. S. </a></span> White,</em> 1868, 7 Wall. 700,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/74/700/case.html#721">74 U. S. 721</a></span>. . . .  It is a political entity created by the act and with the consent of the people of Puerto Rico and joined in union with the United States of America under the terms of the compact."</p>\n<p>"A serious argument could therefore be made that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a State within the intendment and policy of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281. . . .  If the constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is really a \'constitution\' -- as the Congress says it is, 66 Stat. 327 -- and not just another Organic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 416 U. S. 673</a></p><p> Act approved and enacted by the Congress, then the question is whether the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is to be deemed \'sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution\' of the United States, and thus a \'state\' within the policy of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281, which enactment, in prescribing a three-judge federal district court, expresses \'a deference to state legislative action beyond that required for the laws of a territory\' [<em>Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po,</em> 336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/336/368/case.html#378">336 U. S. 378</a></span>] whose local affairs are subject to congressional regulation."</p>\n<p>206 F.2d at 387-388 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Lower federal courts since 1953 have adopted this analysis and concluded that Puerto Rico is to be deemed "sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution," and thus a State within the policy of the Three-Judge Court Act.  <em>See Mora v. Mejias,</em> 115 F.Supp. 610 (PR 1953); [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] <em>Marin v. University of Puerto Rico,</em> 346 F.Supp. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 416 U. S. 674</a></p><p> 470, 481 (PR 1972); <em>Suarez v. Administrador del Deporte Hipico de Puerto Rico,</em> 354 F.Supp. 320 (PR 1972).  And in <em>Wackenhut Corp. v. Aponte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/268/case.html">386 U. S. 268</a></span> (1967), we summarily affirmed the decision of a three-judge court for the District of Puerto Rico that had ordered abstention and said:</p>\n<p>"[A]pplication of the doctrine of abstention is particularly appropriate in a case . . . involv[ing] the construction and validity of a statute of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  For a due regard for the status of that Commonwealth under its compact with the Congress of the United States dictates, we believe, that it should have the primary opportunity through its courts to determine the intended scope of its own legislation and to pass upon the validity of that legislation under its own constitution, as well as under the Constitution of the United States."</p>\n<p>266 F.Supp. 401, 405 (1966).  Although the question of Puerto Rico\'s status under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 was raised in neither the Jurisdictional Statement nor the Motion to Affirm in <em>Wackenhut,</em> and we do not normally feel ourselves bound by a <em>sub silentio</em> exercise of jurisdiction, <em>see Hagans v.

This is particularly so, when as in <em>Wackenhut,</em> the opinion supporting the judgment over which we exercised appellate jurisdiction had expressed the view that abstention was appropriate for reasons of comity, an oft-repeated justification for the abstention doctrine, <em>see, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U.

A writ of replevin could be obtained under the Florida statute upon the creditor\'s bare assertion to a court clerk that he was entitled to the property, and under the Pennsylvania statute, upon filing an affidavit fixing the value of the property, without alleging legal entitlement to the property.  <em>Fuentes</em> held that the statutory procedures deprived debtors of their property without due process by failing to provide for hearings "<em>at a meaningful time.\'"  407 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html#80">407 U.

Such circumstances are those in which</p>\n<p>"the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest.  Second, there has been a special need for very prompt action.  Third, the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force:  the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html#91">407 U.

S. 547</a></span> (1921).</p>\n<p>The considerations that justified postponement of notice and hearing in those cases are present here.  First, seizure under the Puerto Rican statutes serves significant governmental purposes:  seizure permits Puerto Rico to assert <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction over the property in order to conduct forfeiture proceedings, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions.  Second, pre-seizure notice and hearing might frustrate the interests served by the statutes, since the property seized -- as here, a yacht -- will often be of a sort that could be removed to another jurisdiction, destroyed, or concealed if advance warning of confiscation were given.  And finally, unlike the situation in <em>Fuentes,</em> seizure is not initiated by self-interested private parties; rather, Commonwealth officials determine whether seizure is appropriate under the provisions of the Puerto Rican statutes. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In these circumstances, we hold that this case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 416 U. S. 680</a></p><p> presents an "extraordinary" situation in which postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure did not deny due process. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants next argue that the District Court erred in holding that the forfeiture statutes unconstitutionally authorized the taking for government use of innocent parties\' property without just compensation.  They urge that a long line of prior decisions of this Court establish the principle that statutory forfeiture schemes are not rendered unconstitutional because of their applicability to the property interests of innocents, and further that <em>United States v. United States Coin 7 Currency,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/715/case.html">401 U. S. 715</a></span> (1971), did not -- contrary to the opinion of the District Court -- overrule those prior precedents <em>sub silentio.</em>  We agree.  The historical background of forfeiture statutes in this country and this Court\'s prior decisions sustaining their constitutionality lead to that conclusion.</p>\n<p>At common law, the value of an inanimate object directly or indirectly causing the accidental death of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 416 U. S. 681</a></p><p> King\'s subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The origins of the deodand are traceable to Biblical [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and pre-Judeo-Christian practices, which reflected the view that the instrument of death was accused and that religious expiation was required.  <em>See</em> O. Holmes, The Common Law, c. 1 (1881).  The value of the instrument was forfeited to the King in the belief that the King would provide the money for Masses to be said for the good of the dead man\'s soul, or insure that the deodand was put to charitable uses.  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *300. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  When application of the deodand to religious or eleemosynary purposes ceased, and the deodand became a source of Crown revenue, the institution was justified as a penalty for carelessness. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="682">Page 416 U. S. 682</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Forfeiture also resulted at common law from conviction for felonies and treason.  The convicted felon forfeited his chattels to the Crown, and his lands escheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of his property, real and personal, to the Crown.  <em>See</em> 3 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 68-71 (3d ed.1927); 1 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, History of English Law 351 (2d ed.1909).  The basis for these forfeitures was that a breach of the criminal law was an offense to the King\'s peace, which was felt to justify denial of the right to own property.  <em>See</em> 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *299. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, English Law provided for statutory forfeitures of offending objects used in violation of the customs and revenue laws -- likely a product of the confluence and merger of the deodand tradition and the belief that the right to own property could be denied the wrongdoer.  Statutory forfeitures were most often enforced under the <em>in rem</em> procedure utilized in the Court of Exchequer to forfeit the property of felons.  <em>See</em> 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *261-262; <em>C.J. Hendry Co. v. Moore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/133/case.html">318 U.

S. 137</a></span>-138 (1943).</p>\n<p>Deodands did not become part of the common law tradition of this country.  <em>See Parker-Harris Co. v. Tate,</em> 135 Tenn. 509, 188 S.W. 54 (1916).  Nor has forfeiture </p><p><a class="page-number" name="683">Page 416 U. S. 683</a></p><p> of estates as a consequence of federal criminal conviction been permitted, <em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3563; Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5326 (1874); 1 Stat. 117 (1790).  Forfeiture of estates resulting from a conviction for treason has been constitutionally proscribed by Art. III, \xc2\xa7 3, though forfeitures of estates for the lifetime of a traitor have been sanctioned, <em>see Wallach v. Van Riswick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/202/case.html">92 U. S. 202</a></span> (1876).  But</p>\n<p>"[l]ong before the adoption of the Constitution, the common law courts in the Colonies -- and later in the states during the period of Confederation -- were exercising jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> in the enforcement of [English and local] forfeiture statutes,"</p>\n<p><em>C.J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/133/case.html#139">318 U. S. 139</a></span>, which provided for the forfeiture of commodities and vessels used in violations of customs and revenue laws.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/133/case.html#145">318 U.

And almost immediately after adoption of the Constitution, ships and cargoes involved in customs offenses were made subject to forfeiture under federal law, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] as were vessels used to deliver slaves to foreign countries, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and, somewhat later, those used to deliver slaves to this country. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The enactment of forfeiture statutes has not abated; contemporary federal and state forfeiture statutes reach virtually any type of property that might be used in the conduct of a criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p>Despite this proliferation of forfeiture enactments, the innocence of the owner of property subject to forfeiture has almost uniformly been rejected as a defense.  Thus, Mr. Justice Story observed in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/1/case.html">The Palmyra,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 1 (1827), that a conviction for piracy was not a prerequisite </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 416 U. S. 684</a></p><p> to a proceeding to forfeit a ship allegedly engaged in piratical aggression in violation of a federal statute:</p>\n<p>"It is well known, that, at the common law, in many cases of felonies, the party forfeited his goods and chattels to the crown.  The forfeiture did not, strictly speaking, attach <em>in rem,</em> but it was a part, or at least a consequence, of the judgment of conviction. . . .  [T]he [Crown\'s right to the goods and chattels] attached only by the conviction of the offender. . . .  But this doctrine never was applied to seizures and forfeitures, created by statute, <em>in rem,</em> cognizable on the revenue side of the Exchequer.  The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing, and this, whether the offence be <em>malum prohibitum</em> or <em>malum in se.</em> . . .   [T]he practice has been, and so this Court understand the law to be, that the proceeding <em>in rem</em> stands independent of, and wholly unaffected by, any criminal proceeding <em>in personam.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/1/case.html#14">25 U. S. 14</a></span>-15.  This rationale was relied upon to sustain the statutory forfeiture of a vessel found to have been engaged in piratical conduct where the innocence of the owner was "fully established."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/210/case.html">United States v.

That case involved a lessee\'s violations of the revenue laws which led to the seizure of real and personal property used in connection with a distillery.  The lessor\'s assertions of innocence were rejected as a defense to a federal statutory forfeiture of his entire property, for the offense</p>\n<p>"attached primarily to the distillery, and the real and personal property used in connection with the same, without any regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner beyond what necessarily arises from the fact that he leased the property to the distiller and suffered it to be occupied and used by the lessee as a distillery."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/395/case.html#401">96 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/505/case.html">254 U. S. 505</a></span> (1921), it was held that the federal tax fraud forfeiture statute did not deprive an innocent owner of his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  There, the claimant was a conditional vendor of a taxicab that had been used in the removal and concealment of distilled spirits upon which the federal tax was unpaid.  Although recognizing that arguments against the application of the statute to cover an innocent owner were not without force, the Court rejected them, saying:</p>\n<p>"In breaches of revenue provisions, some forms of property are facilities, and therefore it may be said that Congress interposes the care and responsibility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 416 U. S. 686</a></p><p> of their owners in aid of the prohibitions of the law and its punitive provisions, by ascribing to the property a certain personality, a power of complicity and guilt in the wrong.  In such case, there is some analogy to the law of deodand, by which a personal chattel that was the immediate cause of the death of any reasonable creature was forfeited.  To the superstitious reason to which the rule was ascribed, Blackstone adds \'that such misfortunes are, in part ,owing to the negligence of the owner, and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture.\' . . ."</p>\n<p>"But whether the reason for [the forfeiture] be artificial or real, it is too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/505/case.html#510">254 U.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Forfeiture of conveyances that have been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 416 U.

No. 1054, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939); S.Rep. No. 926, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939); H.R.Rep. No. 2751, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950); S.Rep. No. 1755, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  To the extent that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 416 U. S. 688</a></p><p> such forfeiture provisions are applied to lessors, bailors, or secured creditors who are innocent of any wrongdoing, confiscation may have the desirable effect of inducing them to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property.  <em>Cf. United States v. One Ford Coach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/219/case.html">307 U.

Against the legitimate governmental interests served by the Puerto Rican statute and the long line of this Court\'s decisions which squarely collide with appellee\'s assertion of a constitutional violation, the District Court opposed our decision in <em>United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/715/case.html">401 U. S. 715</a></span> (1971).  This reliance was misplaced.  In <em>Coin &amp; Currency,</em> the Government claimed that the privilege against self-incrimination could not be asserted in a forfeiture proceeding under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7302 by one in possession of money seized from him when used in an illegal bookmaking operation.  In the Government\'s view, the proceeding was not "criminal" because the forfeiture was authorized without regard to the guilt or innocence of the owner of the money.  The Court\'s answer was that \xc2\xa7 7302, read in conjunction with 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1618, manifested a clear intention "to impose a penalty only upon those who [were] significantly involved in a criminal enterprise," 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/715/case.html#721">401 U. S. 721</a></span>-722, and, in that circumstance, the privilege could be asserted in the forfeiture proceeding by the person from whom the money was taken.  Thus, <em>Coin &amp; Currency</em> did not overrule prior decisions that sustained application to innocents of forfeiture statutes, like the Puerto Rican statutes, not limited in application to persons "significantly involved in a criminal enterprise."  This is not to say, however, that the "broad sweep" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 416 U. S. 689</a></p><p> of forfeiture statutes remarked in <em>Coin &amp; Currency</em> could not, in other circumstances, give rise to serious constitutional questions.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall intimated as much over a century and a half ago in observing that</p>\n<p>"a forfeiture can only be applied to those cases in which the means that are prescribed for the prevention of a forfeiture may be employed."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/347/case.html">Peisch v.

It therefore has been implied that it would be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of an owner whose property subjected to forfeiture had been taken from him without his privity or consent.  <em>See, id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/347/case.html#364">8 U.

Similarly, the same might be said of an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property; [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] for, in that circumstance, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 416 U.

We noted that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1258, requiring that we permit final judgments of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be reviewed by appeal or by certiorari, directly corresponded to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 providing for review of final judgments of "state" courts.  Since no parallel provision was added to \xc2\xa7 1254(2) to permit appeals from the courts of appeals holding Puerto Rican statutes unconstitutional, we said:</p>\n<p>"Whether the omission was by accident or by design, our practice of strict construction of statutes authorizing appeals dictates that we not give an expansive interpretation to the word \'state.\'"</p>\n<p>400 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/41/case.html#42">400 U. S. 42</a></span> n. 1.</p>\n<p>This conclusion seems compelled by the history of the close relationship between 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(2) and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257.  In the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 85-86, final decisions of state courts sustaining state statutes against challenges under the Federal Constitution were subjected to review by this Court on writ of error.  <em>See King Mfg. Co. v. City Council of Augusta,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/100/case.html">277 U. S. 100</a></span> (1928).  But, prior to 1925, there was no appeal from "final" judgments of the federal circuit courts.  <em>See</em> 36 Stat. 1157 (1911).  When consideration was being given to amendment of the Judiciary Act in 1924 and 1925</p>\n<p>"[a]ttention was drawn to the disparity between the want of obligatory review over [decisions of the circuit courts involving the constitutionality of state statutes] and the existence of obligatory jurisdiction over a similar class of cases in the state courts.  Senator Copeland rehearsed before the Senate correspondence he had had on this point with the Chief Justice, who had urged that, if it was desirable to put the circuit courts of appeals on the same level with the state courts, it would be better to withdraw review as of right from the state courts and subject the decisions of both the state courts and the circuit courts solely to a discretionary review by the Supreme Court, rather than to allow obligatory review over all constitutional cases from both courts.  The Chief Justice, however, justified the proposed discrimination on the ground that a circuit court of appeals, in deciding a federal constitutional question,"</p>\n<p>"would be more likely to preserve the Federal view of the issue than the State court, at least to an extent to justify making a review of its decision by our court conditional upon our approval."</p>\n<p>"However, an amendment prevailed which met this discrimination by allowing writ of error to the circuit courts of appeals in cases sustaining a constitutional claim against a state statute.  The argument advanced by the Chief Justice thus became the basis for a new development of the principle which, since 1789, had been the basis of Supreme Court review of the highest courts of the states.  Due to the belief that the state courts would be more jealous of local rights than of federal claims review had lain as of right where the constitutional claim was advanced and denied.  Now, due to the belief . . . that the federal court would sustain constitutional claims as opposed to the local right, review was provided from the circuit courts of appeals where the constitutional claim was advanced and allowed.  Thereby, the Senate"</p>\n<p>"intended to put the two on a perfect parity, allowing a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals under conditions exactly the same, except reversed, and allowing a writ of certiorari in the one case as in the other case, so that the two would be entirely harmonious."</p>\n<p>F. Frankfurter &amp; J. Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court 277-278 (1928) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, against that background, when Congress made \xc2\xa7 1258 only a counterpart of \xc2\xa7 1257, there could be no basis for an expansive reading of the word "State" in \xc2\xa7 1254(2), in the absence of its congressional amendment.</p>\n<p>We have no occasion to address the question whether Puerto Rico is a "State" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, a jurisdictional basis of appellee\'s complaint.  Since the complaint and lease agreement, as incorporated, fairly read, leave little doubt that the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000 and arises under the Constitution of the United States, there is jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants also argue that the seizure did not result in any injury to appellee that constituted failure of pre-seizure notice and hearing a denial of due process.  This is so, they contend, because the lease gave the lessees exclusive right to possession at the time of the seizure, and therefore appellee\'s nonpossessory interest was adequately protected by the statutory provisions for a post-seizure hearing.  But the lease provides that lessees\' failure, <em>inter alia,</em> within 15 days after notice from appellee to pay arrears of rent or use the yacht solely for legal purposes would establish a default entitling appellee to possession.  Whether a default had in fact occurred between May 6, 1972, when a lessee was first accused of a narcotics violation, and the date of seizure, July 11, 1972, is not clear from the record, although it is clear that appellee did not attempt to repossess the yacht until October 19, 1972.</p>\n<p>Since, however, our holding is that pre-seizure notice and hearing are not required by due process in the context of this forfeiture, we have no occasion to remand for a determination (1) whether the company had an immediate, but as yet unexercised, right to possession on the date of seizure or merely a right to collect rents, together with a reversionary interest and (2) whether either or both of these property interests would be of sufficient significance to require that the company be given an advance opportunity to contest the seizure.  <em>Cf.

These provisions are also extended to those individuals holding chattel mortgages or conditional sales contracts.  19 CFR \xc2\xa7 171.13(b).  <em>See also</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3617(b), establishing standards for judicial remission and mitigation of forfeitures resulting from violations of the internal revenue laws relating to liquor.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE POWELL Joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion, and agree that there was no constitutional necessity under <em>Fuentes v. Shevin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html">407 U. S. 67</a></span> (1972), or any other case in this Court to accord the owner-lessor of the yacht a hearing in the circumstances of this case.  I add, however, that the presence of important public interests which permits dispensing with a pre-seizure hearing in the instant case is only one of the situations in which no prior hearing is required.  <em>See Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/600/case.html">416 U. S. 600</a></span>; <em>Arnett v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I agree that Puerto Rico is a State for purposes of the three-judge court jurisdiction, I dissent on the merits.</p>\n<p>The discovery of marihuana on the yacht took place May 6, 1972.  The seizure of the yacht took place on July 11, 1972 -- over two months later.  In view of the long delay in making the seizure where is that "special need for very prompt action" which we emphasized in <em>Fuentes v. Shevin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html">407 U. S. 67</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html#91">407 U. S. 91</a></span>?  The Court cites instances of exigent circumstances -- seized poisoned food, dangerous drugs, failure of a bank, and the like.  But they are inapt.</p>\n<p><em>Fuentes v. Shevin,</em> involved a contest between debtor and creditor and a resolution of private property rights not implicated in an important governmental purpose.  Here, important governmental purposes are involved.  As </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 416 U. S. 692</a></p><p> to that type of case, we said in <em>Fuentes:</em></p>\n<p>"First, in each case, the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest.  Second, there has been a special need for very prompt action.  Third, the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force:  the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance.  Thus, the Court has allowed summary seizure of property to collect the internal revenue of the United States, to meet the needs of a national war effort, to protect against the economic disaster of a bank failure, and to protect the public from misbranded drugs and contaminated food."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html#91">407 U. S. 91</a></span>-92.</p>\n<p>Postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure of the vessel apparently was not needed here, as the District Court held.  Yet, after that two-month delay, forfeiture of the vessel is ordered without notice to the owner and without just compensation for the taking.  On those premises, this is the classic case of lack of procedural due process.</p>\n<p>The owner on the record before us was wholly innocent of knowing that the lessee was using the vessel illegally.  To analogize this case to the old cases of forfeiture of property of felons is peculiarly inappropriate.  Nor is this a case where owner and lessee are "in cahoots" in a smuggling venture or negligent in any way.  The law does provide for forfeitures of property even of the innocent.  But as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/347/case.html">Peisch v. Ware,</a></span></em> 4 Cranch 347,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/347/case.html#365">8 U. S. 365</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"[T]he law is not understood to forfeit the property of owners or consignees, on account of the misconduct of mere strangers, over whom such owners or consignees could have no control."</p>\n<p>The lessee of the vessel was, of course, no stranger.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="693">Page 416 U. S. 693</a></p><p> Here unlike <em>United States v. One Ford Coach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/219/case.html">307 U. S. 219</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/219/case.html#238">307 U. S. 238</a></span>-239 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting), there is no suggestion that the lessee was a mere strawman for runners of drugs.  Even where such ambiguous circumstances were present, the Court refused to impose forfeiture of an auto running illegal whiskey and belonging to those who acted "in good faith and without negligence."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/219/case.html#236">307 U. S. 236</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The present case is one of extreme hardship.  The District Court found that the owner</p>\n<p>"did not know that its property was being used for an illegal purpose, and was completely innocent of the lessee\'s criminal act.  After the seizure and within the time allowed by law, the Superintendent [of the Police] notified lessee.  Plaintiff was never notified, and, since lessee did not post bond, the yacht was forfeited to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  It was not until plaintiff attempted to recover possession of the yacht after lessee had defaulted in the rental payments that plaintiff learned of its forfeiture."</p>\n<p>363 F.Supp. 1337, 1340.  Moreover, the owner had included in the lease a prohibition against use of the yacht for an unlawful project.</p>\n<p>If the yacht had been notoriously used in smuggling drugs, those who claim forfeiture might have equity on their side.  But no such showing was made, and, so far as we know, only one marihuana cigarette was found on the yacht.  We deal here with trivia where harsh judge-made law should be tempered with justice.  I realize that the ancient law is founded on the fiction that the inanimate object itself is guilty of wrongdoing.  <em>United States v.

S. 19</a></span>.  Others are conditional, forfeiture occurring only if and when the State follows prescribed procedures.  <em>One 1968 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/693/case.html">380 U.

Some forfeiture statutes exclude from their scope property used in violation of the law as to which the owner is not "a consenting party or privy."  <em>See</em> 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1594.  Some provide for discretionary administrative or judicial relief from forfeiture if the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the owner to violate the law, 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1618, or if the owner had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that the property was used in violation of specified laws, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3617(b); <em>United States v. One Ford Coach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/219/case.html">307 U. S. 219</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico, however, has no provision for mitigation in case the owner of the seized property is wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.  And, as the Court says, these absolute, mandatory forfeiture procedures have been supported at least by much dicta in the cases.</p>\n<p>But, in my view, there was a taking of private property "for public use" under the Fifth Amendment, applied to the States by the Fourteenth, and compensation must be paid an innocent owner.  Where the owner is in no way implicated in the illegal project, I see no way to avoid paying just compensation for property taken.  I, therefore, would remand the case to the three-judge court for findings as to the innocence of the lessor of the yacht -- whether the illegal use was of such magnitude or notoriety that the owner cannot be found faultless in remaining ignorant of its occurrence. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 416 U.
