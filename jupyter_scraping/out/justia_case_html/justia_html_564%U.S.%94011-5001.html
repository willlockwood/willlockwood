In 1994, he kidnaped 16-year-old Adria Sauceda, raped her with a large stick, and bludgeoned her to death with a piece of asphalt.  He was convicted of mur-der and sentenced to death by a Texas court.  He now seeks a stay of execution on the ground that his conviction was obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 77, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820.  He relies on <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v.<em> U. S.)</em>,<em> </em>2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to notify him of his right to consular assistance.  His ar-gument is foreclosed by <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/491/index.html">552 U. S. 491</a> (2008) <em>(Medell\xc3\xadn I)</em>, in which we held that neither the <em>Avena </em>decision nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum purporting to implement that decision constituted directly enforceable federal law.  552 U. S.,<em> </em>at 498\xe2\x80\x93499.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Leal and the United States ask us to stay the execution so that Congress may consider whether to enact legislation implementing the <em>Avena </em>decision.  Leal contends that the Due Process Clause prohibits Texas from executing him while such legislation is under consideration.  This argument is meritless.  The Due Process Clause does not prohibit a State from carrying out a lawful judgment in light of unenacted legislation that might someday authorize a collateral attack on that judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States does not endorse Leal\xe2\x80\x99s due process claim.  Instead, it asks us to stay the execution until January 2012 in support of our \xe2\x80\x9cfuture jurisdiction to review the judgment in a proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d under this yet-to-be-enacted legislation.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus</em> <em>Curiae</em> 2\xe2\x80\x933, n.\xc2\xa01.  It relies on the fact that on June 14, 2011, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced implementing legislation in the Senate with the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s sup-port.  No implementing legislation has been introduced in the House.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject this suggestion.  First, we are doubtful that it is ever appropriate to stay a lower court judgment in light of unenacted legislation.  Our task is to rule on what\nthe law is, not what it might eventually be.  In light of <em>Medell\xc3\xadn I</em>, it is clear that there is no \xe2\x80\x9cfair prospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Laughlin</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2) (Breyer, J., in chambers), and our task should be at an end.  Neither the United States nor Justice Breyer, <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x936 (dissenting opinion), cites a single instance in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s history in which a stay issued under analogous circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if there were circumstances under which a stay could issue in light of proposed legislation, this case would not present them.  Medell\xc3\xadn himself sought a stay of execution on the ground that Congress might enact implementing legislation.  We denied his stay application, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our ruling in <em>[Medell\xc3\xadn I]</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/759/index.html">554 U. S. 759</a>, 760 (2008) <em>(per curiam)</em> <em>(Medell\xc3\xadn II)</em>.  It has now been seven years since the ICJ ruling and three years since our decision in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn I</em>, making a stay based on the bare introduction of a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified.  If a statute implementing <em>Avena </em>had genuinely been a priority for the political branches, it would have been enacted by now.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States and Justice Breyer complain of the grave international consequences that will follow from Leal\xe2\x80\x99s execution.  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  Congress evidently did not find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow the law as written by Congress.  We have no authority to stay an execution in light of an \xe2\x80\x9cappeal of the President,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign policy consequences, when those assertions come unaccompanied by a persuasive legal claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we noted in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn II</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he beginning premise for any stay . . . must be that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s confession was obtained unlawfully,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he United States has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at 760.  Here, the United States studiously refuses to argue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention violation, contending instead that the Court should issue a stay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be able to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court, regardless of whether his conviction will be found to be invalid.  We decline to follow the United States\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success.  We may note that in a portion of its opinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural grounds, the District Court found that any violation of the Vienna Convention would have been harmless.  <em>Leal</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, 2007 WL 4521519, *7 (WD Tex.), vacated in part <em>sub\xc2\xa0nom.</em> <em>Leal Garcia</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, 573 F.\xc2\xa03d 214, 224\xe2\x80\x93225 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The applications for stay of execution presented to Justice Scalia and by him referred to the Court are denied.

I would grant the applications and stay the execution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Solicitor General points out, Leal\xe2\x80\x99s execution at this time \xe2\x80\x9cwould place the United States in irreparable breach\xe2\x80\x9d of its \xe2\x80\x9cobligation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under international law.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1 (hereinafter U. S. Brief); see also <em>id.,</em> at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, 26, 30.  The United States has signed and ratified the Vienna Convention, a treaty under which the United States has promised, among other things, to inform an arrested foreign national, such as Leal, that he has a right to request the assistance of his country\xe2\x80\x99s consulate.  Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Art. 36, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 77, 100\xe2\x80\x93101, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820.  The United States has also signed and ratified an optional protocol, a treaty in which the United States agrees that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation of application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol), Art.\xc2\xa0I, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 325, 326, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820.  Although the United States has since given notice of withdrawal from the Optional Protocol, see Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations (Mar. 7, 2005), that withdrawal does not alter the binding status of its prewithdrawal obligations, see U. S. Brief 22, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When officials of the State of Texas arrested Leal,\nthey failed to inform him of his Vienna Convention rights, thereby placing the United States in violation of its obligations under that Convention.  And so far neither Texas nor any other judicial authority has implemented what the International Court of Justice found (in a related case brought by the Government of Mexico) to be the proper remedy for that Convention violation, namely a hearing\nto determine whether that violation amounted in effect to harmless error.  <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.)</em>, 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12, 61\xe2\x80\x9364.  See also U. S. Brief 15 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Bush acknowledged the international legal obligation created by <em>Avena</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, the international court made clear that Leal is entitled to a certain <em>procedure</em>, namely\na hearing.  That being so, a domestic court\xe2\x80\x99s guesses as\nto the results of that procedure are, as far as our treaty obligations are concerned, irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court subsequently held that, <em>because Congress had not embodied our international legal obligations in a statute</em>,<em> </em>the Court lacked the power to enforce those obligations as a matter of domestic law.  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/491/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/491/index.html">552 U. S. 491</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Court later refused to grant a stay of execution in a similar case in significant part because \xe2\x80\x9cthe President \xe2\x80\xa6 has [not] represented to us that there is any likelihood of congressional \xe2\x80\xa6 action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/759/index.html">554 U.

The Solicitor General has filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in which he states that \xe2\x80\x9cafter ex-tensive consultation with the Department of State and\nthe Department of Justice,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has introduced (and expressed an intention to hold speedy hearings on) a bill that would permit Leal and other similarly situated individuals to obtain the hearing that international law requires.  U. S. Brief 8; see <em>id.,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (describing the Consular Notification Compliance Act of 2011, S. 1194, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.).  The <em>amicus</em> brief indicates that \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional \xe2\x80\xa6 action\xe2\x80\x9d is a reasonable possibility.  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, 554 U. S., at 760.  And the Solicitor General urges this Court to grant a stay, providing Congress with adequate time to carry out the legal responsibility that this Court has held belongs to the Legislative Branch, <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/491/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/491/index.html">552 U. S. 491</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (2008), namely the enactment of a law that will bring the United States into compliance with its treaty obligations and provide Leal with the hearing that those obligations legally demand.  U. S. Brief 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the Solicitor General sets forth strong reasons, related to the conduct of foreign affairs, for granting a stay.  Representing the Executive Branch (hence\nthe President), the Solicitor General tells us that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]e-titioner\xe2\x80\x99s execution would cause irreparable harm\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cforeign-policy interests of the highest order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11.  The Solicitor General says that failing to halt Leal\xe2\x80\x99s execution would place \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States in irremediable breach of its international-law obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d with</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cserious repercussions for United States foreign relations, law-enforcement and other cooperation with Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in the event of detention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 12.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statements are supported by the fact that the Government of Mexico has also filed a brief in which it states that declining to stay Leal\xe2\x80\x99s imminent execution</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwould seriously jeopardize the ability of the Government of Mexico to continue working collaboratively with the United States on a number of joint ventures, including extraditions, mutual judicial assistance, and our efforts to strengthen our common border.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United Mexican States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has described interests of the kind set forth by the Solicitor General as \xe2\x80\x9cplainly compelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, 552 U. S., at 524; <em>id.,</em> at 537 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); see also <em>id.,</em> at 566 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (observing harms that would flow from noncompliance).  The Court has long recognized the President\xe2\x80\x99s special constitutionally based authority in matters of foreign relations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/304/index.html">299 U. S. 304</a>, 320 (1936).  And it has ordinarily given his views significant weight in such matters.  <em>Jama</em> v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/335/index.html">543 U. S. 335</a>, 348 (2005) (noting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs\xe2\x80\x9d).  It should do so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, this Court has adequate legal authority to grant the requested stay.  Should Senator Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s bill become law by the end of September (when we would consider the petition in the ordinary course), this Court would almost certainly grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with that law.  Indeed, were the Solicitor General to indicate at that time that the bill was about to become law, I believe it likely that we would hold the petition for at least several weeks until the bill was enacted and then do the same.  And this Court, under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651, can take appropriate action to preserve its \xe2\x80\x9cpotential jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Dean Foods Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/597/index.html">384 U. S. 597</a>, 603 (1966).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, on the one hand, international legal obligations, related foreign policy considerations, the prospect of legislation, and the consequent injustice involved should that legislation, coming too late for Leal, help others in identical circumstances all favor granting a stay.  And issuing a brief stay until the end of September, when the Court could consider this matter in the ordinary course, would put Congress on clear notice that it must act quickly.  On the other hand, the State has an interest in proceeding with an immediate execution.  But it is difficult to see how the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago\ncan outweigh the considerations that support additional delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently I would grant the stay that the petitioner requests.  In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court ignores the appeal of the President in a matter related\nto foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the likelihood of congressional action for the views of Executive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of Congress, and it denies the request by four Members of the Court to delay the execution until the Court can discuss the matter at Conference in September.  In my view, the Court is wrong in each respect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
