Inside, they found the house nearly barren and in disarray.  The officers smelled marijuana and observed beer bottles and cups of liquor on the floor, which was dirty.  They found a make-shift strip club in the living room, and a naked woman and several men in an upstairs bedroom.  Many party- goers scattered when they saw the uniformed officers, and some hid.  The officers questioned everyone and got inconsistent stories.  Two women identified \xe2\x80\x9cPeaches\xe2\x80\x9d as the house\xe2\x80\x99s tenant and said that she had given the partygoers permission to have the party.  But Peaches was not there.  When the officers spoke by phone to Peaches, she was nervous, agitated, and evasive.  At first, she claimed that she was renting the house and had given the partygoers permission to have the party, but she eventually admitted that she did not have permission to use the house.  The owner confirmed that he had not given anyone permission to be there.  The officers then arrested the partygoers for unlawful entry.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Several partygoers sued for false arrest under the\n \nFourth Amendment and District law.  The District Court concluded that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest the partygoers for unlawful entry and that two of the officers, petitioners here, were not entitled to qualified immunity.

Taken together, the condition of the house and the conduct of the partygoers allowed the officers to make several \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common-sense conclusions about human behavior.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Illinois v. Gates, </i>\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n.  Because most homeowners do not live in such conditions or permit such activities in their homes, the officers could infer that the partygoers knew the party was not authorized.  The officers also could infer that the partygoers knew that they were not supposed to be in the house because they scattered and hid when the officers arrived.  See <i>Illinois </i>v. <i>Wardlow</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 119\n\xe2\x80\x93125.  The partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 vague and implausible answers to questioning also gave the officers reason to infer that the partygoers were lying and that their lies suggested a guilty mind.  Cf. <i>Devenpeck </i>v. <i>Alford</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146\n\xe2\x80\x93156.  Peaches\xe2\x80\x99 lying and evasive behavior gave the officers reason to discredit everything she said.  The officers also could have inferred that she lied when she said she had invited the partygoers to the house, or that she told the partygoers that she was not actually renting the house.

First, it viewed each fact \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pringle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 372, n.\xc2\xa02.

Instead, it should have asked whether a reasonable officer could conclude\xe2\x80\x94considering all of the surrounding circumstances, including the plausibility of the explanation itself\xe2\x80\x94that there was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial chance of criminal activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Gates, supra,</i> at 244, n.\xc2\xa013.

To be clearly established, a legal principle must be \xe2\x80\x9csettled law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hunter </i>v. <i>Bryant</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224\n, and it must clearly prohibit the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the particular circumstances before him, see<i> Saucier </i>v. <i>Katz</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194\n.  In the warrantless arrest context, \xe2\x80\x9ca body of relevant case law\xe2\x80\x9d is usually necessary to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clearly establish\xe2\x80\x99 the answer\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to probable cause.  <i>Brosseau</i> v. <i>Haugen</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194\n.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Even assuming that the officers lacked actual probable cause to arrest the partygoers, they are entitled to qualified immunity because, given \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances with which [they] w[ere] confronted,\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9creasonably but mistakenly conclude[d] that probable cause [wa]s present.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Creighton</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635\n.  The panel majority and the partygoers have failed to identify a single precedent finding a\n \nFourth Amendment violation \xe2\x80\x9cunder similar circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>White </i>v<i>.

Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Instead of following this straightforward analysis, the panel majority reasoned that, under clearly established District law, a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide belief of a right to enter vitiates probable cause to arrest for unlawful entry.  Thus, it concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroverted evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of an invitation in this case meant that the officers could not infer the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 intent from other circumstances or disbelieve their story.  But looking at the entire legal landscape at the time of the arrests, a reasonable officer could have interpreted the law as permitting the arrests here.  There was no controlling case holding that a bona fide belief of a right to enter defeats probable cause, that officers cannot infer a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s guilty state of mind based on his conduct alone, or that officers must accept a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s innocent explanation at face value.

See <i>ante,</i> at 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  No arrests of plaintiffs-respondents were made until Sergeant Suber so instructed.  His instruction, when conveyed to the officers he superintended, was based on an error of law.  Sergeant Suber believed that the absence of the premises owner\xe2\x80\x99s consent, an uncontested fact in this case, sufficed to justify arrest of the partygoers for unlawful entry.  See App. 60 (Suber deposition) (officers had probable cause to arrest because \xe2\x80\x9cPeaches did not have the right, nor did the [party-goers] have the right[,] to be inside that location\xe2\x80\x9d).  An essential element of unlawful entry in the District of Columbia is that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cknew or should have known that his entry was unwanted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ortberg</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 81 A. 3d 303, 308 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 2013).  But under Sergeant Suber\xe2\x80\x99s view of the law, what the arrestees knew or should have known was irrelevant.  They could be arrested, as he comprehended the law, even if they believed their entry was invited by a lawful occupant.</p><p>Ultimately, plaintiffs-respondents were not booked for unlawful entry.  Instead, they were charged at the police station with disorderly conduct.  Yet no police officers at the site testified to having observed any activities warranting a disorderly conduct charge.  Quite the opposite.  The officers at the scene of the arrest uniformly testified that they had neither seen nor heard anything that would justify such a charge, and Sergeant Suber specifically advised his superiors that the charge was unwarranted.  See 765 F.\xc2\xa03d 13, 18 (CADC 2014); App. 56, 62\xe2\x80\x9363, 79, 84, 90, 103.</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence, I am concerned, sets the balance too heavily in favor of police unaccountability to the detriment of Fourth Amendment protection.  A number of commentators have criticized the path we charted in <i>Whren</i> v. <i>United States</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806 (1996), and follow-on opinions, holding that \xe2\x80\x9can arresting officer\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is irrelevant to the existence of probable cause,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Devenpeck</i> v. <i>Alford</i>,543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146,153 (2004).  See, <i>e.g., </i>1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa71.4(f\xc2\xa0), p. 186 (5th ed. 2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe apparent assumption of the Court in <i>Whren</i>, that no significant problem of police arbitrariness can exist as to actions taken with probable cause, blinks at reality.\xe2\x80\x9d).  I would leave open, for reexamination in a future case, whether a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s reason for acting, in at least some circumstances, should factor into the Fourth Amendment inquiry.  Given the current state of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, however, I agree that the disposition gained by plaintiffs-respondents was not warranted by \xe2\x80\x9csettled law.\xe2\x80\x9d  The defendants-petitioners are therefore sheltered by qualified immunity.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s account of the undisputed facts goes beyond those re-cited by the Court of Appeals.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that there was no probable cause to arrest the partygoers, and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity.  We reverse on both grounds.</p><p>I</p><p>Around 1 a.m. on March 16, 2008, the District\xe2\x80\x99s Metropolitan Police Department received a complaint about loud music and illegal activities at a house in Northeast D.\xc2\xa0C.  The caller, a former neighborhood commissioner, told police that the house had been vacant for several months.  When officers arrived at the scene, several neighbors confirmed that the house should have been empty.  The officers approached the house and, consistent with the complaint, heard loud music playing inside.</p><p>After the officers knocked on the front door, they saw a man look out the window and then run upstairs.  One of the partygoers opened the door, and the officers entered.  They immediately observed that the inside of the house \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98was in disarray\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and looked like \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a vacant property.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  841 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 20, 31 (DC 2012) (quoting Defs. Exh. A).  The officers smelled marijuana and saw beer bottles and cups of liquor on the floor.  In fact, the floor was so dirty that one of the partygoers refused to sit on it while being questioned.  Although the house had working electricity and plumbing, it had no furniture downstairs other than a few padded metal chairs.  The only other signs of habitation were blinds on the windows, food in the refrigerator, and toiletries in the bathroom.</p><p>In the living room, the officers found a makeshift strip club.  Several women were wearing only bras and thongs, with cash tucked into their garter belts.  The women were giving lap dances while other partygoers watched.  Most of the onlookers were holding cash and cups of alcohol.  After seeing the uniformed officers, many partygoers scattered into other parts of the house.</p><p>The officers found more debauchery upstairs.  A naked woman and several men were in the bedroom.  A bare mattress\xe2\x80\x94the only one in the house\xe2\x80\x94was on the floor, along with some lit candles and multiple open condom wrappers.  A used condom was on the windowsill.  The officers found one partygoer hiding in an upstairs closet, and another who had shut himself in the bathroom and refused to come out.</p><p>The officers found a total of 21 people in the house.  After interviewing all 21, the officers did not get a clear or consistent story.  Many partygoers said they were there for a bachelor party, but no one could identify the bachelor.  Each of the partygoers claimed that someone had invited them to the house, but no one could say who.  Two of the women working the party said that a woman named \xe2\x80\x9cPeaches\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cTasty\xe2\x80\x9d was renting the house and had given them permission to be there.  One of the women explained that the previous owner had recently passed away, and Peaches had just started renting the house from the grandson who inherited it.  But the house had no boxes or moving supplies.  She did not know Peaches\xe2\x80\x99 real name.  And Peaches was not there.</p><p>An officer asked<b> </b>the woman to call Peaches on her phone so he could talk to her.  Peaches answered and explained that she had just left the party to go to the store.  When the officer asked her to return, Peaches refused because she was afraid of being arrested.  The sergeant supervising the investigation also spoke with Peaches.  At first, Peaches claimed to be renting the house from the owner, who was fixing it up for her.  She also said that she had given the attendees permission to have the party.  When the sergeant again asked her who had given her permission to use the house, Peaches became evasive and hung up.  The sergeant called her back, and she began yelling and insisting that she had permission before hanging up a second time.  The officers eventually got Peaches on the phone again, and she admitted that she did not have permission to use the house.</p><p>The officers then contacted the owner.  He told them that he had been trying to negotiate a lease with Peaches, but they had not reached an agreement.  He confirmed that he had not given Peaches (or anyone else) permission to be in the house\xe2\x80\x94let alone permission to use it for a bachelor party.  At that point, the officers arrested the 21 partygoers for unlawful entry.  See D.\xc2\xa0C. Code \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x933302 (2008).  The police transported the partygoers to the police station, where the lieutenant decided to charge them with disorderly conduct.  See \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x931321.  The partygoers were released, and the charges were eventually dropped.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>II</p><p>Respondents, 16 of the 21 partygoers, sued the District and five of the arresting officers.  They sued the officers for false arrest under the Fourth Amendment, Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979,42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, and under District law.  They sued the District for false arrest and negligent supervision under District law.

And in its view, the officers had no such evidence.  <i>Id.,</i> at 32\xe2\x80\x9333, 37\xe2\x80\x9338.</p><p>With liability resolved, the case proceeded to trial on damages.  The jury awarded the partygoers a total of $680,000 in compensatory damages.  After the District Court awarded attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, the total award was nearly $1 million.</p><p>On appeal, a divided panel of the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  On the question of probable cause, the panel majority made Peaches\xe2\x80\x99 invitation \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d to its determination that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest the party- goers for unlawful entry.  765 F.\xc2\xa03d 13, 21 (2014).  The panel majority asserted that, \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of any conflicting information, Peaches\xe2\x80\x99 invitation vitiates the necessary element of [the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99] intent to enter against the will of the lawful owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And the panel major- ity determined that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is simply no evidence in the record that [the partygoers] had any reason to think the invitation was invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>On the question of qualified immunity, the panel majority determined that it was \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly clear\xe2\x80\x9d that a person with \xe2\x80\x9ca good purpose and bona fide belief of her right to enter\xe2\x80\x9d lacks the necessary intent for unlawful entry.  <i>Id.</i>, at 27.  In other words, the officers needed \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the partygoers \xe2\x80\x9cknew or should have known they were entering against the will of the lawful owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And here, the panel majority asserted, the officers must \xe2\x80\x9chave known that uncontroverted evidence of an invitation to enter the premises would vitiate probable cause for unlawful entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Judge Brown dissented.  She concluded that summary judgment on the false-arrest claims was improper because, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer \xe2\x80\x9ccould disbelieve [the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99] claim of innocent entry\xe2\x80\x9d and infer that they knew or should have known that they did not have permission to be in the house.  <i>Id.</i>, at 34. She also disagreed with the denial of qualified immunity, contending that a reasonable officer could have found probable cause to arrest in this \xe2\x80\x9cunusual factual scenario, not well represented in the controlling case law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 36.</p><p>The D.\xc2\xa0C.

See <i>Payton </i>v. <i>New York</i>,445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573,585 (1980).  A warrantless arrest is reasonable if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect committed a crime in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  <i>Atwater </i>v. <i>Lago Vista</i>,532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 318,354 (2001).</p><p>To determine whether an officer had probable cause for an arrest, \xe2\x80\x9cwe examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \xe2\x80\x98whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\xe2\x80\x99 probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maryland </i>v. <i>Pringle</i>,540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 366,371 (2003) (quoting <i>Ornelas </i>v. <i>United States</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 690,696 (1996)).  Because probable cause \xe2\x80\x9cdeals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 371, it is \xe2\x80\x9ca fluid concept\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cnot readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Illinois </i>v. <i>Gates</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213,232 (1983).

Nonetheless, the partygoers contend that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest them because the officers had no reason to believe that they \xe2\x80\x9cknew or should have known\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9centry was unwanted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ortberg </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 81 A.\xc2\xa03d 303, 308 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 2013).  We disagree.  Considering the totality of the circumstances, the officers made an \xe2\x80\x9centirely reason- able inference\xe2\x80\x9d that the partygoers were knowingly taking advantage of a vacant house as a venue for their late-night party.  <i>Pringle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 372.</p><p>Consider first the condition of the house.  Multiple neighbors, including a former neighborhood official, informed the officers that the house had been vacant for several months.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  The house had no furniture, except for a few padded metal chairs and a bare mattress.  The rest of the house was empty, save for some fixtures and large appliances.  The house had a few signs of inhabitance\xe2\x80\x94working electricity and plumbing, blinds on the windows, toiletries in the bathroom, and food in the refrigerator.  But those facts are not necessarily inconsistent with the house being unoccupied.  The owner could have paid the utilities and kept the blinds while he looked for a new tenant, and the partygoers could have brought the food and toiletries.  Although one woman told the officers that Peaches had recently moved in, the officers had reason to doubt that was true.  There were no boxes or other moving supplies in the house; nor were there other possessions, such as clothes in the closet, suggesting someone lived there.</p><p>In addition to the condition of the house, consider the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  The party was still going strong when the officers arrived after 1 a.m., with music so loud that it could be heard from outside.  Upon entering the house, multiple officers smelled marijuana.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  The party- goers left beer bottles and cups of liquor on the floor, and they left the floor so dirty that one of them refused to sit on it.  The living room had been converted into a makeshift strip club.  Strippers in bras and thongs, with cash stuffed in their garter belts, were giving lap dances.  Upstairs, the officers found a group of men with a single, naked woman on a bare mattress\xe2\x80\x94the only bed in the house\xe2\x80\x94along with multiple open condom wrappers and a used condom.</p><p>Taken together, the condition of the house and the conduct of the partygoers allowed the officers to make several \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common-sense conclusions about human behavior.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gates</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 231 (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Cortez</i>,449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 411,418 (1981)).<i> </i>Most homeowners do not live in near-barren houses.  And most homeowners do not invite people over to use their living room as a strip club, to have sex in their bedroom, to smoke marijuana inside, and to leave their floors filthy.  The officers could thus infer that the partygoers knew their party was not authorized.</p><p>The partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to the officers gave them further reason to believe that the partygoers knew they lacked permission to be in the house.  Many scattered at the sight of the uniformed officers.  Two hid themselves, one in a closet and the other in a bathroom.  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]nprovoked flight upon noticing the police,\xe2\x80\x9d we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis certainly suggestive\xe2\x80\x9d of wrongdoing and can be treated as \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious behavior\xe2\x80\x9d that factors into the totality of the circumstances.  <i>Illinois </i>v. <i>Wardlow</i>,528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 119\xe2\x80\x93125 (2000).  In fact, \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately furtive actions and flight at the approach of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. law officers are <i>strong</i> indicia of <i>mens rea.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sibron </i>v. <i>New York</i>,392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40,66 (1968) (emphasis added).  A reasonable officer could infer that the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 scattering and hiding was an indication that they knew they were not supposed to be there.</p><p>The partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 answers to the officers\xe2\x80\x99 questions also suggested their guilty state of mind.  When the officers asked who had given them permission to be there, the partygoers gave vague and implausible responses.  They could not say who had invited them.  Only two people claimed that Peaches had invited them, and they were working the party instead of attending it.  If Peaches was the hostess, it was odd that none of the partygoers mentioned her name.  Additionally, some of the partygoers claimed the event was a bachelor party, but no one could identify the bachelor.  The officers could have disbelieved them, since people normally do not throw a bachelor party without a bachelor.  Based on the vagueness and implausibility of the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 stories, the officers could have reasonably inferred that they were lying and that their lies suggested a guilty mind.  Cf. <i>Devenpeck </i>v. <i>Alford</i>,543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 146\xe2\x80\x93156 (2004) (noting that the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cuntruthful and evasive\xe2\x80\x9d answers to police questioning could support probable cause).</p><p>The panel majority relied heavily on the fact that Peaches said she had invited the partygoers to the house.  But when the officers spoke with Peaches, she was nervous, agitated, and evasive.  Cf. <i>Wardlow</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 124 (explaining that the police can take a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnervous, evasive behavior\xe2\x80\x9d into account).  After initially insisting that she had permission to use the house, she ultimately confessed that this was a lie\xe2\x80\x94a fact that the owner confirmed.  Peaches\xe2\x80\x99 lying and evasive behavior gave the officers reason to discredit everything she had told them.  For example, the officers could have inferred that Peaches lied to them when she said she had invited the others to the house, which was consistent with the fact that hardly anyone at the party knew her name.  Or the officers could have inferred that Peaches told the partygoers (like she eventually told the police) that she was not actually renting the house, which was consistent with how the party- goers were treating it.</p><p>Viewing these circumstances as a whole, a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe the partygoers knew they did not have permission to be in the house.</p><p>B</p><p>In concluding otherwise, the panel majority engaged in an \xe2\x80\x9cexcessively technical dissection\xe2\x80\x9d of the factors supporting probable cause.  <i>Gates</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234.  Indeed, the panel majority failed to follow two basic and well-established principles of law.</p><p>First, the panel majority viewed each fact \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pringle</i>, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 372, n.\xc2\xa02.  This was \xe2\x80\x9cmistaken in light of our precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The \xe2\x80\x9ctotality of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d requires courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole picture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cortez</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 417.  Our precedents recognize that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts\xe2\x80\x94especially when the parts are viewed in isolation.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Arvizu</i>,534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266\xe2\x80\x93278 (2002).  Instead of considering the facts as a whole, the panel majority took them one by one.  For example, it dismissed the fact that the partygoers \xe2\x80\x9cscattered or hid when the police entered the house\xe2\x80\x9d because that fact was \xe2\x80\x9cnot sufficient <i>standing alone</i> to create probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  765 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 23 (emphasis added).  Similarly, it found \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the record suggesting that the condition of the house, <i>on its own</i>, should have alerted the [partygoers] that they were unwelcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  The totality-of-the-circumstances test \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes this sort of divide-and-conquer analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arvizu</i>, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 274.</p><p>Second, the panel majority mistakenly believed that it could dismiss outright any circumstances that were \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of innocent explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 277.  For example, the panel majority brushed aside the drinking and the lap dances as \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 explanation that they were having a bachelor party.  765 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 23.  And it similarly dismissed the condition of the house as \xe2\x80\x9centirely consistent with\xe2\x80\x9d Peaches being a \xe2\x80\x9cnew tenant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But probable cause does not require officers to rule out a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s innocent explanation for suspicious facts.  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \xe2\x80\x98innocent\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98guilty,\xe2\x80\x99 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gates</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 244, n.\xc2\xa013.  Thus, the panel majority should have asked whether a reasonable officer could conclude\xe2\x80\x94considering all of the surrounding circumstances, including the plausibility of the explanation itself\xe2\x80\x94that there was a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial chance of criminal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The circumstances here certainly suggested criminal activity.  As explained, the officers found a group of people who claimed to be having a bachelor party with no bachelor, in a near-empty house, with strippers in the living room and sexual activity in the bedroom, and who fled at the first sign of police.  The panel majority identified innocent explanations for most of these circumstances in isolation, but again, this kind of divide-and-conquer approach is improper.  A factor viewed in isolation is often more \xe2\x80\x9creadily susceptible to an innocent explanation\xe2\x80\x9d than one viewed as part of a totality.  <i>Arvizu</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 274.  And here, the totality of the circumstances gave the officers plenty of reasons to doubt the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 protestations of innocence.</p><p>For all of these reasons, we reverse the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest. Accordingly, the District and its officers are entitled to summary judgment on all of the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 claims.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>IV</p><p>Our conclusion that the officers had probable cause to arrest the partygoers is sufficient to resolve this case.  But where, as here, the Court of Appeals erred on both the merits of the constitutional claim and the question of qualified immunity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have discretion to correct its errors at each step.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ashcroft </i>v. <i>al-Kidd</i>,563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 731,735 (2011); see, <i>e.g., Plumhoff </i>v. <i>Rickard</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  We exercise that discretion here because the D.\xc2\xa0C.

Tellingly, neither the panel majority nor the party- goers have identified a single precedent\xe2\x80\x94much less a controlling case or robust consensus of cases\xe2\x80\x94finding a Fourth Amendment violation \xe2\x80\x9cunder similar circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pauly</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 6).

The officers were thus entitled to qualified immunity.</p><p>B</p><p>The panel majority did not follow this straightforward analysis.  It instead reasoned that, under clearly established District law, a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood purpose and bona fide belief of her right to enter\xe2\x80\x9d vitiates probable cause to arrest her for unlawful entry.  765 F.\xc2\xa03d<i>,</i> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The panel majority then concluded\xe2\x80\x94in a two-sentence paragraph without any explanation\xe2\x80\x94that the officers must have known that \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroverted evidence of an invitation to enter the premises would vitiate probable cause for unlawful entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 27.  By treating the invitation as \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroverted evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel majority assumed that the officers could not infer the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 intent from other circumstances.  And by treating the invitation as if it automatically vitiated probable cause, the panel majority assumed that the officers could not disbelieve the party- goers\xe2\x80\x99 story.</p><p>The rule applied by the panel majority was not clearly established because it was not \xe2\x80\x9csettled law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hunter</i>, 502 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228.  The panel majority relied on a single decision, <i>Smith </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 281 A.\xc2\xa02d 438 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 1971).[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  The defendant in <i>Smith</i>, who was found trespassing in a locked construction site near midnight, asserted that he was entitled to a jury instruction explaining that a bona fide belief of a right to enter is a complete defense to unlawful entry.  <i>Id.,</i> at 439\xe2\x80\x93440.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to give the instruction because the defendant had not established a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable basis\xe2\x80\x9d for his alleged bona fide belief.  <i>Ibid.  Smith </i>does not say anything about whether the officers here could infer from all the evidence that the partygoers knew that they were trespassing.  </p><p>Nor would it have been clear to every reasonable officer that, in these circumstances, the partygoers\xe2\x80\x99 bona fide belief that they were invited to the house was \xe2\x80\x9cuncontroverted.\xe2\x80\x9d  The officers knew that the partygoers had entered the home against the will of the owner.  And District case law suggested that officers can infer a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s guilty state of mind based solely on his conduct.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]  In <i>Tillman </i>v. <i>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</i>, 695 A.\xc2\xa02d 94 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 1997), for example, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals held that officers had probable cause to believe the plaintiff knowingly entered the paid area of a subway station without paying.  <i>Id.,</i> at 96.  The court rejected the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers had no reason to believe that [the suspect] was \xe2\x80\x98knowingly\xe2\x80\x99 in the paid area\xe2\x80\x9d because the officers \xe2\x80\x9creasonably could have inferred from [the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s] undisputed conduct that he had the intent required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The court emphasized that officers can rely on \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary and reasonable inference that people know what they are doing when they act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The court also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be an unusual case where the circumstances, while undoubtedly proving an unlawful act, nonetheless demonstrated so clearly that the suspect lacked the required intent that the police would not even have probable cause for an arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And the fact that a case is unusual, we have held, is \xe2\x80\x9can important indication .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that [the officer\xe2\x80\x99s] conduct did not violate a \xe2\x80\x98clearly established\xe2\x80\x99 right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pauly</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).</p><p>Moreover, existing precedent would have given the officers reason to doubt that they had to accept the party- goers\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of a bona fide belief.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals has held that officers are not required to take a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s innocent explanation at face value.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Nichols </i>v. <i>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc.</i>, 322 A.\xc2\xa02d 283, 286 (1974) (holding that an officer was not \xe2\x80\x9cobliged to believe the explanation of a suspected shoplifter\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similar precedent exists in the Federal Courts of Appeals, which have recognized that officers are free to disregard either all innocent explanations,[<a href="#F10">10</a>] or at least innocent explanations that are inherently or circumstantially implausible.[<a href="#F11">11</a>]  These cases suggest that innocent explanations\xe2\x80\x94 even uncontradicted ones\xe2\x80\x94do not have any automatic, probable-cause-vitiating effect.</p><p>For these reasons, a reasonable officer, looking at the entire legal landscape at the time of the arrests, could have interpreted the law as permitting the arrests here.  There was no controlling case holding that a bona fide belief of a right to enter defeats probable cause, that officers cannot infer a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s guilty state of mind based on his conduct alone, or that officers must accept a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s innocent explanation at face value.  Indeed, several precedents suggested the opposite.  The officers were thus entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>The judgment of the D.\xc2\xa0C.
