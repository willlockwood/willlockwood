S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa763(d), but only to the extent the deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income, \xc2\xa767(a).  A trust may also take such deductions subject to the 2% floor, \xc2\xa767(e)<em>,</em> except that when the relevant cost is \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or incurred in connection with the administration of the \xe2\x80\xa6 trust\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust,\xe2\x80\x9d the cost may be deducted without regard to the floor, \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  After petitioner Knight (Trustee), the trustee of a testamentary trust (Trust), hired the Warfield firm to advise as to Trust investments, the Trust deducted in full on its fiduciary income tax return the investment advisory fees paid to Warfield.  Respondent Commissioner found the fees subject to the 2% floor and therefore allowed the deduction only to the extent the fees exceeded 2% of the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s adjusted gross income.  The Tax Court decided for the Commissioner, and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that because such fees were costs of a type that <em>could</em> be incurred if the property were held individually rather than in trust, their deduction by the Trust was subject to the 2% floor.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Investment advisory fees generally are subject to the 2% floor when incurred by a trust.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In asking whether a particular type of cost incurred by a trust \xe2\x80\x9cwould <em>not</em> have been incurred\xe2\x80\x9d if the property were held by an individual, \xc2\xa767(e)(1) excepts from the 2% floor only those costs that it would be uncommon (or unusual, or unlikely) for such a hypothetical individual to incur.  The question whether a trust-related expense is fully deductible turns on a prediction about what would happen if a fact were changed\xe2\x80\x94specifically, if the property were held by an individual rather than by a trust.  Predictions are based on what would customarily or commonly occur.  Thus, in the context of making such a prediction, when there is uncertainty about the answer, the word \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d is best read to express concepts such as custom, habit, natural disposition, or probability.  Although the statutory text does not expressly ask whether expenses are \xe2\x80\x9ccustomarily\xe2\x80\x9d incurred outside of trusts, that is the direct import of the language in context.  The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which asks whether the cost at issue <em>could </em>have been incurred by an individual, flies in the face of the statutory language.  Had Congress intended the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading, it easily could have replaced \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ccould\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa767(e)(1), and presumably would have.  The Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the proper inquiry is whether a particular expense of a particular trust was caused by the fact that the property was held in trust fails because the statute by its terms does not establish a straightforward causation test, but instead looks to the counterfactual question whether an <em>individual</em> would have incurred such costs in the <em>absence </em>of a trust.  Further, under the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s approach, <em>every </em>trust-related expense would be fully deductible, thus allowing the exception to the 2% floor in \xc2\xa767(e)(1) to swallow the general rule.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Trust\xe2\x80\x99s investment advisory fees are subject to the 2% floor.  The Trustee\xe2\x80\x94who has the burden of establishing entitlement to the deduction, see, <em>e.g., INDOPCO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/79/index.html">503 U. S. 79</a>, 84\xe2\x80\x94has not demonstrated that it is uncommon or unusual for individuals to hire an investment adviser.  His argument is that individuals cannot incur trust investment advisory fees, not that individuals do not commonly incur investment advisory fees.  Indeed, his essential point is that he engaged an investment adviser because of his fiduciary duties under Connecticut law, which requires a trustee to invest and manage trust assets \xe2\x80\x9cas a prudent investor would<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>This prudent investor standard plainly does not refer to a prudent <em>trustee, </em>but looks instead to what a prudent investor with the same investment objectives handling his own affairs would do\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a prudent individual investor.  Because a hypothetical prudent investor in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s position would reasonably have solicited investment advice, it is quite difficult to say that the investment advisory fees \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been incurred\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> that it would be unusual or uncommon for such fees to have been incurred\xe2\x80\x94if the property were held by an individual investor with the same objectives as the Trust in handling his own affairs.  While Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to phrase the pertinent inquiry in terms of a prediction about a hypothetical situation inevitably entails some uncertainty, that is no excuse for judicial amendment of the statute.  The Code elsewhere poses similar questions, see, <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7162(a), 212, and the inquiry is in any event what \xc2\xa767(e)(1) requires.  Although some trust-related investment advisory fees may be fully deductible if an investment adviser were to impose a special, additional charge applicable only to its fiduciary accounts, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Warfield did so, or treated the Trust any differently than it would have treated an individual with similar objectives, because of the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations.  Nor does the Trust assert that its investment objectives or balancing of competing interests were so distinctive that any comparison with those of an individual investor would be improper.

A trust may also claim those deductions, also subject to the 2% floor, except that costs incurred in the administration of the trust, which would not have been incurred if the trust property were not held by a trust, may be deducted without regard to the floor.  In the case of individuals, investment advisory fees are subject to the 2% floor; the question presented is whether such fees are also subject to the floor when incurred by a trust.  We hold that they are and therefore affirm the judgment below, albeit for different reasons than those given by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the \xe2\x80\x9ctaxable income\xe2\x80\x9d of both individuals and trusts.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71(a).  The Code instructs that the calculation of taxable income begins with a determination of \xe2\x80\x9cgross income,\xe2\x80\x9d capaciously defined as \xe2\x80\x9call income from whatever source derived.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa761(a).  \xe2\x80\x9cAdjusted gross income\xe2\x80\x9d is then calculated by subtracting from gross income certain \xe2\x80\x9cabove-the-line\xe2\x80\x9d deductions, such as trade and business expenses and losses from the sale or exchange of property.  \xc2\xa762(a).  Finally, taxable income is calculated by subtracting from adjusted gross income \xe2\x80\x9citemized deductions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbelow-the-line\xe2\x80\x9d deductions\xe2\x80\x94defined as all allowable deductions other than the \xe2\x80\x9cabove-the-line\xe2\x80\x9d deductions identified in \xc2\xa762(a) and the deduction for personal exemptions allowed under \xc2\xa7151 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  \xc2\xa763(d) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 2085, below-the-line deductions were deductible in full.  This system resulted in significant complexity and potential for abuse, requiring \xe2\x80\x9cextensive [taxpayer] recordkeeping with regard to what commonly are small expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9csignificant administrative and enforcement problems for the Internal Revenue Service.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93426, p. 109 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, Congress enacted what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9c2% floor\xe2\x80\x9d by adding \xc2\xa767 to the Code.  Section 67(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe miscellaneous itemized deductions for any taxable year shall be allowed only to the extent that the aggregate of such deductions exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term \xe2\x80\x9cmiscellaneous itemized deductions\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to include all itemized deductions other than certain ones specified in \xc2\xa767(b).  Investment advisory fees are deductible pursuant to 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7212.  Because \xc2\xa7212 is not listed in \xc2\xa767(b) as one of the categories of expenses that may be deducted in full, such fees are \xe2\x80\x9cmiscellaneous itemized deductions\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the 2% floor.  26 CFR \xc2\xa71.67\xe2\x80\x931T(a)(1)(ii) (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 67(e) makes the 2% floor generally applicable not only to individuals but also to estates and trusts,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] with one exception relevant here.  Under this exception, \xe2\x80\x9cthe adjusted gross income of an estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual, except that \xe2\x80\xa6 the deductions for costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be treated as allowable\xe2\x80\x9d and not subject to the 2% floor.  \xc2\xa767(e)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Michael J. Knight is the trustee of the William L. Rudkin Testamentary Trust, established in the State of Connecticut in 1967.  In 2000, the Trustee hired Warfield Associates, Inc., to provide advice with respect to investing the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  At the beginning of the tax year, the Trust held approximately $2.9 million in marketable securities, and it paid Warfield $22,241 in investment advisory fees for the year.  On its fiduciary income tax return for 2000, the Trust reported total income of $624,816, and it deducted in full the investment advisory fees paid to Warfield.  After conducting an audit, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that these investment advisory fees were miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor.  The Commissioner therefore allowed the Trust to deduct the investment advisory fees, which were the only claimed deductions subject to the floor, only to the extent that they exceeded 2% of the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s adjusted gross income.  The discrepancy resulted in a tax deficiency of $4,448.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Trust filed a petition in the United States Tax Court seeking review of the assessed deficiency.  It argued that the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty to act as a \xe2\x80\x9cprudent investor\xe2\x80\x9d under the Connecticut Uniform Prudent Investor Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa745a\xe2\x80\x93541a to 45a\xe2\x80\x93541<em>l</em> (2007),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] required the Trustee to obtain investment advisory services, and therefore to pay investment advisory fees.  The Trust argued that such fees are accordingly unique to trusts and therefore fully deductible under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  The Tax Court rejected this argument, holding that \xc2\xa767(e)(1) allows full deductibility only for expenses that are not commonly incurred outside the trust setting.  Because investment advisory fees are commonly incurred by individuals, the Tax Court held that they are subject to the 2% floor when incurred by a trust.  <em>Rudkin Testamentary Trust</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 124 T.\xc2\xa0C. 304, 309\xe2\x80\x93311 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Trust appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, in determining whether costs such as investment advisory fees are fully deductible or subject to the 2% floor, \xc2\xa767(e) \xe2\x80\x9cdirects the inquiry toward the counterfactual condition of assets held individually instead of in trust,\xe2\x80\x9d and requires \xe2\x80\x9can objective determination of whether the particular cost is one that is peculiar to trusts and one that individuals are incapable of incurring.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 F.\xc2\xa03d 149, 155, 156 (2006).  The court held that because investment advisory fees were \xe2\x80\x9ccosts of a type that <em>could</em> be incurred if the property were held individually rather than in trust,\xe2\x80\x9d deduction of such fees by the Trust was subject to the 2% floor.  <em>Id.</em>, at 155\xe2\x80\x93156.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals are divided on the question presented.  The Sixth Circuit has held that investment advisory fees are fully deductible.  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neill</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 994 F.\xc2\xa02d 302, 304 (1993).  In contrast, both the Fourth and Federal Circuits have held that such fees are subject to the 2% floor, because they are \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccustomarily\xe2\x80\x9d incurred outside of trusts.  See <em>Scott</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 328 F.\xc2\xa03d 132, 140 (CA4 2003); <em>Mellon Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 265 F.\xc2\xa03d 1275, 1281 (CA Fed. 2001).  The Court of Appeals below came to the same conclusion, but as noted announced a more exacting test, allowing \xe2\x80\x9cfull deduction only for those costs that <em>could not</em> have been incurred by an individual property owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 156 (emphasis added).  We granted the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to resolve the conflict, 551 U. S. __ (2007), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe start, as always, with the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html">529 U. S. 420</a>, 431 (2000).  Section 67(e) sets forth a general rule: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he adjusted gross income of [a] \xe2\x80\xa6 trust shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is, trusts can ordinarily deduct costs subject to the same 2% floor that applies to individuals\xe2\x80\x99 deductions.  Section 67(e) provides for an exception to the 2% floor when two conditions are met.  First, the relevant cost must be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or incurred in connection with the administration of the \xe2\x80\xa6 trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  Second, the cost must be one \xe2\x80\x9cwhich would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying the statute, the Court of Appeals below asked whether the cost at issue <em>could</em> have been incurred by an individual.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This approach flies in the face of the statutory language.  The provision at issue asks whether the costs \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been incurred if the property were not held\xe2\x80\x9d in trust, <em>ibid.</em>, not, as the Court of Appeals would have it, whether the costs \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have been incurred\xe2\x80\x9d in such a case, 467 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 156.  The fact that an individual could not do something is one reason he would not, but not the only possible reason.  If Congress had intended the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading, it easily could have replaced \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute with \xe2\x80\x9ccould,\xe2\x80\x9d and presumably would have.  The fact that it did not adopt this readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports rejecting the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, if the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading were correct, it is not clear why Congress would have included in the statute the first clause of \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  If the only costs that are fully deductible are those that <em>could</em> not be incurred outside the trust context\xe2\x80\x94that is, that could <em>only</em> be incurred by trusts\xe2\x80\x94then there would be no reason to place the further condition on full deductibility that the costs be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or incurred in connection with the administration of the \xe2\x80\xa6 trust,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  We can think of no expense that could be incurred exclusively by a trust but would nevertheless <em>not</em> be \xe2\x80\x9cpaid or incurred in connection with\xe2\x80\x9d its administration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Trustee argues that the exception in \xc2\xa767(e)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes a straightforward causation test.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 22.  The proper inquiry, the Trustee contends, is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a particular expense of a particular trust or estate was caused by the fact that the property was held in the trust or estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Investment advisory fees incurred by a trust, the argument goes, meet this test because these costs are caused by the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s obligation \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain advice on investing trust assets in compliance with the Trustees\xe2\x80\x99 particular fiduciary duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We reject this reading as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s view, the statute operates only to distinguish costs that are incurred by virtue of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duties from those that are not.  But all (or nearly all) of a trust\xe2\x80\x99s expenses are incurred because the trustee has a duty to incur them; otherwise, there would be no reason for the trust to incur the expense in the first place.  See G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \xc2\xa7801, p. 134 (2d rev. ed. 1981) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he payment for expenses must be reasonably necessary to facilitate administration of the trust\xe2\x80\x9d).  As an example of a type of trust-related expense that would be subject to the 2% floor, the Trustee offers \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses for routine maintenance of real property\xe2\x80\x9d held by a trust.  Brief for Petitioner 23.  But such costs would appear to be fully deductible under the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s own reading, because a trustee is obligated to incur maintenance expenses in light of the fiduciary duty to maintain trust property.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7176, p. 381 (1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to use reasonable care and skill to preserve the trust property\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of its argument is circular: \xe2\x80\x9cTrust investment advice fees are caused by the fact the property is held in trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 19.  But \xe2\x80\x9ctrust investment advice fees\xe2\x80\x9d are only aptly described as such because the property is held in trust; the statute asks whether such costs would be incurred by an individual if the property were not.  Even when there is a clearly analogous category of costs that would be incurred by individuals, the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s reading would exempt most or all trust costs as fully deductible merely because they derive from a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty.  Adding the modifier \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d to costs that otherwise would be incurred by an individual surely cannot be enough to escape the 2% floor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, if the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s position were correct, then only the first clause of \xc2\xa767(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x94providing that the cost be \xe2\x80\x9cincurred in connection with the administration of the \xe2\x80\xa6 trust\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would be necessary.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s second, limiting condition\xe2\x80\x94that the cost also be one \xe2\x80\x9cwhich would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would do no work; we see no difference in saying, on the one hand, that costs are \xe2\x80\x9ccaused by\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that the property is held in trust and, on the other, that costs are incurred \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the administration\xe2\x80\x9d of the trust.  Thus, accepting the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s approach \xe2\x80\x9cwould render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U. S. 157</a>, 166 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s reading is further undermined by our inclination, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n construing provisions \xe2\x80\xa6 in which a general statement of policy is qualified by an exception, [to] read the exception narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Commissioner</em> v. <em>Clark</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/726/index.html">489 U.

As we have said, \xc2\xa767(e) sets forth a general rule for purposes of the 2% floor established in \xc2\xa767(a): \xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of this section, the adjusted gross income of an estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s reading, \xc2\xa767(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exception would swallow the general rule; most (if not all) expenses incurred by a trust would be fully deductible.  \xe2\x80\x9cGiven that Congress has enacted a general rule \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, we should not eviscerate that legislative judgment through an expansive reading of a somewhat ambiguous exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More to the point, the statute by its terms does not \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] a straightforward causation test,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 22, but rather invites a hypothetical inquiry into the treatment of the property were it held outside a trust.  The statute does not ask whether a cost was incurred <em>because </em>the property is held by a trust; it asks whether a particular cost \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa767(e)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cFar from examining the nature of the cost at issue from the perspective of whether it was caused by the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duties, the statute instead looks to the counterfactual question of whether <em>individuals</em> would have incurred such costs in the <em>absence </em>of a trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This brings us to the test adopted by the Fourth and Federal Circuits: Costs incurred by trusts that escape the 2% floor are those that would not \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccustomarily\xe2\x80\x9d be incurred by individuals.  See <em>Scott</em>, 328 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 140 (\xe2\x80\x9cPut simply, trust-related administrative expenses are subject to the 2% floor if they constitute expenses commonly incurred by individual taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Mellon Bank</em>, 265 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1281 (\xc2\xa767(e) \xe2\x80\x9ctreats as fully deductible only those trust-related administrative expenses that are unique to the administration of a trust and not customarily incurred outside of trusts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Solicitor General also accepts this view as an alternative reading of the statute.  See Brief for Respondent 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  We agree with this approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether a trust-related expense is fully deductible turns on a prediction about what would happen if a fact were changed\xe2\x80\x94specifically, if the property were held by an individual rather than by a trust.  In the context of making such a prediction, when there is uncertainty about the answer, the word \xe2\x80\x9cwould\xe2\x80\x9d is best read as \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ing] concepts such as custom, habit, natural disposition, or probability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 139.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2637\xe2\x80\x932638 (1993); American Heritage Dictionary 2042, 2059 (3d ed. 1996).  The Trustee objects that the statutory text \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not ask whether expenses are \xe2\x80\x98customarily\xe2\x80\x99 incurred outside of trusts,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, but that is the direct import of the language in context.  The text requires determining what would happen if a fact were changed; such an exercise necessarily entails a prediction; and predictions are based on what would customarily or commonly occur.  Thus, in asking whether a particular type of cost \xe2\x80\x9cwould <em>not</em> have been incurred\xe2\x80\x9d if the property were held by an individual, \xc2\xa767(e)(1) excepts from the 2% floor only those costs that it would be <em>un</em>common (or unusual, or unlikely) for such a hypothetical individual to incur.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having decided on the proper reading of \xc2\xa767(e)(1), we come to the application of the statute to the particular question in this case: whether investment advisory fees incurred by a trust escape the 2% floor.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not uncommon or unusual for individuals to hire an investment adviser.  Certainly the Trustee, who has the burden of establishing its entitlement to the deduction, has not demonstrated that it is.  See <em>INDOPCO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/79/index.html">503 U. S. 79</a>, 84 (1992) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98familiar rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0that \xe2\x80\x98an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace and that the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Interstate Transit Lines</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/590/index.html">319 U. S. 590</a>, 593 (1943))); Tax Court Rule 142(a)(1) (stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of proof shall be upon the petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d with certain exceptions not relevant here).  The Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that individuals cannot incur trust investment advisory fees, not that individuals do not commonly incur investment advisory fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the essential point of the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that he engaged an investment adviser because of his fiduciary duties under Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s Uniform Prudent Investor Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa745a\xe2\x80\x93541a(a) (2007).  The Act eponymously requires trustees to follow the \xe2\x80\x9cprudent investor rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  See n. 2, <em>supra</em>.  To satisfy this standard, a trustee must \xe2\x80\x9cinvest and manage trust assets <em>as a prudent investor would</em>, by considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements and other circumstances of the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa745a\xe2\x80\x93541b(a) (emphasis added).  The prudent investor standard plainly does not refer to a prudent <em>trustee</em>; it would not be very helpful to explain that a trustee should act as a prudent trustee would.  Rather, the standard looks to what a prudent investor with the same investment objectives handling his own affairs would do\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a prudent individual investor.  See Restatement (Third) of Trusts (Prudent Investor Rule) Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on \xc2\xa7227, p. 58 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe prudent investor rule of this Section has its origins in the dictum of Harvard College<em> </em>v.<em> </em>Amory, 9 Pick. (26 Mass.) 446, 461 (1830), stating that trustees must \xe2\x80\x98observe how men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Musser\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</em>, 341 Pa. 1, 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 17 A. 2d 411, 415 (1941) (noting the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca trustee must exercise such prudence and diligence in conducting the affairs of the trust as men of average diligence and discretion would employ in their own affairs\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we have no reason to doubt the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a hypothetical prudent investor in his position would have solicited investment advice, just as he did.  Having accepted all this, it is quite difficult to say that investment advisory fees \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have been incurred\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, that it would be unusual or uncommon for such fees to have been incurred\xe2\x80\x94if the property were held by an individual investor with the same objectives as the Trust in handling his own affairs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We appreciate that the inquiry into what is common may not be as easy in other cases, particularly given the absence of regulatory guidance.  But once you depart in the name of ease of administration from the language chosen by Congress, there is more than one way to skin the cat: The Trustee raises administrability concerns in support of his causation test, Reply Brief for Petitioner 6, but so does the Government in explaining why it prefers the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach to the one it has successfully advanced before the Tax Court and two Federal Circuits.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to phrase the pertinent inquiry in terms of a prediction about a hypothetical situation inevitably entails some uncertainty, but that is no excuse for judicial amendment of the statute.  The Code elsewhere poses similar questions\xe2\x80\x94such as whether expenses are \xe2\x80\x9cordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7162(a), 212; see also <em>Deputy, Administratrix</em> v. <em>Du Pont</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/488/index.html">308 U. S. 488</a>, 495 (1940) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]rdinary has the connotation of normal, usual, or customary\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94and the inquiry is in any event what \xc2\xa767(e)(1) requires.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Solicitor General concedes, some trust-related investment advisory fees may be fully deductible \xe2\x80\x9cif an investment advisor were to impose a special, additional charge applicable only to its fiduciary accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 25.  There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest that Warfield charged the Trustee anything extra, or treated the Trust any differently than it would have treated an individual with similar objectives, because of the Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations.  See App. 24\xe2\x80\x9327.  It is conceivable, moreover, that a trust may have an unusual investment objective, or may require a specialized balancing of the interests of various parties, such that a reasonable comparison with individual investors would be improper.  In such a case, the incremental cost of expert advice beyond what would normally be required for the ordinary taxpayer would not be subject to the 2% floor.  Here, however, the Trust has not asserted that its investment objective or its requisite balancing of competing interests was distinctive.  Accordingly, we conclude that the investment advisory fees incurred by the Trust are subject to the 2% floor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because this case is only about trusts, we generally refer to trusts throughout, but the analysis applies equally to estates.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Forty-four States and the District of Columbia have adopted versions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act.  See 7B U. L. A. 1\xe2\x80\x932 (2006) (listing States that have enacted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act).  Five of the remaining six States have adopted their own versions of the prudent investor standard.  See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 12, \xc2\xa73302 (1995 ed. and 2006 Supp.); Ga.

See Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9320, 22.  Indeed, after the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision, the Commissioner adopted that court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute in a proposed regulation.  See Section 67 Limitations on Estates or Trusts, 72 Fed. Reg. 41243, 41245 (2007) (notice of proposed rulemaking) (a trust-related cost is exempted from the 2% floor only if \xe2\x80\x9can individual <em>could not</em> have incurred that cost in connection with property not held in an estate or trust\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The Government did not advance this argument before the Court of Appeals.  See Brief for Appellee in No. 05\xe2\x80\x935151\xe2\x80\x93AG (CA2), pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934, 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  In fact, the notice of proposed rulemaking appears to be the first time the Government has ever taken this position, and we are the first Court to which the argument has been made in a brief.  See Brief for United States in <em>Mellon Bank</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 01\xe2\x80\x935015 (CA Fed.), p.\xc2\xa027 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a trust-related administrative expense is also customarily or habitually incurred outside of trusts, then it is subject to the two-percent floor\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States in <em>Scott</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 02\xe2\x80\x931464 (CA4), p.\xc2\xa027 (same).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In pressing the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach, the Solicitor General argues that \xe2\x80\x9cto say that a team would not have won the game if it were not for the quarterback\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding play is to say that the team could not have won without the quarterback.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 19.

The statute, in contrast, does not posit any proposition.  Rather, it asks a question: whether a particular cost <em>would</em> have been incurred if the property were held by an individual instead of a trust.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
