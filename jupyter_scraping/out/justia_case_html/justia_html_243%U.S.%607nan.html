JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Morehead was indicted under \xc2\xa7 37 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. 1096, chap. 321, Comp.Stat. 1913, \xc2\xa7 10,20] for conspiring with others to commit an offense against the United States.  The offense contemplated by the conspirators is subornation of perjury (Criminal Code, \xc2\xa7 126) in connection with soldiers\' declaratory statements, to be filed by defendant as agent, covering public lands under the Homestead Law.  The perjury set forth in the indictment consists in false swearing before notaries public and clerks of state courts to declaratory statements.  The parts of the statement alleged to be false are those which declare:</p>\n<p>(1) That the claim is made for his [the applicant\'s] exclusive use and benefit, for the purpose of actual settlement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="609">Page 243 U. S. 609</a></p><p> and cultivation, and not either directly or indirectly for the use or benefit of any other person.</p>\n<p>(2) That the agent has no right or interest, direct or indirect, in the filing of such declaratory statement.</p>\n<p>The district court sustained a demurrer on the ground that the indictment did not charge a crime, holding that there was no law which required affidavits to soldiers\' declaratory statements; that the Land Department was not authorized to exact them; that consequently no law "authorizes an oath to be administered" to such affidavits; and, as perjury is possible only when an oath is authorized to be administered, the procuring of these false oaths could not be subornation of perjury, nor an agreement to secure them a conspiracy to suborn perjury. The case comes here on writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act (March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246).</p>\n<p>The Homestead Law (Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2304-2309, embodying Act of June 8, 1872, c. 338, 17 Stat. 333) does not prescribe whether or not an affidavit shall accompany a soldier\'s declaratory statement.  The affidavit is prescribed by a regulation of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, promulgated with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It is clear that a charge of perjury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 243 U. S. 610</a></p><p> may be based upon a valid regulation of the General Land Office requiring an affidavit if the oath be taken "before a competent tribunal, officer, or person."  <em>United States v. Smull,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/236/405/case.html">236 U. S. 405</a></span>.  The question obviously arising here is whether the law authorized the oath to be administered.  Another question -- whether it was administered by a competent tribunal, officer, or person -- was treated by both parties as requiring decision.  Assuming without specially determining the occasion for passing upon the second question, we proceed to consider both.</p>\n<p>1. <em>Whether an affidavit may be required to a soldiers\' homestead declaratory statement.</em></p>\n<p>The Homestead Law [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] gives to every soldier who served </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 243 U. S. 611</a></p><p> in the Army of the United States during the War of the Rebellion for ninety days, was honorably discharged and remained loyal to the government, the right, upon certain conditions, to enter upon 160 acres of the public land as a homestead and receive a patent therefor.  To comply with these conditions, the applicant must make actual entry, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] settlement, and improvement, and he must, on applying to enter the land, make and file the affidavit, as provided in Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2290, that such application is honestly and in good faith made for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, and not for the benefit of any other person.  Furthermore, in order to obtain a certificate or patent, he must, under Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2291, make proof of his residence for the full period, and an affidavit "that no part of such land has been alienated."  The filing of a declaratory statement is not a necessary step in acquiring title to land.  It relates to a privilege, akin to preemption, by which he may secure, prior to the entry under \xc2\xa7 2290, a preferential right to acquire, under the homestead law, the particular tract located on.  The privilege is exercised by filing the declaratory statement with the register, and if exercised, lapses unless, within six months thereafter, the soldier makes entry and actually commences settlement and improvement.  <em>See</em> Charles Hotaling, 3 L.D. 17, 20; Stephens v. Rey, 5 L.D. 133, 134.  To render this privilege readily available to soldiers living at a distance, authority is given (Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2309,) [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] to "enter upon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 243 U. S. 612</a></p><p> the homestead by filing a declaratory statement," "as well by an agent as in person."  Thus, the soldier can be assured of the selection of an advantageous homestead before perfecting his plan for removing to his new home.</p>\n<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that this special privilege, granted to facilitate the acquisition by soldiers of homesteads in grateful recognition of patriotic service, was soon perverted into an instrument of fraud.  Soldiers\' declaratory statements, acquired by so-called agents in large numbers, became the subject of extensive speculation.  They were used as a means of preempting choice lands for a period of six months with a view merely to selling relinquishments of locations to persons desiring to acquire public lands under the preemption or general homestead laws.  (<em>See</em> 1 L.D. 79.)  To stay this abuse, the General Land Office issued, on December 15, 1882, the circular concerning "Soldiers\' Homestead Declaratory statements" (1 L.D. 648), [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] prescribing requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 243 U. S. 613</a></p><p> which have since remained in force and are embodied in substance in the regulation of October 11, 1910.</p>\n<p>Defendant contends that this regulation, which has been enforced continuously for nearly thirty-five years, is invalid.  Since the Land Department is expressly charged with the duty of enforcing the public land laws by appropriate regulations, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the regulation in question was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 243 U. S. 614</a></p><p> duly promulgated, the assertion of its invalidity must be predicated either upon its being inconsistent with the statutes or upon its being, in itself, unreasonable or inappropriate.  That the requirement of the soldier\'s affidavit to the fact essential to the existence of any right of the applicant under the law is both reasonable and appropriate can scarcely be doubted.  <em>United States v. Smull,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/236/405/case.html">236 U. S. 405</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/236/405/case.html#411">236 U. S. 411</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/238/case.html">United States v. Bailey,</a></span></em> 9 Pet. 238.  But defendant urges that the regulation is inconsistent with the statute, in that it adds to the requirements of the statute still another condition to be performed before the soldier can acquire his homestead, and hence is legislation, not regulation.  But the regulation does not add a new requirement in exacting the affidavit, as in <em>Williamson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/207/425/case.html">207 U. S. 425</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/207/425/case.html#458">207 U. S. 458</a></span>-462.  It merely demands appropriate evidence that the proceeding is initiated -- as the statute requires it must be throughout conducted -- in good faith, for the single purpose of acquiring a homestead.</p>\n<p>Great stress is laid upon the reference to "preemption cases" in Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2309, which provides that the soldier "may as well by an agent as in person enter upon such homestead by filing a declaratory statement as in preemption cases."  In proceedings under the preemption laws (Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2257-2288, repealed by Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 243 U. S. 615</a></p><p> of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095), an affidavit was not required either by the statute or by regulation (<em>see</em> 10 L.D. 687), and it is said that it cannot therefore be required under the provisions for soldiers in the Homestead Law.  But the reference in the latter statute carries no such implication.  It was inserted for a different purpose.  The general homestead law does not give the privilege of securing, in advance of formal entry, a preferential right to a particular location.  That is, it gives no right to prior selection, and none accrues from prior occupation save such as is given by \xc2\xa7 3 of the Act of May 14, 1880, c. 89, 21 Stat. 140.  Nor does the preemption law give a privilege to acquire, <em>merely</em> by selection, a preferential right to a particular parcel of land.  But under it, the person who actually "settles and improves" land may, in advance of entry under Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2262, acquire a preferential right over others, to the particular parcel, by filing with the register within thirty days thereafter (Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2264) "a written statement describing the land settled upon."  To that "written statement" the "declaratory statement" provided for by the provision for soldiers in the Homestead Law may be likened, but the conditions under which it is filed are very dissimilar.  The preemptioner must personally, before "filing," have actually entered upon the land, must have commenced settlement and improvement -- acts which, in themselves, furnish evidence that the proceeding has been initiated in good faith.  The soldier homesteader, on the other hand, need do nothing whatever to obtain a six months\' preferential right save file the declaratory statement, and that may be done by an agent -- a situation calling for extrinsic evidence by affidavit of the applicant\'s good faith.  Good reasons thus exist for a difference in requirements in the two classes of cases; but the power of the Land Department to require an affidavit to the declaratory statement even in preemption cases, as it did to declaratory statements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="616">Page 243 U. S. 616</a></p><p> under the Coal Land Law, seems not to have been questioned. (Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2348, 2349; 1 L.D. 687, paragraphs 28, 33.)  The regulation calling for an affidavit to a soldier\'s declaratory statement under the Homestead Law, unlike that considered in <em>United States v. George,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/14/case.html">228 U. S. 14</a></span>, is thus a regulation entirely consistent with the statutory provisions, and being also appropriate, is valid.</p>\n<p>2. <em>Whether state officers are authorized to administer the oath.</em></p>\n<p>The purpose of Congress in allowing filings to be made by an agent was to facilitate the acquisition of homesteads by soldiers living at a distance from the land to be settled on.  To their declaratory statements the several statutes [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] which provide for the administering of oaths by registers and receivers, or by the clerks of courts or United States commissioners in the district wherein the land is situated, are obviously not exclusively applicable, if applicable at all.  And plainly the provision of Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2293 relating to affidavits before the commanding officers of soldiers actually engaged in service is inapplicable.  The requirement of an affidavit to the declaratory statement, to be made by soldiers living elsewhere than in the land district, can be complied with only if an oath before some officer other than those specifically named in those statutes is recognized as being within the authority of law.  It follows that, to carry out the duties imposed by law, the Land Department was called upon to make appropriate provision for the administering of oaths in such cases, and the provision that soldiers\' declaratory statements, when filed by agent, "may be executed before any officer having a seal and authorized to administer oaths generally," is both appropriate and "not inconsistent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 243 U. S. 617</a></p><p> with law."  Ever since the decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/238/case.html">United States v. Bailey,</a></span></em> 9 Pet. 238,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/238/case.html#255">34 U. S. 255</a></span>, it has been held that an oath administered by a state magistrate, in pursuance of a valid regulation of one of the departments of the federal government, though without express authority from Congress, subjects the affiant to the penalties of the federal statute against false swearing.  <em>See Caha v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/211/case.html">152 U. S. 211</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/211/case.html#218">152 U.

Where a declaratory statement is filed by an agent, the agent\'s affidavit must be executed before one of the officers above mentioned, but the soldier\'s affidavit may be executed before any officer having a seal and authorized to administer oaths generally, and not necessarily within the land district in which the land is situated."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 2304:</p>\n<p>"Every private soldier . . . who has served in the Army of the United States during the recent rebellion . . . shall . . . be entitled to enter upon and receive patents for a quantity of public lands not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres . . . subject to entry under the homestead laws of the United States; but such homestead settler shall be allowed six months after locating his homestead, and filing his declaratory statement, . . . to make his entry and commence his settlement and improvement."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The term "entry" is used in the statutes, regulations, and decisions in several senses, sometimes to designate the initiatory proceeding whereby an inchoate right or privilege is acquired, sometimes as referring to final entries or proof, sometimes as referring to the proceeding as a whole.  <em>Dealy v.
