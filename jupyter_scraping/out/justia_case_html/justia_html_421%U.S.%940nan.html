Code Ann. 2905.34.</ul> <p> It is may view that \'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly \'obscene\' contents.\' Paries Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#113">413 U.S. 49, 113</a> (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, 2905.34, is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> (1973), suppression of any materials whatever on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="943">Page 421 U.S. 940 , 943</a></p><p> the basis of the definition of obscenity in 2905.34 is, in my view, impermissible.
