For many years it has been clearly established that a "prior restraint on expression comes to this Court with a \'heavy presumption\' against its constitutional validity." <i>Organization for a Better Austin </i>v. <i>Keefe, 402 </i>U. S. 415, 419 (1971), quoting <i>Carroll </i>v. <i>President and Comm\'rs of Princess Anne, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/175/case.html">393 U. S. 175</a>, 181 (1968). "Where ... a direct prior restraint is imposed upon the reporting of news by the media, each passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable infringement of the First Amendment." <i>Nebraska Press Assn. </i>v. <i>Stuart, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/1319/case.html">423 U. S. 1319</a>, 1329 (1975) (BLACKMUN, J., in chambers). As the Court recognized in <i>Nebraska Press Assn. </i>v. <i>Stuart, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/case.html">427 U. S. 539</a>, 559 (1976) (footnote omitted), prior restraints are particularly disfavored:</p><blockquote><p>\n"A criminal penalty or a judgment in a defamation case is subject to the whole panoply of protections afforded by deferring the impact of the judgment until all avenues of appellate review have been exhausted ....</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"A prior restraint, by contrast ... , has an immediate and irreversible sanction. If it can be said that a threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication \'chills\' speech, prior restraint \'freezes\' it at least for the time."</p></blockquote><p>Although the prohibition against prior restraints is by no means absolute, the gagging of publication has been considered acceptable only in "exceptional cases." <i>Near </i>v. <i>Minnesota ex rel. Olson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/case.html">283 U. S. 697</a>, 716 (1931). Even where questions of allegedly urgent national security, see <i>New York Times Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/713/case.html">403 U. S. 713</a> (1971), or competing constitutional interests, <i>Nebraska Press Assn., </i>427 U. S., at 559, are concerned, we have imposed this "most extraordinary remed[yJ" only where the evil that would result from the reportage is both great and certain and cannot be mitigated by less intrusive measures. <i>Id., </i>at 562.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="1318">1318</a></p><p>Opinion in Chambers</p><p>Federal has not met this burden here. The Circuit Court no doubt is correct that broadcast of the videotape "could" result in significant economic harm to Federal. Even if economic harm were sufficient in itself to justify a prior restraint, however, we previously have refused to rely on such speculative predictions as based on "factors unknown and unknowable." <i>Id., </i>at 563; see also <i>New York Times Co. </i>v. <i>United States, supra.</i></p><p>Nor is the prior restraint doctrine inapplicable because the videotape was obtained through the "calculated misdeeds" of CBS. In <i>New York Times Co., </i>the Court refused to suppress publication of papers stolen from the Pentagon by a third party. Subsequent civil or criminal proceedings, rather than prior restraints, ordinarily are the appropriate sanction for calculated defamation or other misdeeds in the First Amendment context. Even if criminal activity by the broadcaster could justify an exception to the prior restraint doctrine under some circumstances, the record as developed thus far contains no clear evidence of criminal activity on the part of CBS, and the court below found none.</p><p>I conclude that the decision below conflicts with the prior decisions of this Court, that there is a reasonable probability that the case would warrant certiorari, and that indefinite delay of the broadcast will cause irreparable harm to the news media that is intolerable under the First Amendment. Entry of a stay therefore is appropriate under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1651. See <i>INS </i>v. <i>Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, ante, </i>at 1301 (O\'CONNOR, J., in chambers). If CBS has breached its state-law obligations, the First Amendment requires that Federal remedy its harms through a damages proceeding rather than through suppression of protected speech.</p><p>The Circuit Court\'s injunction is therefore stayed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
