JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Certiorari was granted in this case "limited to the question of the right of the taxpayer to deductions on account of amortization of bond discount."  At various dates between 1913 and 1916, Meridian &amp; Memphis Railway Company sold its thirty-year 5% gold bonds at a discount.  During the years 1924 to 1926, inclusive, while petitioner was the owner and holder of the entire bond issue, it joined with the Meridian &amp; Memphis in filing consolidated income tax returns as affiliated corporations.  In each year, the latter deducted from gross income the amortized bond discount.  The deductions were disallowed by the Commissioner.  His action was sustained by the Board of Tax </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 293 U.

Helvering, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/289/case.html">293 U. S. 289</a></span>.
