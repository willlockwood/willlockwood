In 1977, they brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against petitioners -- various governmental entities and officials from New York, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] New Jersey, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and the Federal Government. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Their complaint alleged that sewage, sewage "sludge," and other waste materials were being discharged into New York Harbor and the Hudson </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 453 U. S. 5</a></p><p> River by some of the petitioners.  In addition, it complained of the dumping of such materials directly into the ocean from maritime vessels.  The complaint alleged that, as a result of these activities, the Atlantic Ocean was becoming polluted, and it made special reference to a massive growth of algae said to have appeared offshore in 1976. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It then stated that this pollution was causing the "collapse of the fishing, clamming and lobster industries which operate in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Invoking a wide variety of legal theories, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief, $250 million in compensatory damages, and $250 million in punitive damages.  The District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] on all counts of the complaint. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 453 U. S. 6</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In holdings relevant here, the District Court rejected respondents\' nuisance claim under federal common law, <em>see Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html">406 U. S. 91</a></span> (1972), on the ground that such a cause of action is not available to private parties.  With respect to the claims based on alleged violations of the FWPCA, the court noted that respondents had failed to comply with the 60-day notice requirement of the "citizen suit" provision in \xc2\xa7 505(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 86 Stat. 888, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365 (b)(1)(A).  This provision allows suits under the Act by private citizens, but authorizes only prospective relief, and the citizen plaintiffs first must give notice to the EPA, the State, and any alleged violator.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 453 U. S. 7</a></p><p> respondents did not give the requisite notice, the court refused to allow them to proceed with a claim under the Act independent of the citizen suit provision and based on the general jurisdictional grant in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The court applied the same analysis to respondents\' claims under the MPRSA, which contains similar citizen suit and notice provisions.  33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1415(g). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Finally, the court rejected a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 453 U. S. 8</a></p><p> possible claim of maritime tort, both because respondents had failed to plead such claim explicitly and because they had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the federal and state Tort Claims Acts. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed as to the claims based on the FWPCA, the MPRSA, the federal common law of nuisance, and maritime tort.  <em>National</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 453 U. S. 9</a></p><p> <em>Sea Clammers Assn. v. City of New York,</em> 616 F.2d 1222 (1980).  With respect to the FWPCA, the court held that failure to comply with the 60-day notice provision in \xc2\xa7 505(b)(1)(A), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365 (b)(1)(A), does not preclude suits under the Act in addition to the specific "citizen suits" authorized in \xc2\xa7 505.  It based this conclusion on the saving clause in \xc2\xa7 505 (e), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365 (e), preserving</p>\n<p>"any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief."</p>\n<p>616 F.2d at 1221228; <em>see</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  The Court of Appeals then went on to apply our precedents in the area of implied statutory rights of action, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and concluded that</p>\n<p>"Congress intended to permit the federal courts to entertain a private cause of action implied from the terms of the [FWPCA], preserved by the savings clause of the Act, on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals who have been or will be injured by pollution in violation of its terms."</p>\n<p>616 F.2d at 1230-1231.</p>\n<p>The court then applied this same analysis to the MPRSA, concluding again that the District Court had erred in dismissing respondents\' claims under this Act.  Although the court was not explicit on this question, it apparently concluded that suits for <em>damages,</em> as well as for injunctive relief, could be brought under the FWPCA and the MPRSA. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 453 U. S. 10</a></p><p></p>\n<p>With respect to the federal common law nuisance claims, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court\'s conclusion that private parties may not bring such claims.  It also held, applying common law principles, that respondents "alleged sufficient individual damage to permit them to recover damages for this essentially public nuisance."  <em>Id.</em> at 1234.  It thus went considerably beyond <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html">406 U.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitions for a writ of certiorari raising a variety of argument were filed in this Court by a group of New Jersey sewerage authorities (No. 79-1711), by the Joint Meeting of Essex and Union Counties in New Jersey (No. 79-1754), by the City and Mayor of New York (No. 79-1760), and by all of the federal defendants named in this suit (No. 80-12). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  We granted these petitions, limiting review to three questions:  (i) whether FWPCA and MPRSA imply a private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 453 U.

We hold that there is no implied right of action under these statutes, and that the federal common law of nuisance has been fully preempted in the area of ocean pollution. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act was first enacted in 1948.  Act of June 30, 1948, 62 Stat. 1155.  It emphasized state enforcement of water quality standards.  When this legislation proved ineffective, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251 <em>et seq.</em>  The Amendments shifted the emphasis to "direct restrictions on discharges," <em>EPA v.

Section 101(a) of the Act requires a permit for any dumping into ocean waters, when the material is transported from the United States or on an American vessel or aircraft.  33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1411(a). [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  In addition, it requires a permit for the dumping of material transported from outside the United States into the territorial seas or in the zone extending 12 miles from the coastline, "to the extent that it may affect the territorial sea or the territory of the United States."  \xc2\xa7 1411(b).</p>\n<p>The exact nature of respondents\' claims under these two Acts is not clear, but the claims appear to fall into two categories.  The main contention is that the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have permitted the New Jersey and New York defendants to discharge and dump pollutants in amounts that are not permitted by the Acts.  In addition, they seem to allege that the New York and New Jersey defendants have violated the terms of their permits.  The question before us is whether respondents may raise either of these claims in a private suit for injunctive and monetary relief, where such a suit is not expressly authorized by either of these Acts.

As we stated in <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, supra,</em></p>\n<p>"it is an elemental canon of statutory construction that, where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 453 U. S. 15</a></p><p> of reading others into it."</p>\n<p>444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html#19">444 U. S. 19</a></span>.  <em>See also Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#571">442 U. S. 571</a></span>-574.  In the absence of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, we are compelled to conclude that Congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the Court of Appeals avoided this inference.  Discussing the FWPCA, it held that the existence of a citizen suit provision in \xc2\xa7 505(a) does not rule out implied forms of private enforcement of the Act.  It arrived at this conclusion by asserting that Congress intended in \xc2\xa7 505(a) to create a limited cause of action for "private attorneys general" -- "non-injured member[s] of the public" suing to promote the general welfare, rather than to redress an injury to their own welfare.  616 F.2d at 1227.  It went on to conclude:</p>\n<p>"A private party who is <em>injured</em> by the alleged violation, as these plaintiffs allege they were, has an alternate basis for suit under section 505(e), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365(e), and the general federal question jurisdiction of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331(1976).  Section 505(e) is a savings clause that preserves all rights to enforce the Act or seek relief against the Administrator.  Coupled with the general federal question jurisdiction, it permits this suit to be brought by these parties."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (footnotes omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p>There are at least three problems with this reasoning.  First, the language of the saving clause on which the Court of Appeals relied, <em>see</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra,</em> is quite ambiguous concerning the intent of Congress to "preserve" remedies under the  WPCA itself.  It merely states that nothing in the citizen suit provision</p>\n<p>"shall restrict any right which any person . . . may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief."</p>\n<p>It is doubtful that the phrase "any statute" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 453 U. S. 16</a></p><p> includes the very statute in which this statement was contained. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the reasoning on which the Court of Appeals relied is flawed for another reason.  It draws a distinction between "non-injured" plaintiffs who may bring citizen suits to enforce provisions of these Acts, and the "injured" plaintiffs in this litigation, who claim a right to sue under the Acts not by virtue of the citizen suit provisions, but rather under the language of the saving clauses.  In fact, it is clear that the citizen suit provisions apply only to persons who can claim some sort of injury, and there is, therefore, no reason to infer the existence of a separate right of action for "injured" plaintiffs.  "Citizen" is defined in the citizen suit section of the FWPCA as "a person or persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected."  \xc2\xa7 505(g), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365(g).  It is clear from the Senate Conference Report that this phrase was intended by Congress to allow suits by all persons possessing standing under this Court\'s decision in <em>Sierra Club v. Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/727/case.html">405 U. S. 727</a></span> (1972).  <em>See</em> S.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 146 (1972).  This broad category </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 453 U. S. 17</a></p><p> of potential plaintiffs necessarily includes both plaintiffs seeking to enforce these statutes as private attorneys general, whose injuries are "noneconomic" and probably noncompensable, and persons, like respondents, who assert that they have suffered tangible economic injuries because of statutory violations.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals failed to take account of the rest of the enforcement scheme expressly provided by Congress -- including the opportunity for "any interested person" to seek judicial review of a number of EPA actions within 90 days, \xc2\xa7 509(b), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1369(b).  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#13">453 U. S. 13</a></span>-14.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also applied its reasoning to the MPRSA.  But, here again, we are persuaded that Congress evidenced no intent to authorize by implication private remedies under these Acts apart from the expressly authorized citizen suits.  The relevant provisions in the MPRSA are in many respects almost identical to those of the FWPCA.  33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1415(g).  Although they do not expressly limit citizen suits to those who have suffered some injury from a violation of the Act, we are not persuaded by this fact alone that Congress affirmatively intended to imply the existence of a parallel private remedy, after setting out expressly the manner in which private citizens can seek to enjoin violations.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span> (1975), the Court identified several factors that are relevant to the question of implied private remedies.  These include the legislative history.  <em>See ibid.</em> ("Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?").  This history does not lead to a contrary conclusion with respect to implied remedies under either Act.  Indeed, the Report and debates provide affirmative support for the view that Congress intended the limitations imposed on citizen suits to apply to all private suits under these Acts. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 453 U. S. 18</a></p><p> Thus, both the structure of the Acts and their legislative history lead us to conclude that Congress intended that private remedies in addition to those expressly provided should not be implied. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Where, as here, Congress has made clear that implied private actions are not contemplated, the courts are not authorized to ignore this legislative judgment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 453 U. S. 19</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the parties have not suggested it, there remains a possible alternative source of <em>express</em> congressional authorization of private suits under these Acts.  Last Term, in <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span> (1980), the Court construed 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 as authorizing suits to redress violations by state officials of rights created by federal statutes.  Accordingly, it could be argued that respondents may sue the municipalities and sewerage boards among the petitioners [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] under the FWPCA and MPRSA by virtue of a right of action created by \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>It is appropriate to reach the question of the applicability of <em>Maine v. Thiboutot</em> to this setting despite the failure of respondents to raise it here or below.  This litigation began long before that decision.  Moreover, if controlling, this argument would obviate the need to consider whether Congress intended to authorize private suits to enforce these particular federal statutes.  The claim brought here arguably falls within the scope of <em>Maine v. Thiboutot</em> because it involves a suit by a private party claiming that a federal statute has been violated under color of state law, causing an injury.  The Court, however, has recognized two exceptions to the application of \xc2\xa7 1983 to statutory violations.  In <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U. S. 1</a></span> (1981), we remanded certain claims for a determination (i) whether Congress had foreclosed private enforcement of that statute in the enactment itself, and (ii) whether the statute at issue there was the kind that created enforceable "rights" under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#8">451 U. S. 8</a></span>.  In the present cases, because we find that Congress foreclosed a \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy under these Acts, we need not reach the second question, whether these Acts created "rights, privileges, or immunities" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 453 U. S. 20</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When the remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under \xc2\xa7 1983.  As JUSTICE STEWART, who later joined the majority in <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> stated in <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#673">441 U. S. 673</a></span>, n. 2 (1979) (dissenting opinion), when</p>\n<p>"a state official is alleged to have violated a federal statute which provides its own comprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit directly under \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]"</p>\n<p>As discussed above, the FWPCA and MPRSA do provide quite comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.  It is hard to believe that Congress intended to preserve the \xc2\xa7 1983 right of action when it created so many specific statutory remedies, including the two citizen suit provisions. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  <em>See Chesapeake Bay Foundation v. Virginia State</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 453 U. S. 21</a></p><p> <em>Water Control Board,</em> 501 F.Supp. 821(ED Va.1980) (rejecting a 1983 action under the FWPCA against the Chairman of a State Water Board, with reasoning based on the comprehensiveness of the remedies provided and the federalism concerns raised).  We therefore conclude that the existence of these express remedies demonstrates not only that Congress intended to foreclose implied private actions, but also that it intended to supplant any remedy that otherwise would be available under \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Cf. Carlson v. Green,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/14/case.html">446 U. S. 14</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/14/case.html#23">446 U. S. 23</a></span> (1980).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The remaining two issues on which we granted certiorari relate to respondents\' federal claims based on the federal common law of nuisance.  The principal precedent on which these claims were based is <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html">406 U. S. 91</a></span> (1972), where the Court found that the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider the federal common law issues raised by a suit for injunctive relief by the State of Illinois against various Wisconsin municipalities and public sewerage commissions, involving the discharge of sewage into Lake Michigan.  In these cases, we need not decide whether a cause of action may be brought under federal common law by a private plaintiff, seeking damages.  The Court has now held </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 453 U. S. 22</a></p><p> that the federal common law of nuisance in the area of water pollution is entirely preempted by the more comprehensive scope of the FWPCA, which was completely revised soon after the decision in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee.</em> <em>See Milwaukee v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html">451 U. S. 304</a></span> (1981).</p>\n<p>This decision disposes entirely of respondents\' federal common law claims, since there is no reason to suppose that the preemptive effect of the FWPCA is any less when pollution of coastal waters is at issue.  To the extent that this litigation involves ocean waters not covered by the FWPCA, and regulated under the MPRSA, we see no cause for different treatment of the preemption question.  The regulatory scheme of the MPRSA is no less comprehensive, with respect to ocean dumping than are analogous provisions of the FWPCA. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>We therefore must dismiss the federal common law claims, because their underlying legal basis is now preempted by statute.  As discussed above, we also dismiss the claims under the MPRSA and the FWPCA, because respondents lack a right of action under these statutes.  We vacate the judgment below with respect to these two claims, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with No. 79-1754, <em>Joint Meeting of Essex and Union Counties v.

But the court did not conclude that the saving clause is itself an express authorization of private damages suits.  Instead, it held that the saving clause acted to preserve any existing right to enforce the Act, in addition to the explicit, citizen suit remedy in \xc2\xa7 505(b).

I would argue that the citizen suit provision of S. 4358 has been carefully drafted to prevent this consequence from arising.  First of all, it should be noted that the bill makes no provision for damages to the individual.  It therefore provides no incentives to suit other than to protect the health and welfare of those suing and others similarly situated.

The language of these clauses, <em>see</em> nn.  <a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a> <a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a> <em>supra,</em> does not, however, support the view that Congress expressly preserved \xc2\xa7 1983 remedies for violations of <em>these statutes.</em>  As noted <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#15">453 U. S. 15</a></span>-16, there is little reason to believe that Congress intended to do this when it made reference in \xc2\xa7 505(e) to "any right which any person . . . may have under any statute or common law or to seek . . . any other relief."  The legislative history makes clear Congress\' intent to allow further enforcement of anti-pollution standards arising under <em>other</em> statutes or state common law.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F26" name="T26">n</a> 26, <em>supra.</em>  A suit for damages asserting a substantive violation of the FWPCA or the MPRSA is far different, even if the <em>remedy</em> asserted is based on the separate right of action created in \xc2\xa7 1983.  We are convinced that the saving clauses do not refer at all to a suit for redress of a violation of these statutes -- regardless of the source of the right of action asserted.</p>\n<p>Even if this were not the correct interpretation of the saving clauses, we recently held that the saving clause in the FWPCA relates only to the effect of the accompanying citizen suit provision.  <em>Milwaukee v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html">451 U. S. 304</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#329">451 U. S. 329</a></span> (1981) (the section "means only that the provision of [a citizen] suit does not revoke other remedies").  The parallel provision of the MPRSA is equally limited.  33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1415(g) (5) ("The injunctive <em>relief provided by this subsection</em> shall not restrict any right which any person . . . may have under any statute or common law") (emphasis added).  We therefore are not persuaded that the saving clauses limit the effect of the overall remedial schemes provided expressly in the Acts.  In sum, we think it clear that those express remedies preclude suits for damages under \xc2\xa7 1983, and that the saving clauses do not require a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p>In so holding, we also note that, contrary to JUSTICE STEVENS\' argument, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#27">453 U. S. 27</a></span>-28, n. 11, we do not suggest that the burden is on a plaintiff to demonstrate congressional intent to preserve \xc2\xa7 1983 remedies.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T32" name="F32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, as noted in  <a href="#F14" name="T14">n</a> 14, <em>supra,</em> the ocean dumping of sewage sludge must end altogether by December 31, 1981.  To the extent that Congress allowed some continued dumping of sludge prior to that date, this represents a considered judgment that it made sense to allow entities like petitioners to adjust to the coming change.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>When should a person injured by a violation of federal law be allowed to recover his damages in a federal court?  This seemingly simple question has recently presented the Court with more difficulty than most substantive questions that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 453 U. S. 23</a></p><p> come before us. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  During most of our history, however, a simple presumption usually provided the answer.  Although criminal laws and legislation enacted for the benefit of the public at large were expected to be enforced by public officials, a statute enacted for the benefit of a special class presumptively afforded a remedy for members of that class injured by violations of the statute.  <em>See Texas  Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/33/case.html">241 U. S. 33</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/387/case.html#390">241 U. S. 390</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Applying that presumption, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 453 U. S. 24</a></p><p> our truly conservative federal judges -- men like Justice Harlan, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] Justice Clark, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] Justice Frankfurter, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and Judge Kirkpatrick [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] -- readily concluded that it was appropriate to allow private parties who had been injured by a violation of a statute enacted for their special benefit to obtain judicial relief.  For rules are meant to be obeyed, and those who violate them should be held responsible for their misdeeds.  <em>See Rigsby, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/33/case.html#39">241 U. S. 39</a></span>.  Since the earliest days of the common law, it has been the business of courts to fashion remedies for wrongs. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>In recent years, however, a Court that is properly concerned about the burdens imposed upon the federal judiciary, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 453 U. S. 25</a></p><p> quality of the work product of Congress, and the sheer bulk of new federal legislation, has been more and more reluctant to open the courthouse door to the injured citizen.  In 1975, in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>, the Court cut back on the simple common law presumption by fashioning a four-factor formula that led to the denial of relief in that case. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Although multifactor balancing tests generally tend to produce negative answers, more recently some Members of the Court have been inclined to deny relief with little more than a perfunctory nod to the <em>Cort v. Ash</em> factors.  <em>See, e.g., California v. Sierra Club,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/287/case.html">451 U. S. 287</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/287/case.html#302">451 U. S. 302</a></span> (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment).  The touchstone now is congressional intent.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#13">453 U. S. 13</a></span>.  Because legislative history is unlikely to reveal affirmative evidence of a congressional intent to authorize a specific procedure that the statute itself fails to mention, [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] that touchstone will further restrict the availability of private remedies.</p>\n<p>Although I agree with the Court\'s disposition of the "implied private right of action" question in these cases, I write separately to emphasize that the Court\'s current approach to the judicial task of fashioning appropriate remedies for violations of federal statutes is out of step with the Court\'s own </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 453 U. S. 26</a></p><p> history and tradition.  More importantly, I believe that the Court\'s appraisal of the intent expressed by Congress in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Clean Water Act), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1251 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III), and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA), 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1401 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III), with respect to the availability of private remedies under other federal statutes or the federal common law is palpably wrong.</p>\n<p>In the present context of these cases, we of course know nothing about the ultimate merits of the claims asserted by respondents.  As the cases come to us, however, we must make certain assumptions in analyzing the questions presented.  First, we must assume that the complaint speaks the truth when it alleges that the petitioners have dumped large quantities of sewage and toxic waste in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries, and that these dumping operations have violated the substantive provisions of the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA.  <em>See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/77/case.html">451 U. S. 77</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/77/case.html#80">451 U. S. 80</a></span>, n. 3.  Second, we must also assume that these illegal operations have caused an injury to respondents\' commercial interests.  Third, because some of the petitioners are "persons" who allegedly acted under color of state law, as the Court recognizes, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#19">453 U. S. 19</a></span>, and n. 29, we must assume that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. III) [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] provides an express remedy for their violations of these two federal statutes, unless Congress has expressly withdrawn that remedy.  <em>See Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span>.  Finally, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 453 U. S. 27</a></p><p> we must assume that, apart from these two statutes, the dumping operations of petitioners would constitute a common law nuisance for which respondents would have a federal remedy.  The net effect of the Court\'s analysis of the legislative intent is therefore a conclusion that Congress, by enacting the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA, deliberately deprived respondents of effective federal remedies that would otherwise have been available to them.  In my judgment, the language of both statutes, as well as their legislative history, belies this improbable conclusion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding that Congress decided in the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA to withdraw the express remedy provided by 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. III) seems to rest on nothing more than the fact that these statutes provide other express remedies, and do not mention \xc2\xa7 1983.  Because the enforcement mechanisms provided in the statutes are "quite comprehensive," the Court finds it "hard to believe that Congress intended to preserve the \xc2\xa7 1983 right of action. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#20">453 U. S. 20</a></span>.  There are at least two flaws in this reasoning.  First, the question is not whether Congress "intended to preserve the \xc2\xa7 1983 right of action," but rather whether Congress intended to withdraw that right of action. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Second, I find it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 453 U. S. 28</a></p><p> not at all hard to believe that Congress intended to preserve, or, more precisely, did not intend to withdraw, the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy because Congress made this intention explicit in the language of both statutes and in the relevant legislative history.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that the remedial provisions of the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA are "quite comprehensive."  I cannot agree, however, with the Court\'s implicit conclusion that this determination ends the inquiry under <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, supra.</em>  The question that must be answered in determining whether respondents may pursue their claims under \xc2\xa7 1983 is whether Congress intended that the remedies provided in the substantive statutes be exclusive.  <em>See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#28">451 U. S. 28</a></span>.  Because Congress did not expressly address this question in the statutes, the Court looks elsewhere for an answer and finds it in the comprehensive character of the express statutory remedies.  I have no quarrel, as a general matter, with the proposition that a comprehensive remedial scheme can evidence a congressional decision to preclude other remedies.  <em>Cf. Northwest Airlines, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/77/case.html#93">451 U. S. 93</a></span>-94.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that our evaluation of a statute\'s express remedies is merely a tool used to discern congressional intent; it is not an end in itself.  No matter how comprehensive we may consider a statute\'s remedial scheme to be, Congress is at liberty to leave other remedial avenues open.  Express statutory language or clear references in the legislative history will rebut whatever presumption of exclusivity arises from comprehensive remedial provisions.  In my judgment, in these cases, we are presented with both express statutory language and clear references in the legislative history indicating that Congress did not intend the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 453 U. S. 29</a></p><p> express remedies in the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA to be exclusive.</p>\n<p>Despite their comprehensive enforcement mechanisms, both statutes expressly preserve all legal remedies otherwise available.  The statutes state in so many words that the authorization of an express remedy in the statute itself shall not give rise to an inference that Congress intended to foreclose other remedies.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 505(e) of the Clean Water Act states:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief (including relief against the Administrator or a State agency)."</p>\n<p>33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1365(e).  And \xc2\xa7 105(g) (5) of the MPRSA states:</p>\n<p>"The injunctive relief provided by this subsection shall not restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any standard or limitation or to seek any other relief (including relief against the Administrator, the Secretary, or a State agency)."</p>\n<p>33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1415(g) (5).  Respondents\' right to proceed under \xc2\xa7 1983 in light of these statutory provisions could have been made more plain only had Congress substituted the citation "42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983" for the words "any statute" in the saving clauses.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of both statutes makes it clear that the saving clauses were intended to mean what they say.  The Senate Report on the Clean Water Act states:</p>\n<p>"It should be noted, however, that the section would specifically preserve any rights or remedies under any other law.  Thus, if damages could be shown, other remedies would remain available.  Compliance with requirements under this Act would not be a defense to a common </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 453 U. S. 30</a></p><p> law action for pollution damages."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-414, p. 81 (1971).  <em>See also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 92-911, p. 134 (1972).  And the corresponding Report on the MPRSA similarly states that the authorization of citizen suits shall not restrict or supersede "any other right to legal action which is afforded the potential litigant in any other statute or the common law."  S.Rep. No. 9251, pp. 23-24 (1971).  <em>See also</em> H.R.Rep. No. 92-361, p. 23 (1971).</p>\n<p>The words "any other law" in the former Report and "any other statute" in the latter surely encompass 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. III), as do the words "any statute" in the saving clauses themselves.  It therefore seems little short of remarkable that unambiguous expressions of legislative intent such as these can be read to express a purpose to withdraw the express statutory remedy provided by \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>The Court, of course, discusses the saving clauses and this legislative history elsewhere in its opinion.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#15">453 U. S. 15</a></span>-17, and n. 26.  In rejecting the Court of Appeals\' conclusion, based in part on the saving clauses, that respondents may invoke implied rights of action under the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA, the Court finds it "doubtful" that the phrase "any statute" in the saving clauses refers to the very statutes in which the clauses appear.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#15">453 U. S. 15</a></span>-16.

Thus, the Court holds that the statutory phrase "any statute" does not refer to the Clean Water Act or the MPRSA; the Court apparently also holds that it does not refer to \xc2\xa7 1983, even though that statute clearly qualifies as "any other statute" or "any other law," within the meaning of the legislative history. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 453 U. S. 31</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In my judgment, the Court has failed to uncover "a clear congressional mandate" [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] to withdraw the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy otherwise available to the respondents.  Moreover, the statutory language and the legislative history reveal the exact opposite:  a clear congressional mandate to preserve all existing remedies, including a private right of action under \xc2\xa7 1983.  I therefore respectfully dissent from this portion of the Court\'s decision.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The effect of the Court\'s holding in <em>Milwaukee v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html">451 U. S. 304</a></span>, was to make the city of Milwaukee\'s compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act a complete defense to a federal common law nuisance action for pollution damage.  It was, and still is, difficult for me to reconcile that holding with the excerpts from the statutes and the Senate Reports quoted above -- particularly the statement:</p>\n<p>"Compliance with requirements under this Act would not be a defense to a common law action for pollution damages."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-414 at 81.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court pursues the preemption rationale of <em>Milwaukee v. Illinois</em> to its inexorable conclusion, and holds that even noncompliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA is a defense to a federal common law nuisance claim. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Because JUSTICE BLACKMUN has already </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 453 U. S. 32</a></p><p> exposed in detail the flaws in the Court\'s treatment of this issue, <em>see Milwaukee v. Illinois, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html#333">451 U. S. 333</a></span>-347 (dissenting opinion), I merely note that the reasoning in his dissenting opinion in <em>Milwaukee</em> applies with special force in this case. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although I agree with the Court\' holding that neither of these statutes implicitly authorizes a private damages remedy, I reach that conclusion by a different route.  Under the traditional common law analysis discussed <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#23">453 U. S. 23</a></span>-24, the primary question is whether the statute was enacted for the special benefit of a particular class of which the plaintiff is a member.  <em>See Texas  Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,</em> 241 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/241/387/case.html#390">241 U. S. 390</a></span>.  As we have held in the past, "[t]hat question is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 453 U. S. 33</a></p><p> answered by looking to the language of the statute itself."  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#689">441 U. S. 689</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The language of neither the Clean Water Act nor the MPRSA defines any such special class.  Both the substantive provisions of these statutes and the breadth of their authorizations of citizen suits indicate that they were "enacted for the protection of the general public."  <em>Cannon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#690">441 U. S. 690</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Thus, even under the more liberal approach to implied rights of action represented by <em>Rigsby</em> and its antecedents, respondents cannot invoke implied private remedies under these statutes.  <em>See generally California v. Sierra Club,</em> 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/287/case.html#294">451 U. S. 294</a></span>-296.</p>\n<p>The conclusion required by the statutory language is fortified by the legislative history on which the Court relies.  I agree that the legislative deliberations about civil remedies under the Clean Air Act, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#17">453 U. S. 17</a></span>-18, n. 27, illuminate the meaning of the Clean Water Act and the MPRSA -- since these statutes were enacted only a short time later and had similar environmental objective -- and that those deliberations reveal a conscious congressional choice not to authorize a new statutory damages remedy.  Accordingly, I agree with the conclusion reached by the Court in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#13">453 U. S. </a></span> but I respectfully dissent from the remainder of its judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, in recent Terms, a significant portion of our docket has been occupied by cases presenting this question with respect to a variety of federal statutes.  <em>See, e.g., California v.

As the Court formulates the inquiry, the burden is placed on the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff to show an explicit or implicit congressional intention that violations of the substantive statute at issue be redressed in private \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  The correct formulation, however, places the burden on the defendant to show that Congress intended to foreclose access to the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy as a means of enforcing the substantive statute.  Because the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff is invoking an express private remedy that is, on its face, applicable anytime a violation of a federal statute is alleged, <em>see Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#4">448 U. S. 4</a></span>, the burden is properly placed on the defendant to show that Congress, in enacting the particular substantive statute at issue, intended an exception to the general rule of \xc2\xa7 1983.  A defendant may carry this burden by identifying express statutory language or legislative history revealing Congress\' intent to foreclose the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy, or by establishing that Congress intended that the remedies provided in the substantive statute itself be exclusive.  <em>See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
