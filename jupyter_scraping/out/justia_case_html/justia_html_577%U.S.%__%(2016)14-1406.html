In 1865, the Omaha Tribe again entered into a treaty with the United States agreeing to \xe2\x80\x9ccede, sell, and convey\xe2\x80\x9d land for a fixed sum.  When, in 1872, the Tribe sought to sell more of its land to the United States, Congress took a different tack.  In lieu of a fixed-sum purchase, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to survey, appraise, and sell tracts of reservation land to western settlers and to deposit any proceeds from the land sales in the U.\xc2\xa0S. Treasury for the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.  Congress took the same approach in 1882 when it passed the Act in question.  That Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to survey, appraise, and sell roughly 50,000 acres of reservation land lying west of a railroad right-of-way.  W. E. Peebles purchased a tract under the terms of the 1882 Act and established the village of Pender.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2006, the Tribe amended its Beverage Control Ordinance and sought to subject Pender retailers to the amended ordinance.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71161 (permitting tribes to regulate liquor sales on reservation land and in \xe2\x80\x9cIndian country\xe2\x80\x9d).  Pender and its retailers brought a suit against the Tribe in Federal District Court to challenge the ordinance, and the State intervened on their behalf.  They alleged that they were not within the reservation boundaries or in Indian country and therefore could not be subject to the ordinance.  They sought declaratory relief and a permanent injunction prohibiting the Tribe from asserting its jurisdiction over the disputed land.  Concluding that the 1882 Act did not diminish the Omaha Reservation, the District Court denied relief, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The 1882 Act did not diminish the Omaha Indian Reservation.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s framework for determining whether an Indian reservation has been diminished is well settled and starts with the statutory text.  <i>Hagen</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399\n.  Here, the 1882 Act bears none of the common textual indications that express such clear intent, <i>e.g., </i>\xe2\x80\x9c[e]xplicit reference to cession or other language evidencing the present and total surrender of all tribal interests\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9can unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate the Indian tribe for its opened land,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Solem</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 470.

Here, such historical evidence cannot overcome the text of the 1882 Act, which lacks any indication that Congress intended to diminish the reservation.  Dueling remarks by legislators about the 1882 Act are far from the unequivocal evidence required in diminishment cases.

See<i> Solem, supra,</i> at 471\xe2\x80\x93472.  This Court has never relied solely on this third consideration to find diminishment, and the mixed record of subsequent treatment of the disputed land in this case cannot overcome the statutory text.  Petitioners point to the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the disputed territory for more than 120 years, but this subsequent demographic history is the \xe2\x80\x9cleast compelling\xe2\x80\x9d evidence in the diminishment analysis.  <i>South Dakota </i>v. <i>Yankton Sioux Tribe</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 329\n.  Likewise, evidence of the subsequent treatment of the disputed land by government officials has similarly limited value.

By the mid-19th century, the Tribe was destitute and, in exchange for much-needed revenue, agreed to sell a large swath of its land to the United States.  In 1854, the Tribe entered into a treaty with the United States to create a 300,000-acre reservation.  Treaty with the Omahas (1854 Treaty), Mar. 16, 1854,\n\n10Stat.\n1043.  The Tribe agreed to \xe2\x80\x9ccede\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforever relinquish all right and title to\xe2\x80\x9d its land west of the Mississippi River, excepting the reservation, in exchange for $840,000, to be paid over 40 years.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1043\xe2\x80\x931044.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1865, after the displaced Wisconsin Winnebago Tribe moved west, the Omaha Tribe agreed to \xe2\x80\x9ccede, sell, and convey\xe2\x80\x9d an additional 98,000 acres on the north side of the reservation to the United States for the purpose of creating a reservation for the Winnebagoes.  Treaty with the Omaha Indians (1865 Treaty), Mar. 6, 1865,\n\n14Stat.\n667\xe2\x80\x93668.  The Tribe sold the land for a fixed sum of $50,000.  <i>Id</i>., at 667.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1872, the Tribe again expressed its wish to sell portions of the reservation, but Congress took a different tack than it had in the 1854 and 1865 Treaties.  Instead of purchasing a portion of the reservation for a fixed sum, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to survey, appraise, and sell up to 50,000 acres on the western side of the reservation \xe2\x80\x9cto be separated from the remaining portion of said reservation\xe2\x80\x9d by a north-south line agreed to by the Tribe and Congress.  Act of June 10, 1872 (1872 Act), ch. 436, \xc2\xa71,\n\n17Stat.\n391.  Under the 1872 Act, a nonmember could purchase \xe2\x80\x9ctracts not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres each\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire body offered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Proceeds from any sales would be \xe2\x80\x9cplaced to the credit of said Indians on the books of the treasury of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  But the proceeds were meager.  The 1872 Act resulted in only two sales totaling 300.72 acres.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Then came the 1882 Act, central to the dispute between petitioners and respondents.  In that Act, Congress again empowered the Secretary of the Interior \xe2\x80\x9cto cause to be surveyed, if necessary, and sold\xe2\x80\x9d more than 50,000 acres lying west of a right-of-way granted by the Tribe and approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 1880 for use by the Sioux City and Nebraska Railroad Company.  Act of Aug. 7, 1882 (1882 Act),\n\n22Stat.\n341.  The land for sale under the terms of the 1882 Act overlapped substantially with the land Congress tried, but failed, to sell in 1872.  Once the land was appraised \xe2\x80\x9cin tracts of forty acres each,\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary was \xe2\x80\x9cto issue [a] proclamation\xe2\x80\x9d that the \xe2\x80\x9clands are open for settlement under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 2, <i>id.,</i> at 341.  Within one year of that proclamation, a nonmember could purchase up to 160 acres of land (for no less than $2.50 per acre) in cash paid to the United States, so long as the settler \xe2\x80\x9coccup[ied]\xe2\x80\x9d it, made \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable improvements thereon,\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9ca citizen of the United States, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. declared his intention to become such.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72, <i>id.,</i> at 341.  The proceeds from any land sales, \xe2\x80\x9cafter paying all expenses incident to and necessary for carrying out the provisions of th[e] act,\xe2\x80\x9d were to \xe2\x80\x9cbe placed to the credit of said Indians in the Treasury of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73, <i>id.,</i> at 341<i>.</i>  Interest earned on the proceeds was to be \xe2\x80\x9cannu-ally expended for the benefit of said Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 1882 Act also included a provision, common in the late 19th century, that enabled members of the Tribe to select individual allotments, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x938, <i>id.</i>, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343, as a means of encouraging them to depart from the communal lifestyle of the reservation.  See <i>Solem, supra</i>, at 467.  The 1882 Act provided that the United States would convey the land to a member or his heirs in fee simple after holding it in trust on behalf of the member and his heirs for 25 years.  \xc2\xa76,\n\n22Stat.\n342.  Members could select allotments on any part of the reservation, either east or west of the right-of-way.  \xc2\xa78, <i>id.</i>, at 343.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the members selected their allotments\xe2\x80\x94only 10 to 15 of which were located west of the right-of-way\xe2\x80\x94the Secretary proclaimed that the remaining 50,157 acres west of the right-of-way were open for settlement by nonmembers in April 1884.  One of those settlers was W. E. Peebles, who \xe2\x80\x9cpurchased a tract of 160 acres, on which he platted the townsite for Pender.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Parker</i>, 996 F. Supp. 2d 815, 828 (Neb. 2014).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The village of Pender today numbers 1,300 residents.  Most are not associated with the Omaha Tribe.  Less than 2% of Omaha tribal members have lived west of the right-of-way since the early 20th century.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite its longstanding absence, the Tribe sought to assert jurisdiction over Pender in 2006 by subjecting Pender retailers to its newly amended Beverage Control Ordinance.  The ordinance requires those retailers to obtain a liquor license (costing $500, $1,000, or $1,500 depending upon the class of license) and imposes a 10% sales tax on liquor sales.  Nonmembers who violate the ordinance are subject to a $10,000 fine.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The village of Pender and Pender retailers, including bars, a bowling alley, and social clubs, brought a federal suit against members of the Omaha Tribal Council in their official capacities to challenge the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s power to impose the requirements of the Beverage Control Ordinance on nonmembers.  Federal law permits the Tribe to regulate liquor sales on its reservation and in \xe2\x80\x9cIndian country\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s regulations are (as they were here) \xe2\x80\x9ccertified by the Secretary of the Interior, and published in the Federal Register.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71161.  The challengers alleged that they were neither within the boundaries of the Omaha Indian Reservation nor in Indian country and, consequently, were not bound by the ordinance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State of Nebraska intervened on behalf of the plaintiffs, and the United States intervened on behalf of the Omaha Tribal Council members.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s intervention was prompted, in part, by the Omaha Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s demand that Nebraska share with the Tribe revenue that the State received from fuel taxes imposed west of the right-of-way.  In addition to the relief sought by Pender and the Pender retailers, Nebraska sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the Tribe from asserting tribal jurisdiction over the 50,157 acres west of the abandoned right-of-way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After examining the text of the 1882 Act, as well as the contemporaneous and subsequent understanding of the 1882 Act\xe2\x80\x99s effect on the reservation boundaries, the District Court concluded that Congress did not diminish the Omaha Reservation in 1882.  996 F. Supp. 2d, at 844.  Accordingly, the District Court denied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 request for injunctive and declaratory relief barring the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of the Beverage Control Ordinance.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Parker</i>,<i> </i>774 F. 3d 1166, 1168\xe2\x80\x931169 (2014).  We granted certiorari to resolve whether the 1882 Act diminished the Omaha Reservation.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We must determine whether Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished\xe2\x80\x9d the Omaha Indian Reservation in 1882.  If it did so, the State now has jurisdiction over the disputed land.  <i>Solem</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467.  If Congress, on the other hand, did not diminish the reservation and instead only enabled nonmembers to purchase land within the reservation, then federal, state, and tribal authorities share jurisdiction over these \xe2\x80\x9copened\xe2\x80\x9d but undiminished reservation lands.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The framework we employ to determine whether an Indian reservation has been diminished is well settled.  <i>Id.</i>, at 470\xe2\x80\x93472.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly Congress can divest a reservation of its land and diminish its boundaries,\xe2\x80\x9d and its intent to do so must be clear.  <i>Id.</i>, at 470.  To assess whether an Act of Congress diminished a reservation, we start with the statutory text, for \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most probative evidence of diminishment is, of course, the statutory language used to open the Indian lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hagen </i>v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399,\n411 (1994)\n.<i> </i>Under our precedents, we also \xe2\x80\x9cexamine all the circumstances surrounding the opening of a reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 412.  Because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe turn-of-the-century assumption that Indian reservations were a thing of the past,\xe2\x80\x9d many surplus land Acts did not clearly convey \xe2\x80\x9cwhether opened lands retained reservation status or were divested of all Indian interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Solem, supra,</i> at 468.  For that reason, our precedents also look to any \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocal evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of the contemporaneous and subsequent understanding of the status of the reservation by members and nonmembers, as well as the United States and the State of Nebraska.  <i>South Dakota </i>v. <i>Yankton Sioux Tribe</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 329,\n351 (1998)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As with any other question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text of the 1882 Act, the most \xe2\x80\x9cprobative evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of diminishment.  <i>Solem</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 470; see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235,\n241 (1989)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe task of resolving the dispute over the meaning of [a statutory text] begins where all such inqui-ries must begin: with the language of the statute itself\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Common textual indications of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to diminish reservation boundaries include \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xplicit reference to cession or other language evidencing the present and total surrender of all tribal interests\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9can unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate the Indian tribe for its opened land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Solem, supra,</i> at 470.  Such language \xe2\x80\x9cproviding for the total surrender of tribal claims in exchange for a fixed payment\xe2\x80\x9d evinces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to diminish a reservation, <i>Yankton Sioux</i>, <i>supra</i>, at<i> </i>345, and creates \xe2\x80\x9can almost insurmountable presumption that Congress meant for the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s reservation to be diminished,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Solem</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 470\xe2\x80\x93471.  Similarly, a statutory provision restoring portions of a reservation to \xe2\x80\x9cthe public domain\xe2\x80\x9d signifies diminishment.  <i>Hagen, </i>510 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 414.  In the 19th century, to restore land to the public domain was to extinguish the land\xe2\x80\x99s prior use\xe2\x80\x94its use, for example, as an Indian reservation\xe2\x80\x94and to return it to the United States either to be sold or set aside for other public purposes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 412\xe2\x80\x93413.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 1882 Act bore none of these hallmarks of diminishment.  The 1882 Act empowered the Secretary to survey and appraise the disputed land, which then could be purchased in 160-acre tracts by nonmembers.\n\n22Stat.\n341.  The 1882 Act states that the disputed lands would be \xe2\x80\x9copen for settlement under such rules and regulations as [the Secretary of the Interior] may prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  And the parcels would be sold piecemeal in 160-acre tracts.  <i>Ibid.</i>  So rather than the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s receiving a fixed sum for all of the disputed lands, the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s profits were entirely dependent upon how many nonmembers purchased the appraised tracts of land.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">From this text, it is clear that the 1882 Act falls into another category of surplus land Acts: those that \xe2\x80\x9cmerely opened reservation land to settlement and provided that the uncertain future proceeds of settler purchases should be applied to the Indians\xe2\x80\x99 benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>DeCoteau </i>v. <i>District County Court for Tenth Judicial Dist.</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 425\n,448 (1975).  Such schemes allow \xe2\x80\x9cnon-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary</i>,\n\n368 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351,\n356 (1962)\n.  But in doing so, they do not diminish the reservation\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our conclusion that Congress did not intend to diminish the reservation in 1882 is confirmed by the text of earlier treaties between the United States and the Tribe.  See <i>Mattz</i> v. <i>Arnett</i>,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 481,\n504 (1973)\n (comparing statutory text to earlier bills).  In drafting the 1882 Act, Congress legislated against the backdrop of the 1854 and 1865 Treaties\xe2\x80\x94both of which terminated the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over their land \xe2\x80\x9cin unequivocal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Those treaties \xe2\x80\x9cced[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the lands and \xe2\x80\x9creliquish[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d any claims to them in exchange for a fixed sum.\n\n10Stat.\n1043\xe2\x80\x931044; see also\n\n14Stat.\n667 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Omaha tribe of Indians do hereby <i>cede, sell, and convey</i> to the United States a tract of land from the north side of their present reservation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The 1882 Act speaks in much different terms, both in describing the way the individual parcels were to be sold to nonmembers and the way in which the Tribe would profit from those sales.  That 1882 Act also closely tracks the 1872 Act, which petitioners do not contend diminished the reservation.  The change in language in the 1882 Act undermines petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that Congress intended to do the same with the reservation\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries in 1882 as it did in 1854 and 1865.  Petitioners have failed at the first and most important step.  They cannot establish that the text of the 1882 Act evinced an intent to diminish the reservation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now turn to the history surrounding the passage of the 1882 Act.  The mixed historical evidence relied upon by the parties cannot overcome the lack of clear textual signal that Congress intended to diminish the reservation.  That historical evidence in no way \xe2\x80\x9c<i>unequivocally</i> reveal[s] a widely held, contemporaneous understanding that the affected reservation would shrink as a result of the proposed legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Solem</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 471 (emphasis added); see also <i>Exxon Mobil Corp</i>. v. <i>Allapattah Services,</i> <i>Inc.</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 546,\n568 (2005)\n (describing the \xe2\x80\x9coften murky, ambiguous, and contradictory\xe2\x80\x9d nature of extratextual evidence of congressional intent).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners rely largely on isolated statements that some legislators made about the 1882 Act.  Senator Henry Dawes of Massachusetts, for example, noted that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cassured that [the 1882 Act] would <i>leave an ample reservation</i>\xe2\x80\x9d for the Tribe.  13 Cong. Rec. 3032 (1882) (emphasis added).  And Senator John Ingalls of Kansas observed \xe2\x80\x9cthat this bill practically breaks up that portion at least of the reservation which is to be sold, and provides that it shall be disposed of to private purchasers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3028.  Whatever value these contemporaneous floor statements might have, other such statements support the opposite conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that Congress never intended to diminish the reservation.  Senator Charles Jones of Flor-ida, for example, spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite men purchas[ing] titles to land <i>within</i> this reservation and settl[ing] down with the Indians on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 3078 (emphasis added).  Such dueling remarks by individual legislators are far from the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and plain\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of diminishment required under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  <i>Yankton Sioux</i>, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 343 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Solem, </i>465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478 (noting that it was unclear whether statements referring to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reduced reservation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d alluded to the \xe2\x80\x9creduction in Indian-owned lands that would occur once some of the opened lands were sold to settlers or to the reduction that a complete cession of tribal interests in the opened area would precipitate\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More illuminating than cherry-picked statements by individual legislators would be historical evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cthe manner in which the transaction was negotiated\xe2\x80\x9d with the Omaha Tribe.  <i>Id.</i>, at 471.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  In <i>Yankton Sioux</i>, for example, recorded negotiations between the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and leaders of the Yankton Sioux Tribe unambiguously \xe2\x80\x9csignaled [the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s] understanding that the cession of the surplus lands dissolved tribal governance of the 1858 reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353.  No such unambiguous evidence exists in the record of these negotiations.  In particular, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the remarks of Representative Edward Valentine of Nebraska, who stated, \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot find one of those Indians that does not want the western portion sold,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Tribe wished to sell the land to those who would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reside upon it and cultivate it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d so that the Tribe members could \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit of these improvements,\xe2\x80\x9d 13 Cong. Rec. 6541,<i> </i>falls short.  Nothing about this statement or other similar statements unequivocally supports a finding that the existing boundaries of the reservation would be diminished.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, we consider both the subsequent demographic history of opened lands, which serves as \xe2\x80\x9cone additional clue as to what Congress expected would happen once land on a particular reservation was opened to non-Indian settlers,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Solem</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 472, as well as the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment of the affected areas, particularly in the years immediately following the opening,\xe2\x80\x9d which has \xe2\x80\x9csome evidentiary value,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 471.  Our cases suggest that such evidence might \xe2\x80\x9creinforc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d a finding of diminishment or nondiminishment based on the text.  <i>Mattz</i>, 412 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 505; see also, <i>e.g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe </i>v. <i>Kneip</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 584\n\xe2\x80\x93605 (1977) (invoking subsequent history to reject a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrained\xe2\x80\x9d textual reading of a congressional Act).  But this Court has never relied solely on this third consideration to find diminishment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As petitioners have discussed at length, the Tribe was almost entirely absent from the disputed territory for more than 120 years.  Brief for Petitioners 24\xe2\x80\x9330.  The Omaha Tribe does not enforce any of its regulations\xe2\x80\x94including those governing businesses, fire protection, animal control, fireworks, and wildlife and parks\xe2\x80\x94in Pender or in other locales west of the right-of-way.  996 F.

Nor does it maintain an office, provide social services, or host tribal celebrations or ceremonies west of the right-of-way.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This subsequent demographic history cannot overcome our conclusion that Congress did not intend to diminish the reservation in 1882.  And it is not our role to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite\xe2\x80\x9d the 1882 Act in light of this subsequent demographic history.  <i>DeCoteau</i>, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 447.<i> </i> After all, evidence of the changing demographics of disputed land is \xe2\x80\x9cthe least compelling\xe2\x80\x9d evidence in our diminishment analysis, for \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very surplus land Act necessarily resulted in a surge of non-Indian settlement and degraded the \xe2\x80\x98Indian character\xe2\x80\x99 of the reservation, yet we have repeatedly stated that not every surplus land Act diminished the affected reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yankton Sioux</i>, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 356<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Evidence of the subsequent treatment of the disputed land by Government officials likewise has \xe2\x80\x9climited interpretive value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 355.  Petitioners highlight that, for more than a century and with few exceptions, reports from the Office of Indian Affairs and in opinion letters from Government officials treated the disputed land as Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s.  Brief for Petitioners 24\xe2\x80\x9338; see also 996 F. Supp. 2d, at 828, 830.  It was not until this litigation commenced that the Department of the Interior definitively changed its position, concluding that the reservation boundaries were in fact not diminished in 1882.  See <i>id.</i>, at 830\xe2\x80\x93831.

This \xe2\x80\x9cmixed record\xe2\x80\x9d of subsequent treatment of the disputed land cannot overcome the statutory text, which is devoid of any language indicative of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to diminish.  <i>Yankton Sioux</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 356.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about upsetting the \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiable expectations\xe2\x80\x9d of the almost exclusively non-Indian settlers who live on the land are compelling, <i>Rosebud Sioux</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 605, but these expectations alone, resulting from the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s failure to assert jurisdiction, cannot diminish reservation boundaries.  Only Congress has the power to diminish a reservation.  <i>DeCoteau</i>, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 449.  And though petitioners wish that Congress would have \xe2\x80\x9cspoken differently\xe2\x80\x9d in 1882, \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot remake history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In light of the statutory text, we hold that the 1882 Act did not diminish the Omaha Indian Reservation.  Because petitioners have raised only the single question of diminishment,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] we express no view about whether equitable considerations of laches and acquiescence may curtail the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax the retailers of Pender in light of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s century-long absence from the disputed lands.
