Mr. Oliveira works under an operating agreement that calls him an independent contractor and contains a mandatory arbitration provision.  When Mr. Oliveira filed a class action alleging that New Prime denies its drivers lawful wages, New Prime asked the court to invoke its statutory authority under the Federal Arbitration Act to compel arbitration.  Mr. Oliveira countered that the court lacked authority because \xc2\xa71 of the Act excepts from coverage disputes involving \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d of certain transportation workers.  New Prime insisted that any question regarding \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s applicability belonged to the arbitrator alone to resolve, or, assuming the court could address the question, that \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d referred only to contracts that establish an employer-employee relationship and not to contracts with independent contractors.  The District Court and First Circuit agreed with Mr. Oliveira.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0A court should determine whether a \xc2\xa71 exclusion applies before ordering arbitration.  A court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to compel arbitration under the Act does not extend to all private contracts, no matter how emphatically they may express a preference for arbitration.  Instead, antecedent statutory provisions limit the scope of a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 powers to stay litigation and compel arbitration \xe2\x80\x9caccord[ing to] the terms\xe2\x80\x9d of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  Section 2 provides that the Act applies only when the agreement is set forth as \xe2\x80\x9ca written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa71 helps define \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s terms, warning, as relevant here, that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  For a court to invoke its statutory authority under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4, it must first know if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement is excluded from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage by the terms of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2.  This sequencing is significant.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bernhardt</i> v. <i>Polygraphic Co. of America</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/350/198/">350 U.S. 198</a>, 201\xe2\x80\x93202.  New Prime notes that the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract contains a \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation clause,\xe2\x80\x9d giving the arbitrator authority to decide threshold questions of arbitrability, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cseverability principle\xe2\x80\x9d requires that both sides take all their disputes to arbitration.  But a delegation clause is merely a specialized type of arbitration agreement and is enforceable under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 only if it appears in a contract consistent with \xc2\xa72 that does not trigger \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception.  And, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s severability principle applies only if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement appears in a contract that falls within the field \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 describe.

S. ___, ___ (quoting <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/37/">444 U.S. 37</a>, 42).  After all, if judges could freely invest old statutory terms with new meanings, this Court would risk amending legislation outside the \xe2\x80\x9csingle, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution commands.  <i>INS</i> v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/462/919/">462 U.S. 919</a>, 951.  The Court would risk, too, upsetting reliance interests by subjecting people today to different rules than they enjoyed when the statute was passed.  At the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s adoption in 1925, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d was not a term of art, and dictionaries tended to treat \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d more or less as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cwork.\xe2\x80\x9d  Contemporaneous legal authorities provide no evidence that a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily signaled a formal employer-employee relationship.  Evidence that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d broadly can be found in its choice of the neighboring term \xe2\x80\x9cworkers,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that easily embraces independent contractors.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0New Prime argues that by 1925, the words \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contractor\xe2\x80\x9d had already assumed distinct meanings.  But while the words \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d may share a common root and intertwined history, they also developed at different times and in at least some different ways.  The evidence remains that, as dominantly understood in 1925, a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d did not necessarily imply the existence of an employer-employee relationship.  New Prime\xe2\x80\x99s argument that early 20th-century courts sometimes used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d to describe what are recognized today as agreements between employers and employees does nothing to negate the possibility that the term also embraced agreements by independent contractors to perform work.  And its effort to explain away the statute\xe2\x80\x99s suggestive use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cworker\xe2\x80\x9d by noting that the neighboring terms \xe2\x80\x9cseamen\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees\xe2\x80\x9d included only employees in 1925 rests on a precarious premise.  The evidence suggests that even \xe2\x80\x9cseamen\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees\xe2\x80\x9d could be independent contractors at the time the Arbitration Act passed.  Left to appeal to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s policy, New Prime suggests that this Court order arbitration to abide Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to counteract judicial hostility to arbitration and establish a favorable federal policy toward arbitration agreements.  Courts, however, are not free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal.  Rather, the Court should respect \xe2\x80\x9cthe limits up to which Congress was prepared\xe2\x80\x9d to go when adopting the Arbitration Act.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sisson</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/399/267/">399 U.S. 267</a>, 298.  This Court also declines to address New Prime\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that it order arbitration anyway under its inherent authority to stay litigation in favor of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 choosing.

But like most laws, this one bears its qualifications.  Among other things, \xc2\xa71 says that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing herein\xe2\x80\x9d may be used to compel arbitration in disputes involving the \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d of certain transportation workers.\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  And that qualification has sparked these questions: When a contract delegates questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator, must a court leave disputes over the application of \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception for the arbitrator to resolve?  And does the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d refer only to contracts between employers and employees, or does it also reach contracts with independent contractors?  Because courts across the country have disagreed on the answers to these questions, we took this case to resolve them.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">New Prime is an interstate trucking company and Dominic Oliveira works as one of its drivers.  But, at least on paper, Mr. Oliveira isn\xe2\x80\x99t an employee; the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contracts label him an independent contractor.  Those agreements also instruct that any disputes arising out of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 relationship should be resolved by an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x94even disputes over the scope of the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Eventually, of course, a dispute did arise.  In a class action lawsuit in federal court, Mr. Oliveira argued that New Prime denies its drivers lawful wages.  The company may call its drivers independent contractors.  But, Mr. Oliveira alleged, in reality New Prime treats them as employees and fails to pay the statutorily due minimum wage.  In response to Mr. Oliveira\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, New Prime asked the court to invoke its statutory authority under the Act and compel arbitration according to the terms found in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That request led to more than a little litigation of its own.  Even when the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contracts mandate arbitration, Mr. Oliveira observed, the Act doesn\xe2\x80\x99t <i>always</i> authorize a court to enter an order compelling it.  In particular, \xc2\xa71 carves out from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  And at least for purposes of this collateral dispute, Mr. Oliveira submitted, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether you view him as an employee or independent contractor.  Either way, his agreement to drive trucks for New Prime qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract[\xc2\xa0] of employment of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [a] worker[\xc2\xa0] engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, Mr. Oliveira argued, the Act supplied the district court with no authority to compel arbitration in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Naturally, New Prime disagreed.  Given the extraordinary breadth of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement, the company insisted that any question about \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s application belonged for the arbitrator alone to resolve.  Alternatively and assuming a court could address the question, New Prime contended that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to contracts that establish an employer-employee relationship.  And because Mr. Oliveira is, in fact as well as form, an independent contractor, the company argued, \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply; the rest of the statute does; and the district court was (once again) required to order arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, the district court and the First Circuit sided with Mr. Oliveira.  857 F.3d 7 (2017).  The court of appeals held, first, that in disputes like this a court should resolve whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract falls within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s ambit or \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion before invoking the statute\xe2\x80\x99s authority to order arbitration.  Second, the court of appeals held that \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of certain \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d removes from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage not only employer-employee contracts but also contracts involving independent contractors.  So under any account of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement in this case, the court held, it lacked authority under the Act to order arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In approaching the first question for ourselves, one thing becomes clear immediately.  While a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the Arbitration Act to compel arbitration may be considerable, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t unconditional.  If two parties agree to arbitrate future disputes between them and one side later seeks to evade the deal, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 of the Act often require a court to stay litigation and compel arbitration  \xe2\x80\x9caccord[ing to] the terms\xe2\x80\x9d of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  But this authority doesn\xe2\x80\x99t extend to <i>all</i> private contracts, no matter how emphatically they may express a preference for arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, antecedent statutory provisions limit the scope of the court\xe2\x80\x99s powers under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4.  Section 2 provides that the Act applies only when the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate is set forth as a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa71 helps define \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  Most relevant for our purposes, \xc2\xa71 warns that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Why this very particular qualification?  By the time it adopted the Arbitration Act in 1925, Congress had already prescribed alternative employment dispute resolution regimes for many transportation workers.  And it seems Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdid not wish to unsettle\xe2\x80\x9d those arrangements in favor of whatever arbitration procedures the parties\xe2\x80\x99 private contracts might happen to contemplate.  <i>Circuit City Stores</i>,<i> Inc.</i> v. <i>Adams</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/532/105/">532 U.S. 105</a>, 121 (2001).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms and sequencing, we agree with the First Circuit that a court should decide for itself whether \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d exclusion applies before ordering arbitration.  After all, to invoke its statutory powers under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 to stay litigation and compel arbitration according to a contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms, a court must first know whether the contract itself falls within or beyond the boundaries of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 private agreement may be crystal clear and require arbitration of every question under the sun, but that does not necessarily mean the Act authorizes a court to stay litigation and send the parties to an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in our holding on this score should come as a surprise.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve long stressed the significance of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s sequencing.  In <i>Bernhardt</i> v. <i>Polygraphic Co. of America</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/350/198/">350 U.S. 198</a>, 201\xe2\x80\x93202 (1956), we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cSections 1, 2, and 3 [and 4] are integral parts of a whole.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [Sections] 1 and 2 define the field in which Congress was legislating,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 apply only to contracts covered by those provisions.  In <i>Circuit City</i>, we acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 1 exempts from the [Act] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. contracts of employment of transportation workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 119.  And in <i>Southland Corp.</i> v. <i>Keating</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/465/1/">465 U.S. 1</a>, 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa05 (1984),<b> </b>we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe enforceability of arbitration provisions\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 depends on whether those provisions are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of a written maritime contract or a contract \xe2\x80\x98evidencing a transaction involving commerce\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x94which, in turn, depends on the application of \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception for certain \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, New Prime resists this straightforward understanding.  The company argues that an arbitrator should resolve any dispute over \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s application because of the \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation clause\xe2\x80\x9d in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract and what is sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9cseverability principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  A delegation clause gives an arbitrator authority to decide even the initial question whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute is subject to arbitration.  <i>Rent-A-Center</i>,<i> West</i>,<i> Inc.</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/561/63/">561 U.S. 63</a>, 68\xe2\x80\x9369 (2010).  And under the severability principle, we treat a challenge to the validity of an arbitration agreement (or a delegation clause) separately from a challenge to the validity of the entire contract in which it appears.  <i>Id.</i>, at 70\xe2\x80\x9371.  Unless a party specifically challenges the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, both sides may be required to take all their disputes\xe2\x80\x94including disputes about the validity of their broader contract\xe2\x80\x94to arbitration.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Applying these principles to this case, New Prime notes that Mr. Oliveira has not specifically challenged the parties\xe2\x80\x99 delegation clause and submits that any controversy should therefore proceed only and immediately before an arbitrator.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But all this overlooks the necessarily antecedent statutory inquiry we\xe2\x80\x99ve just discussed.  A delegation clause is merely a specialized type of arbitration agreement, and the Act \xe2\x80\x9coperates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 70.  So a court may use \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4 to enforce a delegation clause only if the clause appears in a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\xe2\x80\x9d consistent with \xc2\xa72.  And only if the contract in which the clause appears doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trigger \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  In exactly the same way, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s severability principle applies only if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement appears in a contract that falls within the field \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 describe.  We acknowledged as much some time ago, explaining that, before invoking the severability principle, a court should \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine[\xc2\xa0] that the contract in question is within the coverage of the Arbitration Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Prima Paint Corp.</i> v. <i>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/395/">388 U.S. 395</a>, 402 (1967).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">That takes us to the second question: Did the First Circuit correctly resolve the merits of the \xc2\xa71 challenge in this case?  Recall that \xc2\xa71 excludes from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s compass \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. workers engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Happily, everyone before us agrees that Mr. Oliveira qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cworker[\xc2\xa0] engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  For purposes of this appeal, too, Mr. Oliveira is willing to assume (but not grant) that his contracts with New Prime establish only an independent contractor relationship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With that, the disputed question comes into clear view: What does the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d mean?  If it refers only to contracts that reflect an employer-employee relationship, then \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception is irrelevant and a court is free to order arbitration, just as New Prime urges.  But if the term <i>also </i>encompasses contracts that require an independent contractor to perform work, then the exception takes hold and a court lacks authority under the Act to order arbitration, exactly as Mr. Oliveira argues.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In taking up this question, we bear an important caution in mind.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x98fundamental canon of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x99 that words generally should be \xe2\x80\x98interpreted as taking their ordinary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the time Congress enacted the statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wisconsin Central Ltd. </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 585 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9) (quoting <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/37/">444 U.S. 37</a>, 42 (1979)).  See also <i>Sandifer </i>v.<i> United States Steel Corp.</i>,\n\n571 U.S. 220, 227 (2014).  After all, if judges could freely invest old statutory terms with new meanings, we would risk amending legislation outside the \xe2\x80\x9csingle, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution commands.  <i>INS</i> v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/462/919/">462 U.S. 919</a>, 951 (1983).  We would risk, too, upsetting reliance interests in the settled meaning of a statute.  Cf.<i> </i>2B N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa756A:3 (rev. 7th ed. 2012).  Of course, statutes may sometimes refer to an external source of law and fairly warn readers that they must abide that external source of law, later amendments and modifications included.  <i>Id</i>., \xc2\xa751:8 (discussing the reference canon).  But nothing like that exists here.  Nor has anyone suggested any other appropriate reason that might allow us to depart from the original meaning of the statute at hand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That, we think, holds the key to the case.  To many lawyerly ears today, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d might call to mind only agreements between employers and employees (or what the common law sometimes called masters and servants).  Suggestively, at least one recently published law dictionary defines the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe relationship between master and servant.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 641 (10th ed. 2014).  But this modern intuition isn\xe2\x80\x99t easily squared with evidence of the term\xe2\x80\x99s meaning at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s adoption in 1925.  At that time, a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d usually meant nothing more than an agreement to perform work.  As a result, most people then would have understood \xc2\xa71 to exclude not only agreements between employers and employees but also agreements that require independent contractors to perform work.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What\xe2\x80\x99s the evidence to support this conclusion?  It turns out that in 1925 the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t defined in any of the (many) popular or legal dictionaries the parties cite to us.  And surely that\xe2\x80\x99s a first hint the phrase wasn\xe2\x80\x99t then a term of art bearing some specialized meaning.  It turns out, too, that the dictionaries of the era consistently afforded the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d a broad construction, broader than may be often found in dictionaries today.  Back then, dictionaries tended to treat \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d more or less as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cwork.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor did they distinguish between different kinds of work or workers: All work was treated as employment, whether or not the common law criteria for a master-servant relationship happened to be satisfied.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What the dictionaries suggest, legal authorities confirm.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s early 20th-century cases used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d to describe work agreements involving independent contractors.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Many state court cases did the same.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  So did a variety of federal statutes.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  And state statutes too.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  We see here no evidence that a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract of employment\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily signaled a formal employer-employee or master-servant relationship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More confirmation yet comes from a neighboring term in the statutory text.  Recall that the Act excludes from its coverage \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. class of <i>workers</i> engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 (emphasis added).  Notice Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cservants,\xe2\x80\x9d the natural choices if the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d addressed them alone.  Instead, Congress spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cworkers,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that everyone agrees easily embraces independent contractors.  That word choice may not mean everything, but it does supply further evidence still that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d in a broad sense to capture any contract for the performance of <i>work</i> by <i>workers</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">What does New Prime have to say about the case building against it?  Mainly, it seeks to shift the debate from the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d to the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Today, the company emphasizes, the law often distinguishes between employees and independent contractors.  Employees are generally understood as those who work \xe2\x80\x9cin the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work perform- ance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, at 639.  Meanwhile, independent contractors are sometimes described as those \xe2\x80\x9centrusted to undertake a specific project but who [are] left free to do the assigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 888.<i> </i>New Prime argues that, by 1925, the words \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contractor\xe2\x80\x9d had already assumed these distinct meanings.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  And given that, the company contends, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of <i>employment</i>\xe2\x80\x9d should be understood to refer only to relationships between <i>employers and employees</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unsurprisingly, Mr. Oliveira disagrees.  He replies that, while the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d dates back many centuries, the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d only made its first appearance in English in the 1800s.  See Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., Mar. 2014), www.oed.com/view/Entry/61374 (all Internet materials as last visited Jan. 9, 2019).  At that time, the word from which it derived, \xe2\x80\x9cemploy,\xe2\x80\x9d simply meant to \xe2\x80\x9capply (a thing) to some definite purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 J. Murray, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 129 (1891).  And even in 1910, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary reported that the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d had only \xe2\x80\x9cbecome somewhat naturalized in our language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 421 (2d ed. 1910).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Still, the parties do share some common ground.  They agree that the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d eventually came into wide circulation and came to denote those who work for a wage at the direction of another.  They agree, too, that all this came to pass in part because the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer from the same \xe2\x80\x9chistorical baggage\xe2\x80\x9d of the older common law term \xe2\x80\x9cservant,\xe2\x80\x9d and because it proved useful when drafting legislation to regulate burgeoning industries and their labor forces in the early 20th century.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  The parties even agree that the development of the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d may have come to influence and narrow our understanding of the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d in comparatively recent years and may be why today it might signify to some a \xe2\x80\x9crelationship between master and servant.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 extended etymological debate persuades us of anything, it is that care is called for.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployment\xe2\x80\x9d may share a common root and an intertwined history.  But they also developed at different times and in at least some different ways.  The only question in this case concerns the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of <i>employment</i>\xe2\x80\x9d in 1925.  And, whatever the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d may have meant at that time, and however it may have later influenced the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cemployment,\xe2\x80\x9d the evidence before us remains that, as dominantly understood in 1925, a contract of <i>employment</i> did not necessarily imply the existence of an employer-employee or master-servant relationship.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When New Prime finally turns its attention to the term in dispute, it directs us to <i>Coppage </i>v. <i>Kansas</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/236/1/">236 U.S. 1</a>, 13 (1915).  There and in other cases like it, New Prime notes, courts sometimes used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d to describe what today we\xe2\x80\x99d recognize as agreements between employers and employees.  But this proves little.  No one doubts that employer-employee agreements to perform work qualified as \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d in 1925\xe2\x80\x94and documenting that fact does nothing to negate the possibility that \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d <i>also </i>embraced agreements by independent contractors to perform work.  Coming a bit closer to  the mark, New Prime eventually cites a handful of early 20th-century legal materials that seem to use the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d to refer <i>exclusively</i> to employer-employee agreements.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  But from the record amassed before us, these authorities appear to represent at most the vanguard, not the main body, of contemporaneous usage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">New Prime\xe2\x80\x99s effort to explain away the statute\xe2\x80\x99s suggestive use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cworker\xe2\x80\x9d proves no more compelling.  The company reminds us that the statute excludes \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cseamen\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees\xe2\x80\x9d as well as other transportation workers.  And because \xe2\x80\x9cseamen\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees\xe2\x80\x9d included <i>only</i> employees in 1925, the company reasons, we should understand \xe2\x80\x9cany other class of workers engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to bear a similar construction.  But this argument rests on a precarious premise.  At the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage, shipboard surgeons who tended injured sailors were considered \xe2\x80\x9cseamen\xe2\x80\x9d though they likely served in an independent contractor capacity.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  Even the term \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees\xe2\x80\x9d may have swept more broadly at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage than might seem obvious today.  In 1922, for example, the Railroad Labor Board interpreted the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d in the Transportation Act of 1920 to refer to anyone \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in the customary work directly contributory to the operation of the railroads.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  And the Erdman Act, a statute enacted to address disruptive railroad strikes at the end of the 19th century, seems to evince an equally broad understanding of \xe2\x80\x9crailroad employees.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unable to squeeze more from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, New Prime is left to appeal to its policy.  This Court has said that Congress adopted the Arbitration Act in an effort to counteract judicial hostility to arbitration and establish \xe2\x80\x9ca liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </i>v. <i>Mercury Constr. Corp.</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/460/1/">460 U.S. 1</a>, 24 (1983).  To abide that policy, New Prime suggests, we must order arbitration according to the terms of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement.  But often and by design it is \xe2\x80\x9chard-fought compromise[\xc2\xa0],\xe2\x80\x9d not cold logic, that supplies the solvent needed for a bill to survive the legislative process.  <i>Board of Governors</i>,<i> FRS</i> v. <i>Dimension Financial Corp.</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/474/361/">474 U.S. 361</a>, 374 (1986).  If courts felt free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal, we would risk failing to \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. account of\xe2\x80\x9d legislative compromises essential to a law\xe2\x80\x99s passage and, in that way, thwart rather than honor \xe2\x80\x9cthe effectuation of congressional intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  By respecting the qualifications of \xc2\xa71 today, we \xe2\x80\x9crespect the limits up to which Congress was prepared\xe2\x80\x9d to go when adopting the Arbitration Act.  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Sisson</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/399/267/">399 U.S. 267</a>, 298 (1970).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, and stretching in a different direction entirely, New Prime invites us to look beyond the Act.  Even if the statute doesn\xe2\x80\x99t supply judges with the power to compel arbitration in this case, the company says we should order it anyway because courts always enjoy the inherent authority to stay litigation in favor of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 choosing.  That, though, is an argument we decline to tangle with.  The courts below did not address it and we granted certiorari only to resolve existing confusion about the application of the Arbitration Act, not to explore other potential avenues for reaching a destination it does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When Congress enacted the Arbitration Act in 1925, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts of employment\xe2\x80\x9d referred to agreements to perform work.  No less than those who came before him, Mr. Oliveira is entitled to the benefit of that same understanding today.  Accordingly, his agreement with New Prime falls within \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s exception, the court of appeals was correct that it lacked authority under the Act to order arbitration, and the judgment is</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">Affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0See, <i>e.g.</i>, 3 J.
