McCottry did not testify at Davis\xe2\x80\x99s trial for felony violation of a domestic no-contact order, but the court admitted the 911 recording despite Davis\xe2\x80\x99s objection, which he based on the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.  He was convicted.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the State Supreme Court, which concluded that, <em>inter alia,</em> the portion of the 911 conversation in which McCottry identified Davis as her assailant was not testimonial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705, when police responded to a reported domestic disturbance at the home of Amy and Hershel Hammon, Amy told them that nothing was wrong, but gave them permission to enter.  Once inside, one officer kept petitioner Hershel in the kitchen while the other interviewed Amy elsewhere and had her complete and sign a battery affidavit.  Amy did not appear at Hershel\xe2\x80\x99s bench trial for, <em>inter alia,</em> domestic battery, but her affidavit and testimony from the officer who questioned her were admitted over Hershel\xe2\x80\x99s objection that he had no opportunity to cross-examine her.  Hershel was convicted, and the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part.  The State Supreme Court also affirmed, concluding that, although Amy\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit was testimonial and wrongly admitted, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Confrontation Clause bars \xe2\x80\x9cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  These cases require the Court to determine which police \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogations\xe2\x80\x9d produce statements that fall within this prohibition.  Without attempting to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements as either testimonial or nontestimonial, it suffices to decide the present cases to hold that statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.

Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This case requires the Court to decide whether the Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay, and, if so, whether the 911 recording qualifies.  <em>Crawford </em>suggested the answer to the first question, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Confrontation Clause \xe2\x80\xa6 applies to \xe2\x80\x98witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 against the accused\xe2\x80\x94in other words, those who \xe2\x80\x98bear testimony.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Only \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial statements\xe2\x80\x9d cause a declarant to be a witness.  The Court is unaware of any early American case invoking the Confrontation Clause or the common-law right to confrontation that did not involve testimony as thus defined.  Well into the 20th century, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence was carefully applied only in the testimonial context, and its later cases never in practice dispensed with the Confrontation Clause requirements of unavailability and prior cross-examination in cases involving testimonial hearsay.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The question in <em>Davis</em>, therefore,<em> </em>is whether, objectively considered, the interrogation during the 911 call<em> </em>produced testimonial statements.  In contrast to <em>Crawford</em>, where the interrogation took place at a police station and was directed solely at establishing a past crime, a 911 call is ordinarily designed primarily to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.  The difference is apparent here.  McCottry was speaking of events as they were actually happening, while Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation took place hours after the events occurred.  Moreover, McCottry was facing an ongoing emergency.  Further, the statements elicited were necessary to enable the police to resolve the present emergency rather than simply to learn what had happened in the past.  Finally, the difference in the level of formality is striking.  Crawford calmly answered questions at a station house, with an officer-interrogator taping and taking notes, while McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even safe.  Thus, the circumstances of her interrogation objectively indicate that its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  She was not acting as a witness or testifying.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Amy Hammon\xe2\x80\x99s statements were testimonial.  They were not much different from those in <em>Crawford.  </em>It is clear from the circumstances that Amy\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct.  There was no emergency in progress, she told the police when they arrived that things were fine, and the officer questioning her was seeking to determine not what was happening but what had happened.  Objectively viewed, the primary, if not sole, purpose of the investigation was to investigate a possible crime.  While the formal features of Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation strengthened her statements\xe2\x80\x99 testimonial aspect, such features were not essential to the point.  In both cases, the declarants were separated from the defendants, the statements recounted how potentially criminal past events began and progressed, and the interrogation took place some time after the events were over.  For the same reasons the comparison to <em>Crawford </em>is compelling, the comparison to <em>Davis</em> is unpersuasive.  The statements in <em>Davis </em>were taken when McCottry was alone, unprotected by police, and apparently in immediate danger from Davis.  She was seeking aid, not telling a story about the past.

Absent such a finding, the Sixth Amendment operates to exclude Amy Hammon\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit.

McCottry started talking, but the operator cut her off, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStop talking and answer my questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.  She then gathered more information about Davis (including his birthday), and learned that Davis had told McCottry that his purpose in coming to the house was \xe2\x80\x9cto get his stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d since McCottry was moving.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  McCottry described the context of the assault, <em>id.</em>, at 12, after which the operator told her that the police were on their way.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re gonna check the area for him first,\xe2\x80\x9d the operator said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna come talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The police arrived within four minutes of the 911 call and observed McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s shaken state, the \xe2\x80\x9cfresh injuries on her forearm and her face,\xe2\x80\x9d and her \xe2\x80\x9cfrantic efforts to gather her belongings and her children so that they could leave the residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  154 Wash. 2d 291, 296, 111 P.\xc2\xa03d 844, 847 (2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State charged Davis with felony violation of a domestic no-contact order.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe State\xe2\x80\x99s only witnesses were the two police officers who responded to the 911 call.  Both officers testified that McCottry exhibited injuries that appeared to be recent, but neither officer could testify as to the cause of the injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  McCottry presumably could have testified as to whether Davis was her assailant, but she did not appear.  Over Davis\xe2\x80\x99s objection, based on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, the trial court admitted the recording of her exchange with the 911 operator, and the jury convicted him.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, 116 Wash. App. 81, 64 P.\xc2\xa03d 661 (2003).  The Supreme Court of Washington, with one dissenting justice, also affirmed, concluding that the portion of the 911 conversation in which McCottry identified Davis was not testimonial, and that if other portions of the conversation were testimonial, admitting them was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  154 Wash. 2d, at 305, 111 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 851.

By this point Amy had come back inside.

Hershel made several attempts to participate in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with the police, see <em>id.</em>, at 32, but was rebuffed.  The officer later testified that Hershel \xe2\x80\x9cbecame angry when I insisted that [he] stay separated from Mrs. Hammon so that we can investigate what had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34.  After hearing Amy\xe2\x80\x99s account, the officer \xe2\x80\x9chad her fill out and sign a battery affidavit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 18.  Amy handwrote the following: \xe2\x80\x9cBroke our Furnace &amp; shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass.  Hit me in the chest and threw me down.  Broke our lamps &amp; phone.  Tore up my van where I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the house.  Attacked my daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State charged Hershel with domestic battery and with violating his probation.  Amy was subpoenaed, but she did not appear at his subsequent bench trial.  The State called the officer who had questioned Amy, and asked him to recount what Amy told him and to authenticate the affidavit.  Hershel\xe2\x80\x99s counsel repeatedly objected to the admission of this evidence.  See <em>id.</em>, at 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21.  At one point, after hearing the prosecutor defend the affidavit because it was made \xe2\x80\x9cunder oath,\xe2\x80\x9d defense counsel said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give us the opportunity to cross examine [the] person who allegedly drafted it.  Makes me mad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 19.  Nonetheless, the trial court admitted the affidavit as a \xe2\x80\x9cpresent sense impression,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 20, and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s statements as \xe2\x80\x9cexcited utterances\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9care expressly permitted in these kinds of cases even if the declarant is not available to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 40.  The officer thus testified that Amy</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cinformed me that she and Hershel had been in an argument.

They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p>\n\nA</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Crawford</em>,<em> </em>it sufficed for resolution of the case before us to determine that \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 53.

The inquiries of a police operator in the course of a 911 call[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] are an interrogation in one sense, but not in a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cqualifies under any conceivable definition.\xe2\x80\x9d  We must decide, therefore, whether the Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay; and, if so, whether the recording of a 911 call qualifies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer to the first question was suggested in <em>Crawford, </em>even if not explicitly held:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe text of the Confrontation Clause reflects this focus [on testimonial hearsay].

S. 56</a> (1980),[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] never in practice dispensed with the Confrontation Clause requirements of unavailability and prior cross-examination in cases that involved testimonial hearsay, see <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U. S., at 57\xe2\x80\x9359 (citing cases), with one arguable exception, see <em>id.</em>, at 58, n.\xc2\xa08 (discussing <em>White</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/346/index.html">502 U. S. 346</a> (1992)).  Where our cases did dispense with those requirements\xe2\x80\x94even under the <em>Roberts </em>approach\xe2\x80\x94the statements at issue were clearly nontestimonial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bourjaily</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/171/index.html">483 U. S. 171</a>, 181\xe2\x80\x93184 (1987) (statements made unwittingly to a Government informant); <em>Dutton</em> v. <em>Evans,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/74/index.html">400 U. S. 74</a>, 87\xe2\x80\x9389 (1970) (plurality opinion) (statements from one prisoner to another).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the American cases applying the Confrontation Clause or its state constitutional or common-law counterparts involved testimonial statements of the most formal sort\xe2\x80\x94sworn testimony in prior judicial proceedings or formal depositions under oath\xe2\x80\x94which invites the argument that the scope of the Clause is limited to that very formal category.  But the English cases that were the progenitors of the Confrontation Clause did not limit the exclusionary rule to prior court testimony and formal depositions, see <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 52, and n.\xc2\xa03.  In any event, we do not think it conceivable that the protections of the Confrontation Clause can readily be evaded by having a note-taking policeman <em>recite </em>the unsworn hearsay testimony of the declarant, instead of having the declarant sign a deposition.  Indeed, if there is one point for which no case\xe2\x80\x94English or early American, state or federal\xe2\x80\x94can be cited, that is it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us in <em>Davis</em>, then, is whether, objectively considered, the interrogation that took place in the course of the 911 call produced testimonial statements.  When we said in <em>Crawford</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 53, that \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within [the] class\xe2\x80\x9d of testimonial hearsay, we had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us) interrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator.  The product of such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial.  It is, in the terms of the 1828 American dictionary quoted in <em>Crawford, </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 51. (The solemnity of even an oral declaration of relevant past fact to an investigating officer is well enough established by the severe consequences that can attend a deliberate falsehood.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stewart</em>, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 273, 288 (CA2 2006) (false statements made to federal investigators violate 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed</em>, 2005 WI 53, \xc2\xb630, 695 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 315, 323 (state criminal offense to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly giv[e] false information to [an] officer with [the] intent to mislead the officer in the performance of his or her duty\xe2\x80\x9d).)  A 911 call, on the other hand, and at least the initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911 call, is ordinarily not designed primarily to \xe2\x80\x9cestablis[h] or prov[e]\xe2\x80\x9d some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difference between the interrogation in <em>Davis </em>and the one in <em>Crawford </em>is apparent on the face of things.  In <em>Davis, </em>McCottry was speaking about events <em>as they were actually happening</em>, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdescrib[ing] past events,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lilly</em> v. <em>Virginia, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/116/index.html">527 U. S. 116</a>, 137 (1999) (plurality opinion).  Sylvia Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation, on the other hand, took place hours after the events she described had occurred.  Moreover, any reasonable listener would recognize that McCottry (unlike Sylvia Crawford) was facing an ongoing emergency.  Although one <em>might</em> call 911 to provide a narrative report of a crime absent any imminent danger, McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s call was plainly a call for help against bona fide<em> </em>physical threat.  Third, the nature of what was asked and answered in <em>Davis</em>, again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford</em>) what had happened in the past.  That is true even of the operator\xe2\x80\x99s effort to establish the identity of the assailant, so that the dispatched officers might know whether they would be encountering a violent felon.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hiibel </em>v.<em> Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/177/index.html">542 U. S. 177</a>, 186 (2004).  And finally, the difference in the level of formality between the two interviews is striking.  Crawford was responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questions, with the officer-interrogator taping and making notes of her answers;  McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude from all this that the circumstances of McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation objectively indicate its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  She simply was not acting as a <em>witness;</em> she was not <em>testifying</em>.  What she said was not \xe2\x80\x9ca weaker substitute for live testimony\xe2\x80\x9d at trial, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Inadi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/387/index.html">475 U. S. 387</a>, 394 (1986), like Lord Cobham\xe2\x80\x99s statements in <em>Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603), or Jane Dingler\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ex parte </em>statements against her husband in <em>King </em>v. <em>Dingler</em>, 2 Leach 561, 168 Eng. Rep. 383 (1791), or Sylvia Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s statement in <em>Crawford</em>.  In each of those cases, the <em>ex parte </em>actors and the evidentiary products of the <em>ex parte </em>communication aligned perfectly with their courtroom analogues.  McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s emergency statement does not.  No \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis seeks to cast McCottry in the unlikely role of a witness by pointing to English cases.  None of them involves statements made during an ongoing emergency.  In <em>King </em>v. <em>Brasier</em>, 1 Leach 199, 168 Eng. Rep. 202 (1779), for example, a young rape victim, \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately on her coming home, told all the circumstances of the injury\xe2\x80\x9d to her mother.  <em>Id.</em>, at 200, 168 Eng. Rep., at 202.  The case would be helpful to Davis if the relevant statement had been the girl\xe2\x80\x99s screams for aid as she was being chased by her assailant.  But by the time the victim got home, her story was an account of past events.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that a conversation which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance cannot, as the Indiana Supreme Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cevolve into testimonial statements,\xe2\x80\x9d 829 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 457, once that purpose has been achieved.  In this case, for example, after the operator gained the information needed to address the exigency of the moment, the emergency appears to have ended (when Davis drove away from the premises).  The operator then told McCottry to be quiet, and proceeded to pose a battery of questions.  It could readily be maintained that, from that point on, McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s statements were testimonial, not unlike the \xe2\x80\x9cstructured police questioning\xe2\x80\x9d that occurred in <em>Crawford</em>,<em> </em>541 U. S., at 53, n. 4.  This presents no great problem.  Just as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, \xe2\x80\x9cpolice officers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New York</em> v. <em>Quarles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a>, 658\xe2\x80\x93659 (1984), trial courts will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment purposes, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial.  Through <em>in limine </em>procedure, they should redact or exclude the portions of any statement that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.  Davis\xe2\x80\x99s jury did not hear the <em>complete </em>911 call, although it may well have heard some testimonial portions.  We were asked to classify only McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s early statements identifying Davis as her assailant, and we agree with the Washington Supreme Court that they were not testimonial.  That court also concluded that, even if later parts of the call were testimonial, their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Davis does not challenge that holding, and we therefore assume it to be correct.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Determining the testimonial or nontestimonial character of the statements that were the product of the interrogation in <em>Hammon </em>is a much easier task, since they were not much different from the statements we found to be testimonial in <em>Crawford.  </em>It is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct\xe2\x80\x94as, indeed, the testifying officer expressly acknowledged, App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705, at 25, 32, 34.  There was no emergency in progress; the interrogating officer testified that he had heard no arguments or crashing and saw no one throw or break anything, <em>id.</em>, at 25.  When the officers first arrived, Amy told them that things were fine, <em>id.</em>, at 14, and there was no immediate threat to her person.  When the officer questioned Amy for the second time, and elicited the challenged statements, he was not seeking to determine (as in <em>Davis</em>) \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is happening,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened.\xe2\x80\x9d  Objectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime\xe2\x80\x94which is, of course, precisely what the officer <em>should </em>have done.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the <em>Crawford </em>interrogation was more formal.  It followed a <em>Miranda </em>warning, was tape-recorded, and took place at the station house, see 541 U. S., at 53, n.\xc2\xa04.  While these features certainly strengthened the statements\xe2\x80\x99 testimonial aspect\xe2\x80\x94made it more objectively apparent, that is, that the purpose of the exercise was to nail down the truth about past criminal events\xe2\x80\x94none was essential to the point.  It was formal enough that Amy\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation was conducted in a separate room, away from her husband (who tried to intervene), with the officer receiving her replies for use in his \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigat[ion].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705, at 34.  What we called the \xe2\x80\x9cstriking resemblance\xe2\x80\x9d of the <em>Crawford </em>statement to civil-law <em>ex parte </em>examinations, 541 U. S., at 52, is shared by Amy\xe2\x80\x99s statement here.  Both declarants were actively separated from the defendant\xe2\x80\x94officers forcibly prevented Hershel from participating in the interrogation.  Both statements deliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed.  And both took place some time after the events described were over.  Such statements under official interrogation are an obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a wit-\nness does </em>on direct examination; they are inherently \ntestimonial.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both Indiana and the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> argue that this case should be resolved much like <em>Davis</em>.  For the reasons we find the comparison to <em>Crawford </em>compelling, we find the comparison to <em>Davis</em> unpersuasive.  The statements in <em>Davis </em>were taken when McCottry was alone, not only unprotected by police (as Amy Hammon was protected), but apparently in immediate danger from Davis.  She was seeking aid, not telling a story about the past.  McCottry\xe2\x80\x99s present-tense statements showed immediacy; Amy\xe2\x80\x99s narrative of past events was delivered at some remove in time from the danger she described.  And after Amy answered the officer\xe2\x80\x99s questions, he had her execute an affidavit, in order, he testified, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o establish events that have occurred previously.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705, at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we necessarily reject the Indiana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s implication that virtually any \xe2\x80\x9cinitial inquiries\xe2\x80\x9d at the crime scene will not be testimonial, see 829 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 453, 457, we do not hold the opposite\xe2\x80\x94that <em>no </em>questions at the scene will yield nontestimonial answers.  We have already observed of domestic disputes that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]fficers called to investigate \xe2\x80\xa6 need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hiibel,</em> 542 U. S., at 186.  Such exigencies may <em>often </em>mean that \xe2\x80\x9cinitial inquiries\xe2\x80\x9d produce nontestimonial statements.  But in cases like this one, where Amy\xe2\x80\x99s statements were neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation, the fact that they were given at an alleged crime scene and were \xe2\x80\x9cinitial inquiries\xe2\x80\x9d is immaterial.  Cf. <em>Crawford, supra</em>, at 52, n.\xc2\xa03.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents in both cases, joined by a number of their <em>amici</em>, contend that the nature of the offenses charged in these two cases\xe2\x80\x94domestic violence\xe2\x80\x94requires greater flexibility in the use of testimonial evidence.  This particular type of crime is notoriously susceptible to intimidation or coercion of the victim to ensure that she does not testify at trial.  When this occurs, the Confrontation Clause gives the criminal a windfall.  We may not, however, vitiate constitutional guarantees when they have the effect of allowing the guilty to go free.  Cf. <em>Kyllo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/27/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/27/index.html">533 U. S. 27</a> (2001) (suppressing evidence from an illegal search).  But when defendants seek to undermine the judicial process by procuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims, the Sixth Amendment does not require courts to acquiesce.  While defendants have no duty to assist the State in proving their guilt, they <em>do </em>have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system.  We reiterate what we said in <em>Crawford:</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing \xe2\x80\xa6 extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 62 (citing <em>Reynolds,</em> 98 U. S., at 158\xe2\x80\x93159).  That is, one who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We take no position on the standards necessary to demonstrate such forfeiture, but federal courts using Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6), which codifies the forfeiture doctrine, have generally held the Government to the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott</em>, 284 F.\xc2\xa03d 758, 762 (CA7 2002).  State courts tend to follow the same practice, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards</em>, 444 Mass. 526, 542, 830 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 158, 172 (2005).  Moreover, if a hearing on forfeiture is required, <em>Edwards</em>, for instance, observed that \xe2\x80\x9chearsay evidence, including the unavailable witness\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements, may be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 545, 830 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 174.  The <em>Roberts</em> approach to the Confrontation Clause undoubtedly made recourse to this doctrine less necessary, because prosecutors could show the \xe2\x80\x9creliability\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>ex parte </em>statements more easily than they could show the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s procurement of the witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence.  <em>Crawford</em>, in overruling <em>Roberts</em>, did not destroy the ability of courts to protect the integrity of their proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have determined that, absent a finding of forfeiture by wrongdoing, the Sixth Amendment operates to exclude Amy Hammon\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit.  The Indiana courts may (if they are asked) determine on remand whether such a claim of forfeiture is properly raised and, if so, whether it is meritorious.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington in No. 05\xe2\x80\x935224.

For <em>those</em> cases, the test is objective and quite \xe2\x80\x9cworkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The dissent, in attempting to formulate an exhaustive classification of its own, has not provided anything that deserves the description \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94unless one thinks that the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinformal\xe2\x80\x9d statements, see <em>post, </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935, qualifies.  And the dissent even qualifies that vague distinction by acknowledging that the Confrontation Clause \xe2\x80\x9calso reaches the use of technically informal statements when used to evade the formalized process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 5, and cautioning that the Clause would stop the State from \xe2\x80\x9cus[ing] out-of-court statements as a means of circumventing the literal right of confrontation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6.  It is hard to see this as much more \xe2\x80\x9cpredictable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, than the rule we adopt for the narrow situations we address.  (Indeed, under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach it is eminently arguable that the dissent should agree, rather than disagree, with our disposition in <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Indiana</em>, No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705<em>.</em>)</p>\n<p>\n\nAs for the charge that our holding is not a \xe2\x80\x9ctargeted attempt to reach the abuses forbidden by the [Confrontation] Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d which the dissent describes as the depositions taken by Marian magistrates, characterized by a high degree of formality, see <em>post, </em>at 2\xe2\x80\x933: We do not dispute that formality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance.  But we no longer have examining Marian magistrates; and we do have, as our 18th-century forebears did not, examining police officers, see L.

Langbein, The Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 41 (2003).  It imports sufficient formality, in our view, that lies to such officers are criminal offenses.  Restricting the Confrontation Clause to the precise forms against which it was originally directed is a recipe for its extinction.  Cf. <em>Kyllo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/27/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/27/index.html">533 U.

While prosecutors may hope that inculpatory \xe2\x80\x9cnontestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d evidence is gathered, this is essentially beyond police control.  Their saying that an emergency exists cannot make it be so.  The Confrontation Clause in no way governs police conduct, because it is the trial <em>use </em>of, not the investigatory <em>collection </em>of, <em>ex parte </em>testimonial statements which offends that provision.

The history surrounding the right to confrontation supports the conclusion that it was developed to target particular practices that occurred under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary, namely, the \xe2\x80\x9ccivil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte</em> examinations as evidence against the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 43, 50; <em>White</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 361\xe2\x80\x93362 (opinion of Thomas, J.); <em>Mattox</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/156/237/index.html">156 U.

The statute required an oral examination of the suspect and the accusers, transcription within two days of the examinations, and physical transmission to the judges hearing the case.  <em>Id</em>., at 10, 23.  These examinations came to be used as evidence in some cases, in lieu of a personal appearance by the witness.  <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344; 9 W.\xc2\xa0Holdsworth, A History of English Law 223\xe2\x80\x93229 (1926). <em> </em>Many statements that would be inadmissible as a matter of hearsay law bear little resemblance to these evidentiary practices, which the Framers proposed the Confrontation Clause to prevent.

Accordingly, it is unlikely that the Framers intended the word \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d to be read so broadly as to include such statements.

(quoting Webster, <em>supra</em>).  Admittedly, we did not set forth a detailed framework for addressing whether a statement is \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d and thus subject to the Confrontation Clause.  But the plain terms of the \xe2\x80\x9ctestimony\xe2\x80\x9d definition we endorsed necessarily require some degree of solemnity before a statement can be deemed \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This requirement of solemnity supports my view that the statements regulated by the Confrontation Clause must include \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial statements \xe2\x80\xa6 contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>White</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 365 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Affidavits, depositions, and prior testimony are, by their very nature, taken through a formalized process.  Likewise, confessions, when extracted by police in a formal manner, carry sufficient indicia of solemnity to constitute formalized statements and, accordingly, bear a \xe2\x80\x9cstriking resemblance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Crawford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 52, to the examinations of the accused and accusers under the Marian statutes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See generally Langbein, <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court concedes that the early American cases invoking the right to confrontation or the Confrontation Clause itself all \xe2\x80\x9cclearly involve[d] testimony\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in <em>Crawford</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 9,<em> </em>it fails to acknowledge that all of the cases it cites fall within the narrower category of formalized testimonial materials I have proposed.

Instead, the sole basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is its apprehension that the Confrontation Clause will \xe2\x80\x9creadily be evaded\xe2\x80\x9d if it is only applicable to formalized testimonial materials.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proposed solution to the risk of evasion is needlessly overinclusive.  Because the Confrontation Clause sought to regulate prosecutorial abuse occurring through use of <em>ex parte</em> statements as evidence against the accused, it also reaches the use of technically informal statements when used to evade the formalized process.  Cf. <em>ibid.</em>  That is, even if the interrogation itself is not formal, the production of evidence by the prosecution at trial would resemble the abuses targeted by the Confrontation Clause if the prosecution attempted to use out-of-court statements as a means of circumventing the literal right of confrontation, see <em>Coy</em> v. <em>Iowa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/1012/index.html">487 U. S. 1012</a> (1988).  In such a case, the Confrontation Clause could fairly be applied to exclude the hearsay statements offered by the prosecution, preventing evasion without simultaneously excluding evidence offered by the prosecution in good faith.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard is not only disconnected from history and unnecessary to prevent abuse; it also yields no predictable results to police officers and prosecutors attempting to comply with the law.

S., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (limiting the Confrontation Clause to the discrete category of materials historically abused would \xe2\x80\x9cgreatly simplify\xe2\x80\x9d application of the Clause).<em> </em>In many, if not most, cases where police respond to a report of a crime, whether pursuant to a 911 call from the victim or otherwise, the purposes of an interrogation, viewed from the perspective of the police, are <em>both</em> to respond to the emergency situation <em>and </em>to gather evidence.  See <em>New York</em> v. <em>Quarles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/649/index.html">467 U. S. 649</a>, 656 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly most police officers [deciding whether to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a possible emergency situation] would act out of a host of different, instinctive, and largely unverifiable motives\xe2\x80\x94their own safety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire to obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>Assigning one of these two \xe2\x80\x9clargely unverifiable motives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., primacy requires constructing a hierarchy of purpose that will rarely be present\xe2\x80\x94and is not reliably discernible.  It will inevitably be, quite simply, an exercise in fiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated invocation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cobjectiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d to describe its test, see <em>ante</em>, at 7, 11\xe2\x80\x9313, 15, however, suggests that the Court may not mean to reference purpose at all, but instead to inquire into the function served by the interrogation.  Certainly such a test would avoid the pitfalls that have led us repeatedly to reject tests dependent on the subjective intentions of police officers.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It would do so, however, at the cost of being even more disconnected from the prosecutorial abuses targeted by the Confrontation Clause. Additionally, it would shift the ability to control whether a violation occurred from the police and prosecutor to the judge, whose determination as to the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of a particular interrogation would be unpredictable and not necessarily tethered to the actual purpose for which the police performed the interrogation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the 911 call at issue in <em>Davis</em> nor the police questioning at issue in <em>Hammon </em>is testimonial under the appropriate framework.  Neither the call nor the questioning is itself a formalized dialogue.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Nor do any circumstances surrounding the taking of the statements render those statements sufficiently formal to resemble the Marian examinations; the statements were neither Mirandized nor custodial, nor accompanied by any similar indicia of formality.  Finally, there is no suggestion that the prosecution attempted to offer the women\xe2\x80\x99s hearsay evidence at trial in order to evade confrontation.  See 829 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 444, 447 (Ind. 2005) (prosecution subpoenaed Amy Hammon to testify, but she was not present); 154 Wash. 2d 291, 296, 111 P.\xc2\xa03d 844, 847 (2005) (en banc) (State was unable to locate Michelle McCottry at the time of trial).  Accordingly, the statements at issue in both cases are nontestimonial and admissible under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the evidence against Hammon must be excluded extends the Confrontation Clause far beyond the abuses it was intended to prevent.  When combined with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the evidence against Davis is perfectly admissible, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Hammon </em>holding also reveals the difficulty of applying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that courts investigate the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of the investigation.  The Court draws a line between the two cases based on its explanation that <em>Hammon </em>involves \xe2\x80\x9cno emergency in progress,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead, mere questioning as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, and its explanation that <em>Davis</em> involves questioning for the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cenabl[ing] police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13.  But the fact that the officer in <em>Hammon </em>was investigating Mr. Hammon\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct does not foreclose the possibility that the primary purpose of his inquiry was to assess whether Mr. Hammon constituted a continuing danger to his wife, requiring further police presence or action.  It is hardly remarkable that Hammon did not act abusively towards his wife in the presence of the officers, <em>ante</em>, at 15,<em> </em>and his good judgment to refrain from criminal behavior in the presence of police sheds little, if any, light on whether his violence would have resumed had the police left without further questioning, transforming what the Court dismisses as \xe2\x80\x9cpast conduct\xe2\x80\x9d back into an \xe2\x80\x9congoing emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, 15.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Nor does the mere fact that McCottry needed emergency aid shed light on whether the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of gathering, for example, the name of her assailant was to protect the police, to protect the victim, or to gather information for prosecution.  In both of the cases before the Court, like many similar cases, pronouncement of the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d motive behind the interrogation calls for nothing more than a guess by courts.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the standard adopted by the Court today is neither workable nor a targeted attempt to reach the abuses forbidden by the Clause, I concur only in the judgment in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, No. 05\xe2\x80\x935224, and respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of <em>Hammon</em> v. <em>Indiana</em>, No. 05\xe2\x80\x935705.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Like the Court, I presume the acts of the 911 operator to be the acts of the police.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa02.
