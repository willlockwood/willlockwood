These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) should impute a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child.  That issue arises because a child may enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his parents does\xe2\x80\x94meaning that a parent may satisfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) or \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not.  In In\xc2\xa0re Escobar, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien must meet \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements on his own.  But the Ninth Circuit found the Board\xe2\x80\x99s position unreasonable, holding that \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) and \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2) require imputation.  See Mercado-Zazueta v.

Martinez Gutierrez\xe2\x80\x99s father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.  But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003.  Two years after that, he was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border.  Admitting the offense, he sought cancellation of removal.  The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father\xe2\x80\x99s immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could not satisfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) or \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2) on his own.  Relying on Escobar, the BIA reversed.  The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old.  At that time, his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry.  After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August 2002, the Government began removal proceedings.  The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he could not satisfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2).  The BIA affirmed, and Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review.  There, he argued that the Board should have counted his mother\xe2\x80\x99s years of residency while he was a minor toward \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s 7-year continuous-residency requirement.  The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the BIA.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of imputation is based on a permissible construction of \xc2\xa71229b(a).  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements on his own, without relying on a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of continuous residence or immigration status.  That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.  See e.g., Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93844, and n.\xc2\xa011.  The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach satisfies this standard.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Board\xe2\x80\x99s position is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Section 1229b(a) does not mention\xe2\x80\x94much less require\xe2\x80\x94imputation.  Instead, it simply calls for \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x9d to meet the prerequisites for cancellation of removal.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33).  Respondents contend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so, that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Neither does the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history and context mandate imputation.  Section 1229b(a) replaced former \xc2\xa7212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained a \xe2\x80\x9clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\xe2\x80\x9d in this country.  Like \xc2\xa71229b(a), \xc2\xa7212(c) was silent on imputation.  But every Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in determining eligibility for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief, the Board should impute a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of domicile to his or her child.  Based on this history, Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language to provide for imputation.  But in enacting \xc2\xa71229b(a), Congress eliminated the very term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdomicile\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94on which the appeals courts had founded their imputation decisions.  And the doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do the INA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes demand imputation.  As respondents correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with strong ties to this country.  But these are not the INA\xe2\x80\x99s only goals, and Congress did not pursue them at all costs.  For example, aliens convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.  A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the Board\xe2\x80\x99s position is not entitled to Chevron deference.  First, they claim that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \xc2\xa71229b(a) is arbitrary because it is inconsistent with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of imputation under other, similar provisions that are silent on the matter.  See \xc2\xa71182(k) and \xc2\xa71181(b).  But the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an alien\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, while declining to impute objective conditions or characteristics.  See 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration status and place of residence.  See id., at 233.  So the Board\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \xc2\xa71229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward distinction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice.  But Escobar belies this contention.  The Board did explain how \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text supports its no-imputation policy.  But the Board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under \xc2\xa71229b(a) would create anomalies in the statutory scheme.  Escobar thus expressed the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s view that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation.  In making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.

C. \xc2\xa71229b(a), authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien from the United States so long as the alien satisfies certain criteria.  One of those criteria relates to the length of time an alien has lawfully resided in the United States, and another to the length of time he has held permanent resident status here.  We consider whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably conclude that an alien living in this country as a child must meet those requirements on his own, without counting a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of residence or immigration status.  We hold that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe immigration laws have long given the Attorney General discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable aliens to remain in the United States.  See Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934).  The Attorney General formerly exercised this authority by virtue of \xc2\xa7212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), \n\n66Stat.\n187, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.), a provision with some lingering relevance here, see infra, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  But in 1996, Congress replaced \xc2\xa7212(c) with \xc2\xa71229b(a) (2006 ed.).  That new section, applicable to the cases before us, provides as follows:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\xe2\x80\x94\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tSection 1229b(a) thus specifies the criteria that make an alien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney General.  The first paragraph requires that the alien have held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least five years.  And the second adds that the alien must have lived in the United States for at least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, whether as an LPR or in some other immigration status.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  (The third paragraph is not at issue in these cases.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question we consider here is whether, in applying this statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child.  That question arises because a child may enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his parents does.  A parent may therefore satisfy the re- quirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her child, considered independently, does not.  In these circum- stances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to confront this issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief.  See Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 1013 (2005).  Enrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United States illegally in 1985, when he was one year old.  Cuevas-Gaspar\xe2\x80\x99s mother was lawfully admitted to the country in 1990, as an LPR.  But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully admitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status.  That meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a removable offense in 2002, he could not independently sat- isfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of seven consecutive years of residence after a lawful entry.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  (The parties agreed that he just met \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year status requirement.)  The Board deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that account, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unreasonable.  According to the Court of Appeals, the Board should have \xe2\x80\x9cimputed\xe2\x80\x9d to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother\xe2\x80\x99s years of continuous residence during the time he lived with her as an \xe2\x80\x9cunemancipated minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1029.  That approach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both the INA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpriorit[ization]\xe2\x80\x9d of familial relations and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent willingness\xe2\x80\x9d to make imputations from a parent to a child in many areas of immigration law.

In In\xc2\xa0re Escobar, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board considered whether a child could rely on a parent\xe2\x80\x99s period of LPR status to satisfy \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s 5-year clock.  The Board expressly \xe2\x80\x9cdisagree[d] with the reasoning\xe2\x80\x9d of Cuevas-Gaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of both the statute and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s prior policies.  24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Accordingly, the Board announced that it would \xe2\x80\x9cdecline to extend\xe2\x80\x9d Cuevas-Gaspar to any case involving \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1), and that it would ignore the decision even as to \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2) outside the Ninth Circuit.  24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 235.  A year later, in Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 599 (2008), the BIA took the final step: It rejected imputation under \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, maintaining that the court should abandon Cuevas-Gaspar and defer to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s intervening reasoned decision in Escobar.  See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 600\xe2\x80\x93601 (citing National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v.

The Third and Fifth Circuits both deferred to the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach as a reasonable construction of \xc2\xa71229b(a).  See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F.\xc2\xa03d 264 (CA3 2008); Deus v.

See id., at 1103 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar apply equally to the five-year permanent residence and the seven-year continuance residence requirements\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71229b(a)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo cases are before us.  In 1989, at the age of five, respondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the United States with his family.  Martinez Gutierrez\xe2\x80\x99s father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.  But Martinez Gutierrez himself was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003.  Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border.  He admitted the offense, and sought cancellation of removal.  The Immigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father\xe2\x80\x99s immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could not satisfy either \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) or \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2) on his own.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x931542, pp. 20a\xe2\x80\x9322a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 1013).  The BIA reversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand, reaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on Escobar, see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x931542, at 5a\xe2\x80\x936a.  The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of the court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decisions.

At that time, his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry.  After Sawyers\xe2\x80\x99s conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the Government initiated removal proceedings.  The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he was a few months shy of the seven years of continuous residence required under \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x931543, p. 13a.  (No one doubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status for five years, as required under \xc2\xa71229b(a)(1).)  The Board affirmed, relying on its reasoning in Escobar.  See In re Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec. 26, 2007).  Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review, arguing that the Board should have counted his mother\xe2\x80\x99s years of residency while he was a minor toward \xc2\xa71229b(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s 7-year requirement.

That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93844, and n.\xc2\xa011 (1984); see also INS v.

We think the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s view on imputation meets that standard, and so need not decide if the statute permits any other construction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Board\xe2\x80\x99s approach is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, as even respondents tacitly concede.  Section 1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require it.  The provision calls for \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not, say, \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien or one of his parents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to meet the three prerequisites for cancellation of removal.  Similarly, several of \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s other terms have statutory definitions referring to only a single individual.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe terms \xe2\x80\x98admission\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98admitted\xe2\x80\x99 mean, with respect to an alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa71101(a)(33) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98residence\xe2\x80\x99 means the place of general abode; the place of general abode of a person means his principal, actual dwelling\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Respondents contend that none of this language \xe2\x80\x9cforecloses\xe2\x80\x9d imputation: They argue that if the Board allowed imputation, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he alien\xe2\x80\x9d seeking cancellation would \xe2\x80\x9cstill have to satisfy the provision\xe2\x80\x99s durational requirements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94just pursuant to a different computational rule.

And they claim that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s history of permitting imputation under similarly \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d statutes supports this construction.  Martinez Gutierrez Brief 16; see Sawyers Brief 15\xe2\x80\x9316; infra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But even if so\xe2\x80\x94even if the Board could adopt an imputation rule consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x94that would not avail respondents.  Taken alone, the language of \xc2\xa71229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way\xe2\x80\x94to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien\xe2\x80\x9d must meet the statutory conditions independently, without relying on a parent\xe2\x80\x99s history.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor this reason, respondents focus on \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s history and context\xe2\x80\x94particularly, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to the INA\xe2\x80\x99s former \xc2\xa7212(c) and its associated imputation rule.  Section 212(c)\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor\xe2\x80\x94generally allowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained a \xe2\x80\x9clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\xe2\x80\x9d in this country.  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.).  Like \xc2\xa71229b(a), \xc2\xa7212(c) was silent on imputation.  Yet the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits (the only appellate courts to consider the question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for relief under \xc2\xa7212(c), the Board should impute a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of domicile to his or her child.  See Rosario v. INS, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 220 (CA2 1992); Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F.\xc2\xa03d 1021, 1024\xe2\x80\x931026 (CA9 1994); Morel v. INS, 90 F.\xc2\xa03d 833, 840\xe2\x80\x93842 (CA3 1996).  Those courts reasoned that at common law, a minor\xe2\x80\x99s domicile was \xe2\x80\x9cthe same as that of its parents, since most children are presumed not legally capable of forming the requisite intent to establish their own domicile.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rosario, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 224; see Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30, \n48 (1989)\n (defining \xe2\x80\x9cdomicile\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cphysical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one\xe2\x80\x99s intent to remain there\xe2\x80\x9d).  So by the time Congress replaced \xc2\xa7212(c) with \xc2\xa71229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent\xe2\x80\x99s years of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for cancellation of removal.  Sawyers argues that against this backdrop, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cwould have understood the language it chose [in \xc2\xa71229b(a)] to provide for imputation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sawyers Brief 10.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an imputation requirement when it passed \xc2\xa71229b(a).  As all parties agree, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve an unrelated question about \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  See id., at 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner 25.  Courts had differed on whether an alien\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cseven consecutive years\xe2\x80\x9d of domicile under \xc2\xa7212(c) all had to post-date the alien\xe2\x80\x99s obtaining LPR status.  See Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1027\xe2\x80\x931028 (canvassing split).  Congress addressed that split by creating two distinct durational conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsection (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an LPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of subsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the acquisition of LPR status.  In doing so, Congress elimi- nated the very term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdomicile\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94on which the appeals courts had founded their imputation decisions.  See supra, at 8.  That alteration dooms respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position, because the doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without relevant change.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, \n349 (2005)\n.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  So the statutory history here provides no basis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional command in adopting its no-imputation policy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do the INA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes demand imputation here, as both respondents claim.  According to Martinez Gutierrez, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach contradicts that statute\xe2\x80\x99s objectives of \xe2\x80\x9cproviding relief to aliens with strong ties to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting family unity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Martinez Gutierrez Brief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37.  We agree\xe2\x80\x94indeed, we have stated\xe2\x80\x94that the goals respondents identify underlie or inform many provisions of immigration law.  See Fiallo v. Bell, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (1977); INS v. Errico, \n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214, \n220 (1966)\n.  But they are not the INA\xe2\x80\x99s only goals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth degree.  To take one example, \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s third paragraph makes aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for cancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties.  See \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3).  And more generally\xe2\x80\x94as these very cases show\xe2\x80\x94not every alien who obtains LPR status can immediately get the same for her spouse or minor children.  See Brief for Petitioner 31\xe2\x80\x9332, and n.\xc2\xa09 (providing program-specific examples).  We cannot read a silent statute as requiring (not merely allowing) imputation just because that rule would be family-friendly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents\xe2\x80\x99 stronger arguments take a different tack\xe2\x80\x94that we should refuse to defer to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision even assuming Congress placed the question of imputation in its hands.  Respondents offer two main reasons.  First, they contend that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \xc2\xa71229b(a) cannot be squared with its acceptance of imputation under other, similar statutory provisions.  This \xe2\x80\x9cwil[d]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[u]n- explained inconsistency,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Sawyers asserts, is the very \xe2\x80\x9cparadigm of arbitrary agency action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sawyers Brief 13, 41 (emphasis deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52\xe2\x80\x9354.  Second, they argue that the Board did not appreciate its own discretion over whether to allow imputation.  The Board, they say, thought Congress had forbidden imputation, and so did not bring its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98experience and expertise to bear\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue.  Id., at 31 (quoting PDK Labs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F.\xc2\xa03d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see Sawyers Brief 38\xe2\x80\x9339.  These arguments are not insubstantial, but in the end neither persuades us to deny the Board the usual deference we accord to agency interpretations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStart with the claim of inconsistency.  The BIA has indeed imputed parental attributes to children under other INA provisions that do not mention the matter.  Section 1182(k), for example, enables the Attorney General to let certain inadmissible aliens into the country if he finds \xe2\x80\x9cthat inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Like \xc2\xa71229b(a), that provision refers to a single person (\xe2\x80\x9cthe immigrant\xe2\x80\x9d) and says nothing about imputation.  But the BIA has consistently imputed a parent\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of inadmissibility (or lack thereof) to a child.  See, e.g., Senica v. INS, 16 F.\xc2\xa03d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, the BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief under [\xc2\xa71182(k)] because [their mother\xe2\x80\x99s] knowledge was imputed to them\xe2\x80\x9d); In\xc2\xa0re Mushtaq, No. A43 968 082, 2007 WL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per\xc2\xa0curiam); In\xc2\xa0re Ahmed, No. A41 982 631, 2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17, 2006) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, the Board imputes a parent\xe2\x80\x99s abandonment (or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when determining whether that child can reenter the country as a \xe2\x80\x9creturning resident immigran[t]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71181(b).  See Matter of Zamora, 17 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (hold- ing that a \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary and intended abandonment by the mother is imputed\xe2\x80\x9d to an unemancipated minor child for purposes of applying \xc2\xa71181(b)); Matter of Huang, 19 I. &amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 749, 755\xe2\x80\x93756 (1988) (concluding that a mother and her children abandoned their LPR status based solely on the mother\xe2\x80\x99s intent); In\xc2\xa0re Ali, No. A44 143 723, 2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a child could not have abandoned his LPR status if his mother had not abandoned hers).  And once again, that is so even though neither \xc2\xa71181(b) nor any other statutory provision says that the BIA should look to the parent in assessing the child\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for reentry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an alien\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, while declining to impute objective conditions or characteristics.  See 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, and n.\xc2\xa04.  On one side of the line, knowledge of inadmissibility is all and only about a mental state.  See, e.g., Senica, 16 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1015; In\xc2\xa0re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156.  Likewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintention of . . . returning to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to live as a permanent resident, Zamora, 17 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 396; the Board thus explained that imputing abandonment is \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child cannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her own domicile,\xe2\x80\x9d Escobar, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 234, n.\xc2\xa04.  And as that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of the former \xc2\xa7212(c) also involved intent and so lent itself to imputation.  See Rosario, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 224; supra, at 8.  But the 5- and 7-year clocks of \xc2\xa71229b(a) fall on the other side of the line, because they hinge not on any state of mind but on the objective facts of immigration status and place of residence.  See Escobar, 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 233 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e find that residence is different from domicile because it \xe2\x80\x98contains no element of subjective intent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J., dissenting))).  The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s varied rulings on imputation thus largely follow from one straightforward distinction.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, Escobar belies respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice.  The Board, to be sure, did not highlight the statute\xe2\x80\x99s gaps or ambiguity; rather, it read \xc2\xa71229b(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text to support its conclusion that each alien must personally meet that section\xe2\x80\x99s durational requirements.  See 24 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 235.  But the Board also explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthere [was] no precedent\xe2\x80\x9d in its decisions for imputing status or residence, and distinguished those statutory terms, on the ground just explained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status.  Id., at 234; see id., at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, and n.\xc2\xa04.  And the Board argued that allowing imputation under \xc2\xa71229b(a) would create anomalies in administration of the statutory scheme by permitting even those who had not obtained LPR status\xe2\x80\x94or could not do so because of a criminal history\xe2\x80\x94to become eligible for cancellation of removal.  See id., at 234\xe2\x80\x93235, and n.\xc2\xa05.  The Board therefore saw neither a \xe2\x80\x9clogical\xe2\x80\x9d nor a \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d basis for adopting a policy of imputation.  Id., at 233.  We see nothing in this decision to suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it might have reached a different result if assured it could do so.  To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s view, based on its experience implementing the INA, that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all pointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.  In making that case, the decision reads like a multitude of agency interpretations\xe2\x80\x94not the best example, but far from the worst\xe2\x80\x94to which we and other courts have routinely deferred.

And the sources on which respondents rely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a regional commissioner (not the Board itself) that considered the conduct of both the parents and the child, see Matter of Ng, 12 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth Circuit decision imputing a parent\xe2\x80\x99s resettlement even though the Board had focused only on the child\xe2\x80\x99s actions, see Vang v. INS, 146 F.\xc2\xa03d 1114, 1117 (1998).  Based on these scant decisions, we cannot conclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let alone one inconsistent with Escobar.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
