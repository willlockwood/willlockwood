But note what 5(2)(a) says when a purchase of property is involved: </p><ul>\'It shall be lawful, with the approval and authorization of the Commission, as provided in subdivision (b)-</ul> <ul>\'(i) ... for any carrier ... to purchase ... the properties ... of another ....\'</ul> <p> We learn from the decisions of the Commission that when a purchase of assets is involved, only the purchaser need make application for the unification. There are at least eight cases which illustrate the procedure. </p><p> Of these eight, five involve intracorporate transactions, e.g., purchases of the property of a subsidiary by a parent. See Erie R. Co. Purchase, 254 I.C.C. 486; Chesapeake &amp; O.R. Co. Purchase, 261 I.C.C. 239; Southern R. Co. Purchase, 275 I.C.C. 724; Seaboard R. Co. Acquisition, 257 I.C.C 584 (purchase of former subsidiary by reorganized parent). Cf. Wheeling &amp; L.E.R. Co. Control, 254 I.C.C. 632 (stock acquisition). Three of the eight cases involve transactions which have all the elements of armslength bargaining. See Gulf, M. &amp; O.R. Co. Purchase, 261 I.C.C. 623 ( purchase of a former jointly-owned subsidiary at a foreclosure sale); Cambria &amp; I.R. Co. Control, 275 I.C.C. 360 (stock acquisition by noncarrier); Gulf, M. &amp; O.R. Co. Purchase, Securities, 261 I.C.C. 405, approving purchase contemplated by the plan of reorganization in Alton R. Co. Reorganization, 261 I.C.C. 343. The latter case involved an arms- length transaction in which the purchase was worked out in a 77 reorganization, but approved under 5(2) on the application of the purchaser alone. The reorganization plan was confirmed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="983">Page 347 U.S. 980, 983</a></p><p> by the reorganization court and the purchase consummated. See In re Alton R. Co., 7 Cir., 159 F.2d 200. </p><p> It, therefore, seems that a sale of assets may be approved under 5( 2) on the application of the purchaser alone. In the Erie case, supra, the Commission specifically held that the vendors were not necessary parties to an application under 5(2). There the application had been made jointly by the vendeeparent and the vendor-subsidiaries, and the Commission dismissed the application of the vendors. </p><p> In the present cases, Atlantic Coast Line has received the permission of the Commission under 5(2) to purchase the assets of Florida East Coast, subject to the conditions of 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. No attempt is made to challenge the adequacy of the findings of the Commission under 5. If the substantive provisions of 5 are satisfied, and if only the purchaser need apply under 5, why do the bankruptcy trustees lack authority to dispose of this property to Atlantic Coast Line, once the requirements of 77 are satisfied? </p><p> It is not apparent why that authority is lacking. Bankruptcy trustees from the beginning have had the power of sale, subject to control by the bankruptcy court. </p><p> I, therefore, thought it appropriate that these cases be put down for a rehearing limited to the following question: </p><p> It being decided that the debtor may not on this record merge or consolidate with Atlantic Coast Line, may the bankruptcy court nevertheless authorize the transfer of the property of the debtor to Atlantic Coast Line, if all the requirements of 77 are satisfied? </p><p> This point is a substantial one which has not been ruled upon by any court. Since the Court now denies these petitions, the question will be open on remand of the cases.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
