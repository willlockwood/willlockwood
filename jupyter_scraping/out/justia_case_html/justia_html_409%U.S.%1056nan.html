Each was a specialist in the area in which he conducted his examination. Purporting to follow Army regulations governing the standards for retention in the Army, one determined that petitioner has a disqualifying foot condition and another that he has a disqualifying allergic condition. The third, a psychiatrist, found that petitioner\'s psychiatric condition, if further documented, would render him ineligible for service. Despite these findings, the Surgeon General, exercising his ex parte discretion pursuant to Army Regulation 40-501, determined that petitioner is qualified for active duty. The only substantiation for that decision submitted to the Court is a letter written by the Surgeon General to Senator Percy, in which he stated that petitioner\'s problems are not of sufficient severity to render him unfit under Army regulations.

While this action was pending, petitioner was ordered to active duty for training.

The difficulty I have with the procedure afforded petitioner is that the record does not disclose any basis for the Surgeon General\'s action.
