[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He alleged that he had been denied a promotion to a data systems analyst position with the Department of State Police for an improper reason, that is, because his brother had been a student activist and the subject of a "red squad" file maintained by respondent.  Named as defendants were the Department of State Police and the Director of State Police in his official capacity, also a respondent here. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court remanded the case to the Michigan Civil Service Commission for a grievance hearing.  While the grievance was pending, petitioner filed suit in the Michigan </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 491 U. S. 61</a></p><p> Court of Claims raising an essentially identical \xc2\xa7 1983 claim.  The Civil Service Commission ultimately found in petitioner\'s favor, ruling that respondents had refused to promote petitioner because of "partisan considerations."  App. 46.  On the basis of that finding, the state court judge, acting in both the Circuit Court and the Court of Claims cases, concluded that petitioner had established a violation of the United States Constitution.  The judge held that the Circuit Court action was barred under state law, but that the Claims Court action could go forward.  The judge also ruled that respondents were persons for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals vacated the judgment against the Department of State Police, holding that a State is not a person under \xc2\xa7 1983, but remanded the case for determination of the possible immunity of the Director of State Police from liability for damages.  The Michigan Supreme Court granted discretionary review and affirmed the Court of Appeals in part and reversed in part.  The Supreme Court agreed that the State itself is not a person under \xc2\xa7 1983, but held that a state official acting in his or her official capacity also is not such a person.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court\'s holding that a State is not a person under \xc2\xa7 1983 conflicts with a number of state and federal court decisions to the contrary.

"[T]hat being the case," we reasoned, \xc2\xa7 1983 "could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant." <em> Fitzpatrick v.

For the reasons that follow, we reaffirm today what we had concluded prior to <em>Monell</em> and what some have considered implicit in <em>Quern:</em>  that a State is not a person within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>We observe initially that, if a State is a "person" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983, the section is to be read as saying that</p>\n<p>"every person, including a State, who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects. . ."</p>\n<p>That would be a decidedly awkward way of expressing an intent to subject the States to liability.  At the very least, reading the statute in this way is not so clearly indicated that it provides reason to depart from the often-expressed understanding that</p>\n<p>"\'in common usage, the term \'person\' does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the [word] are ordinarily construed to exclude it.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Wilson v.

In <em>Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, supra,</em> we followed this rule in construing the phrase "white person" contained in 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194, enacted as Act of June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729, as not including the "sovereign States of the Union."  442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html#667">442 U.

Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor to \xc2\xa7 1983, shortly after the end of the Civil War</p>\n<p>"in response to the widespread deprivations of civil rights in the Southern States and the inability or unwillingness of authorities in those States to protect those rights or punish wrongdoers."</p>\n<p><em>Felder v.

Although Congress did not establish federal courts as the exclusive forum to remedy these deprivations, <em>ibid.,</em> it is plain that "Congress assigned to the federal courts a paramount role" in this endeavor, <em>Patsy v.

The Eleventh Amendment bars such suits unless the State has waived its immunity, <em>Welch v.

That Congress, in passing \xc2\xa7 1983, had no intention to disturb the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity and so to alter the federal-state balance in that respect was made clear in our decision in <em>Quern.</em>  Given that a principal purpose behind the enactment of \xc2\xa7 1983 was to provide a federal forum for civil rights claims, and that Congress did not provide such a federal forum for civil rights claims against States, we cannot accept petitioner\'s argument that Congress intended nevertheless to create a cause of action against States to be brought in state courts, which are precisely the courts Congress sought to allow civil rights claimants to avoid through \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>This does not mean, as petitioner suggests, that we think that the scope of the Eleventh Amendment and the scope of \xc2\xa7 1983 are not separate issues.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is further supported by our holdings that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983, Congress did not intend to override well established immunities or defenses under the common law.</p>\n<p>"One important assumption underlying the Court\'s decisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar with common law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to the contrary."</p>\n<p><em>Newport v.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 491 U. S. 68</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 does not suggest a different conclusion.  Petitioner contends that the congressional debates on \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act indicate that \xc2\xa7 1983 was intended to extend to the full reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, and thereby to provide a remedy "<em>against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.\'"  Brief for Petitioner 16 (quoting <em>Monell,</em> 436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#700">436 U. S. 700</a></span>-701).  He refers us to various parts of the vigorous debates accompanying the passage of \xc2\xa7 1983 and revealing that it was the failure of the States to take appropriate action that was undoubtedly the motivating force behind \xc2\xa7 1983.  The inference must be drawn, it is urged, that Congress must have intended to subject the States themselves to liability.  But the intent of Congress to provide a remedy for unconstitutional state action does not, without more, include the sovereign States among those persons against whom \xc2\xa7 1983 actions would lie.  Construing \xc2\xa7 1983 as a remedy for "official violation of federally protected rights" does no more than confirm that the section is directed against state action -- action "under color of" state law.  It does not suggest that the State itself was a person that Congress intended to be subject to liability.\n</em></p>\n<p>Although there were sharp and heated debates, the discussion of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Bill, which contained the present \xc2\xa7 1983, was not extended.  And although in other respects the impact on state sovereignty was much talked about, no one suggested that \xc2\xa7 1 would subject the States themselves to a damages suit under federal law.  <em>Quern,</em> 440 U.S. at 343.  There was complaint that \xc2\xa7 1 would subject state officers to damages liability, but no suggestion that it would also expose the States themselves.  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 491 U. S. 69</a></p><p> 366, 385 (1871).  We find nothing substantial in the legislative history that leads us to believe that Congress intended that the word "person" in \xc2\xa7 1983 included the States of the Union.  And surely nothing in the debates rises to the clearly expressed legislative intent necessary to permit that construction.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \xc2\xa7 2, 16 Stat. 431 (the "Dictionary Act"), [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] on which we relied in <em>Monell,</em> 436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#688">436 U. S. 688</a></span>-689, does not counsel a contrary conclusion here.  As we noted in <em>Quern,</em> that Act, while adopted prior to \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was adopted after \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act was derived.  440 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html#341">440 U. S. 341</a></span>, n. 11.  Moreover, we disagree with JUSTICE BRENNAN that, at the time the Dictionary Act was passed, "the phrase <em>bodies politic and corporate\' was understood to include the States."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#78">491 U. S. 78</a></span>.  Rather, an examination of authorities of the era suggests that the phrase was used to mean corporations, both private and public (municipal), and not to include the States. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In our view, the </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 491 U. S. 70</a></em></p><p><em> Dictionary Act, like \xc2\xa7 1983 itself and its legislative history, fails to evidence a clear congressional intent that States be held liable.\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Monell</em> itself is not to the contrary.  True, prior to <em>Monell,</em> the Court had reasoned that, if municipalities were not persons, then surely States also were not.  <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/case.html#452">427 U. S. 452</a></span>.  And <em>Monell</em> overruled <em>Monroe,</em> undercutting that logic.  But it does not follow that, if municipalities are persons, then so are States.  States are protected by the Eleventh Amendment, while municipalities are not, <em>Monell,</em> 436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U. S. 690</a></span>, n. 54, and we consequently limited our holding in <em>Monell</em> "to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes," <em>ibid.</em>  Conversely, our holding here does not cast any doubt on <em>Monell,</em> and applies only to States or governmental entities that are considered "arms of the State" for Eleventh Amendment purposes.  <em>See, e.g., Mt. Healthy Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">429 U.

S. 280</a></span> (1977).</p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts, alternatively, that state officials should be considered "persons" under \xc2\xa7 1983, even though acting in their official capacities.  In this case, petitioner named as defendant not only the Michigan Department of State Police but also the Director of State Police in his official capacity. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 491 U. S. 71</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Obviously, state officials literally are persons.  But a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official, but rather is a suit against the official\'s office.  <em>Brandon v.

A public corporation, in ordinary usage, was another term for a municipal corporation, and included towns, cities, and counties, but not States.  <em>See</em> 2 Abbott, <em>supra,</em> at 347; Anderson, <em>supra,</em> at 264-265; Black, <em>supra,</em> at 278; 2 Burrill, <em>supra,</em> at 352.\n</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN appears to confuse this precise definition of the phrase with its use "in a rather loose way," <em>see</em> Black, <em>supra,</em> at 143, to refer to <em>the</em> state (as opposed to <em>a</em> State).  This confusion is revealed most clearly in JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s reliance on the 1979 edition of Black\'s Law Dictionary, which defines "body politic or corporate" as</p>\n<p>"[a] social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#79">491 U.

The question presented is whether the word "persons" in this statute includes the States and state officials acting in their official capacities.</p>\n<p>One might expect that this statutory question would generate a careful and thorough analysis of the language, legislative history, and general background of \xc2\xa7 1983.  If this is what one expects, however, one will be disappointed by today\'s decision.  For this case is not decided on the basis of our ordinary method of statutory construction; instead, the Court disposes of it by means of various rules of statutory interpretation that it summons to its aid each time the question looks close.  Specifically, the Court invokes the following interpretative principles:  the word "persons" is ordinarily construed to exclude the sovereign; congressional intent to affect the federal-state balance must be "clear and manifest"; and intent to abrogate States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity must appear in the language of the statute itself.  The Court apparently believes that each of these rules obviates the need for close analysis of a statute\'s language and history.  Properly applied, however, only the last of these interpretative principles has this effect, and that principle is not pertinent to the case before us.</p>\n<p>The Court invokes, first, the "often-expressed understanding" that</p>\n<p>""in common usage, the term <em>person\' does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the [word] are ordinarily construed to exclude it."" </em></p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#64">491 U.

This rule is used both to refute the argument </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 491 U.

S. 69</a></span>-70.  It is ironic, to say the least, that the Court chooses this interpretive rule in explaining why the Dictionary Act is not decisive, since the rule is relevant only when the word "persons" has no statutory definition.  When one considers the origins and content of this interpretive guideline, moreover, one realizes that it is inapplicable here and, even if applied, would defeat, rather than support, the Court\'s approach and result.</p>\n<p>The idea that the word "persons" ordinarily excludes the sovereign can be traced to the "familiar principle that the King is not bound by any act of Parliament unless he be named therein by special and particular words."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/86/227/case.html">Dollar Savings Bank v.

S. 65</a></span>.  These cases do not, however, permit substitution of an absolutist rule of statutory construction for thorough statutory analysis.  Indeed, in each of these decisions, the Court undertook a careful and detailed analysis of the statutory language and history under consideration.  <em>Rice</em> is a particularly inapposite source for the interpretive method that the Court today employs, since it observes that, according to conventional preemption analysis, a "clear and manifest" intent to preempt state legislation may appear in the "scheme" or "purpose" of the federal statute.  <em>See</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The only principle of statutory construction employed by the Court that would justify a perfunctory and inconclusive analysis of a statute\'s language and history is one that is irrelevant to this case.  This is the notion</p>\n<p>"that if Congress intends to alter the \'usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,\' it must make its intention to do so \'unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#65">491 U.

As the Court notes, <em>Atascadero</em> was an Eleventh Amendment case; the "constitutional balance" to which <em>Atascadero</em> refers is that struck by the Eleventh Amendment as this Court has come to interpret it.  Although the Court apparently wishes it were otherwise, the principle of interpretation that <em>Atascadero</em> announced is unique to cases involving the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p>Where the Eleventh Amendment applies, the Court has devised a clear-statement principle more robust than its requirement of clarity in any other situation.  Indeed, just today, the Court has intimated that this clear-statement principle is not simply a means of discerning congressional intent.  <em>See Dellmuth v. Muth, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html#232">491 U.

Union Gas Co., ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/1/case.html">491 U. S. 1</a></span>.  Since this case was brought in state court, however, this strict drafting requirement has no application here.  The Eleventh Amendment can hardly be "a consideration," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#67">491 U. S. 67</a></span>, in a suit to which it does not apply.</p>\n<p>That this Court has generated a uniquely daunting requirement of clarity in Eleventh Amendment cases explains why <em>Quern v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html">440 U. S. 332</a></span> (1979), did not decide the question before us today.  Because only the Eleventh Amendment permits use of this clear-statement principle, the holding of <em>Quern v. Jordan</em> that \xc2\xa7 1983 does not abrogate States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity tells us nothing about the meaning of the term "persons" in \xc2\xa7 1983 as a matter of ordinary statutory construction.  <em>Quern\'s</em> conclusion thus does not compel, or even suggest, a particular result today.</p>\n<p>The singularity of this Court\'s approach to statutory interpretation in Eleventh Amendment cases also refutes the Court\'s argument that, given <em>Quern\'s</em> holding, it would make no sense to construe \xc2\xa7 1983 to include States as "persons."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#66">491 U. S. 66</a></span>.  This is so, the Court suggests, because such a construction would permit suits against States in state, but not federal, court, even though a major purpose of Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983 was to provide a federal forum for litigants who had been deprived of their constitutional rights.  <em>See, e.g., Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).  In answering the question whether \xc2\xa7 1983 provides a federal forum for suits against the States themselves, however, one must apply the clear-statement principle reserved for Eleventh Amendment cases.  Since this principle is inapplicable to suits brought in state court, and inapplicable to the question whether States are among those subject to a statute, <em>see Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/279/case.html">411 U.

S. 77</a></p><p> be, different from the answer to the kind of question before us today.  Since the question whether Congress has provided a federal forum for damages suits against the States is answered by applying a uniquely strict interpretive principle, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#75">491 U. S. 75</a></span>, the Court should not pretend that we have, in <em>Quern,</em> answered the question whether Congress intended to provide a federal forum for such suits, and then reason backwards from that "intent" to the conclusion that Congress must not have intended to allow such suits to proceed in state court.</p>\n<p>In short, the only principle of statutory interpretation that permits the Court to avoid a careful and thorough analysis of \xc2\xa7 1983\'s language and history is the clear-statement principle that this Court has come to apply in Eleventh Amendment cases -- a principle that is irrelevant to this state court action.  In my view, a careful and detailed analysis of \xc2\xa7 1983 leads to the conclusion that States are "persons" within the meaning of that statute.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>Although \xc2\xa7 1983 itself does not define the term "person," we are not without a statutory definition of this word.

Thus, we concluded, where nothing in the "context" of a particular statute</p>\n<p>"call[s] for a restricted interpretation of the word \'person,\' the language of that [statute] should <em>prima facie</em> be construed to include \'bodies politic\' among the entities that could be sued."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Both before and after the time when the Dictionary Act and \xc2\xa7 1983 were passed, the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" was understood to include the States.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> J.

Indeed, the very legislators who passed \xc2\xa7 1 referred to States in these terms.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 661-662 (1871) (Sen. Vickers) ("What is a State?  Is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 491 U. S. 79</a></p><p> it not a body politic and corporate?"); <em>id.</em> at 696 (Sen. Edmunds) ("A State is a corporation").</p>\n<p>The reason why States are "bodies politic and corporate" is simple:  just as a corporation is an entity that can act only through its agents, "[t]he State is a political corporate body, can act only through agents, and can command only by laws."  <em>Poindexter v. Greenhow, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/270/case.html#288">114 U. S. 288</a></span>.  <em>See also</em> Black\'s Law Dictionary 159 (5th ed. 1979) ("[B]ody politic or corporate:"  "[a] social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good").  As a "body politic and corporate," a State falls squarely within the Dictionary Act\'s definition of a "person."</p>\n<p>While it is certainly true that the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" referred to private and public corporations, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#69">491 U. S. 69</a></span>, and n. 9, this fact does not draw into question the conclusion that this phrase also applied to the States.  Phrases may, of course, have multiple referents.  Indeed, each and every dictionary cited by the Court accords a broader realm -- one that comfortably, and in most cases explicitly, includes the sovereign -- to this phrase than the Court gives it today.  <em>See</em> 1 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English Jurisprudence 155 (1879) ("[T]he term body politic is often used in a general way, as meaning the state or the sovereign power, or the city government, without implying any distinct express incorporation"); W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 127 (1893) ("[B]ody politic:"  "The governmental, sovereign power:  a city or a State"); Black\'s Law Dictionary 143 (1891) ("[B]ody politic:"  "It is often used, in a rather loose way, to designate the state or nation or sovereign power, or the government of a county or municipality, without distinctly connoting any express and individual corporate charter"); 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 212 (2d ed. 1871) ("[B]ody politic:"  "[a] body to take in succession, framed by <em>policy</em>"; "[p]articularly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 491 U. S. 80</a></p><p> applied, in the old books, to a corporation sole"); <em>id.</em> at 383 ("[C]orporation sole" includes the sovereign in England).</p>\n<p>Because I recognize that both uses of this phrase were deemed valid when \xc2\xa7 1983 and the Dictionary Act were passed, the Court accuses me of "confus[ing] [the] precise definition of this phrase with its use <em>in a rather loose way,\'" "to refer to <em>the</em> state (as opposed to <em>a</em> State)."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#70">491 U. S. 70</a></span>, n. 9, quoting Black, <em>supra,</em> at 143.  It had never occurred to me, however, that only "precise" definitions counted as valid ones.  Where the question we face is what meaning Congress attached to a particular word or phrase, we usually -- and properly -- are loath to conclude that Congress meant to use the word or phrase in a hypertechnical sense unless it said so.  Nor does the Court\'s distinction between "<em>the</em> state" and "<em>a</em> State" have any force.  The suggestion, I take it, is that the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" refers only to nations, rather than to the states within a nation; but then the Court must explain why so many of the sources I have quoted refer to states <em>in addition to</em> nations.  In an opinion so utterly devoted to the rights of the States as sovereigns, moreover, it is surprising indeed to find the Court distinguishing between our sovereign States and our sovereign Nation.\n</em></p>\n<p>In deciding what the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" means, furthermore, I do not see the relevance of the meaning of the term "public corporation."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#69">491 U. S. 69</a></span>-70, n. 9.  That is not the phrase chosen by Congress in the Dictionary Act, and the Court\'s suggestion that this phrase is coterminous with the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" begs the question whether the latter one includes the States.  Nor do I grasp the significance of this Court\'s decision in <em>United States v. Fox,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/315/case.html">94 U. S. 315</a></span> (1877), in which the question was whether the State of New York, by including "persons" and "corporations" within the class of those to whom land could be devised, had intended to authorize devises to the United States.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#69">491 U. S. 69</a></span>-70, n. 9.  Noting that "[t]he question is to be determined by the laws of [New York]," the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 491 U. S. 81</a></p><p> Court held that it would require "an express definition" to hold that the word "persons" included the Federal Government, and that, under state law, the term "corporations" applied only to corporations created under the laws of New York.  94 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/315/case.html#320">94 U. S. 320</a></span>-321.  The pertinence of these state law questions to the issue before us today escapes me.  Not only do we confront an entirely different, <em>federal</em> statute, but we also have an express statement, in the Dictionary Act, that the word "persons" in \xc2\xa7 1 includes "bodies politic and corporate."  <em>See also Pfizer Inc. v. India,</em> 434 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/308/case.html#315">434 U. S. 315</a></span>, n. 15.</p>\n<p>The relevance of the fact that \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, -- the model for \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act -- was passed before the Dictionary Act, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#69">491 U. S. 69</a></span>, similarly eludes me.  Congress chose to use the word "persons" in the 1871 Act even after it had passed the Dictionary Act, presumptively including "bodies politic and corporate" within the category of "persons."  Its decision to do so -- and its failure to indicate in the 1871 Act that the Dictionary Act\'s presumption was not to apply -- demonstrate that Congress did indeed intend "persons" to include bodies politic and corporate.  In addition, the Dictionary Act\'s definition of "persons" by no means dropped from the sky.  Many of the authorities cited above predate both the Dictionary. Act and the 1866 Act, indicating that the word "persons" in 1866 ordinarily would have been thought to include "bodies politic and corporate," with or without the Dictionary Act.</p>\n<p>This last point helps to explain why it is a matter of small importance that the Dictionary Act\'s definition of "persons" as including bodies politic and corporate was retroactively withdrawn when the federal statutes were revised in 1874.  <em>See</em> T. Durant, Report to Joint Committee on Revision of Laws 2 (1873).  Only two months after presumptively designating bodies politic and corporate as "persons," Congress chose the word "persons" for \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act.  For the purpose of determining Congress\' intent in using this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 491 U. S. 82</a></p><p> term, it cannot be decisive that, three years later, it withdrew this presumption.  In fact, both the majority and dissent in <em>Monell</em> emphasized the 1871 version of the Dictionary Act, but neither saw fit even to mention the 1874 revision of this statute.  436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#688">436 U. S. 688</a></span>-689, and nn. 51, 53 (opinion for the Court); <em>id.</em> at 719 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  Even in cases, moreover, where no statutory definition of the word "persons" is available, we have not hesitated to include bodies politic and corporate within that category.  <em>See Stanley v. Schwalby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/508/case.html">147 U. S. 508</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/508/case.html#517">147 U. S. 517</a></span> (1893) ("[T]he word <em>person\' in the statute would include [the States] as a body politic and corporate"); <em>Ohio v. Helvering,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/360/case.html">292 U. S. 360</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/360/case.html#370">292 U. S. 370</a></span> (1934); <em>United States v. Shirey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/255/case.html">359 U. S. 255</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/255/case.html#257">359 U. S. 257</a></span>, n. 2 (1959).\n</em></p>\n<p>Thus, the question before us is whether the presumption that the word "persons" in \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 included bodies politic and corporate -- and hence the States -- is overcome by anything in the statute\'s language and history.  Certainly nothing in the statutory language overrides this presumption.  The statute is explicitly directed at action taken "under color of" state law, and thus supports, rather than refutes, the idea that the "persons" mentioned in the statute include the States.  Indeed, for almost a century -- until <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961) -- it was unclear whether the statute applied at all to action not authorized by the State, and the enduring significance of the first cases construing the Fourteenth Amendment, pursuant to which \xc2\xa7 1 was passed, lies in their conclusion that the prohibitions of this Amendment do not reach private action.  <em>See Civil Rights Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/3/case.html">109 U. S. 3</a></span> (1883).  In such a setting, one cannot reasonably deny the significance of \xc2\xa7 1983\'s explicit focus on state action.</p>\n<p>Unimpressed by such arguments, the Court simply asserts that reading "States" where the statute mentions "persons" would be "decidedly awkward."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#64">491 U. S. 64</a></span>.  The Court does not describe the awkwardness that it perceives, but I take it that its objection is that the under-color-of-law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 491 U. S. 83</a></p><p> requirement would be redundant if States were included in the statute because States necessarily act under color of state law.  But \xc2\xa7 1983 extends as well to natural persons, who do not necessarily so act; in order to ensure that <em>they</em> would be liable only when they did so, the statute needed the under-color-of-law requirement.  The only way to remove the redundancy that the Court sees would.have been to eliminate the catch-all phrase "persons" altogether, and separately describe each category of possible defendants and the circumstances under which they might be liable.  I cannot think of a situation not involving the Eleventh Amendment, however, in which we have imposed such an unforgiving drafting requirement on Congress.</p>\n<p>Taking the example closest to this case, we might have observed in <em>Monell</em> that \xc2\xa7 1983 was clumsily written if it included municipalities, since these, too, may act only under color of state authority.  Nevertheless, we held there that the statute does apply to municipalities.  436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U. S. 690</a></span>.  Similarly, we have construed the statutory term "white persons" to include "<em>corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals,\'" <em>see Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html#666">442 U. S. 666</a></span>, quoting 1 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1, despite the evident awkwardness in doing so.  Indeed, virtually every time we construe the word "person" to include corporate or other artificial entities that are not individual, flesh-and-blood persons, some awkwardness results.  But given cases like <em>Monell</em> and <em>Wilson,</em> it is difficult to understand why mere linguistic awkwardness should control where there is good reason to accept the "awkward" reading of a statute.\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history and background of the statute confirm that the presumption created by the Dictionary Act was not overridden in \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act, and that, even without such a presumption, it is plain that "persons" in the 1871 Act must include the States.  I discussed in detail the legislative history of this statute in my opinion concurring in the judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 491 U. S. 84</a></p><p> in <em>Quern v. Jordan,</em> 440 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html#357">440 U. S. 357</a></span>-365, and I shall not cover that ground again here.  Suffice it to say that, in my view, the legislative history of this provision, though spare, demonstrates that Congress recognized and accepted the fact that the statute was directed at the States themselves.  One need not believe that the statute satisfies this Court\'s heightened clear-statement principle, reserved for Eleventh Amendment cases, in order to conclude that the language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 show that the word "persons" must include the States.</p>\n<p>As to the more general historical background of \xc2\xa7 1, we too easily forget, I think, the circumstances existing in this country when the early civil rights statutes were passed.  "[V]iewed against the events and passions of the time," <em>United States v. Price,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/787/case.html">383 U. S. 787</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/787/case.html#803">383 U. S. 803</a></span> (1966), I have little doubt that \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 included States as "persons."  The following brief description of the Reconstruction period is illuminating:</p>\n<p>"The Civil War had ended in April, 1865.  Relations between Negroes and whites were increasingly turbulent.  Congress had taken control of the entire governmental process in former Confederate States.  It had declared the governments in 10 \'unreconstructed\' States to be illegal, and had set up federal military administrations in their place.  Congress refused to seat representatives from these States until they had adopted constitutions guaranteeing Negro suffrage and had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.  Constitutional conventions were called in 1868.  Six of the 10 States fulfilled Congress\' requirements in 1868, the other four by 1870."</p>\n<p>"For a few years, \'radical\' Republicans dominated the governments of the Southern States, and Negroes played a substantial political role.  But countermeasures were swift and violent.  The Ku Klux Klan was organized by southern whites in 1866, and a similar organization appeared with the romantic title of the Knights of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 491 U. S. 85</a></p><p> White Camellia.  In 1868, a wave of murders and assaults was launched, including assassinations designed to keep Negroes from the polls.  The States themselves were helpless, despite the resort by some of them to extreme measures such as making it legal to hunt down and shoot any disguised man."</p>\n<p>"Within the Congress, pressures mounted in the period between the end of the war and 1870 for drastic measures.  A few months after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on December 6, 1865, Congress, on April 9, 1866, enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. . . .  On June 13, 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed, and it was ratified in July, 1868.  In February, 1869, the Fifteenth Amendment was proposed, and it was ratified in February, 1870.  On May 31, 1870, the Enforcement Act of 1870 was enacted."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/787/case.html#803">383 U. S. 803</a></span>-805 (footnotes omitted).  This was a Congress in the midst of altering the "<em>balance between the States and the Federal Government.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#65">491 U. S. 65</a></span>, quoting <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#242">473 U. S. 242</a></span>.  It was fighting to save the Union, and in doing so, it transformed our federal system.  It is difficult, therefore, to believe that this same Congress did not intend to include States among those who might be liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 for the very deprivations that were threatening this Nation at that time.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>To describe the breadth of the Court\'s holding is to demonstrate its unwisdom.  If States are not "persons" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983, then they may not be sued under that statute regardless of whether they have consented to suit.  Even if, in other words, a State formally and explicitly consented to suits against it in federal or state court, no \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff could proceed against it, because States are not within the statute\'s category of possible defendants. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 491 U. S. 86</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This is indeed an exceptional holding.  Not only does it depart from our suggestion in <em>Alabama v. Pugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/781/case.html">438 U. S. 781</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/781/case.html#782">438 U. S. 782</a></span> (1978), that a State could be a defendant under \xc2\xa7 1983 if it consented to suit, <em>see also Quern v. Jordan,</em> 440 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/332/case.html#340">440 U. S. 340</a></span>, but it also renders ineffective the choices some States have made to permit such suits against them.  <em>See, e.g., Della Grotta v. Rhode Island,</em> 781 F.2d 343 (CA1 1986).  I do not understand what purpose is served, what principle of federalism or comity is promoted, by refusing to give force to a State\'s explicit consent to suit.</p>\n<p>The Court appears to be driven to this peculiar result in part by its view that, "in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983, Congress did not intend to override well established immunities or defenses under the common law."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#67">491 U. S. 67</a></span>.  But the question whether States are "persons" under \xc2\xa7 1983 is separate and distinct from the question whether they may assert a defense of common law sovereign immunity.  In our prior decisions involving common law immunities, we have not held that the existence of an immunity defense excluded the relevant state actor from the category of "persons" liable under \xc2\xa7 1983, <em>see, e.g., Forrester v. White,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/484/219/case.html">484 U. S. 219</a></span> (1988), and it is a mistake to do so today.  Such an approach entrenches the effect of common law immunity even where the immunity itself has been waived.</p>\n<p>For my part, I would reverse the judgment below and remand for resolution of the question whether Michigan would assert common law sovereign immunity in defense to this suit and, if so, whether that assertion of immunity would preclude the suit.</p>\n<p>Given the suggestion in the court below that Michigan enjoys no common law immunity for violations of its own Constitution, <em>Smith v. Department of Public Health,</em> 428 Mich. 540, 641-642, 410 N.W.2d 749, 793-794 (1987) (Boyle, J., concurring) (case below), there is certainly a possibility that that court would hold that the State also lacks immunity against \xc2\xa7 1983 suits for violations of the federal Constitution.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 491 U. S. 87</a></p><p> Moreover, even if that court decided that the State\'s waiver of immunity did not apply to \xc2\xa7 1983 suits, there is a substantial question whether Michigan could so discriminate between virtually identical causes of action only on the ground that one was a state suit and the other a federal one.  <em>Cf. Testa v. Katt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/386/case.html">330 U. S. 386</a></span> (1947); <em>Martinez v.

Finally, even if both of these questions were resolved in favor of an immunity defense, there would remain the question whether it would be reasonable to attribute to Congress an intent to allow States to decide for themselves whether to take cognizance of \xc2\xa7 1983 suits brought against them.  <em>Cf. Martinez, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/277/case.html#284">444 U. S. 284</a></span>, and n. 8; <em>Owen v.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The doctrine of sovereign immunity rests on the fictional premise that the "King can do no wrong." [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Even though the plot to assassinate James I in 1605, the execution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 491 U.

They held his advisors and his agents responsible. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In our administration of \xc2\xa7 1983, we have also relied on fictions to protect the illusion that a sovereign State, absent consent, may not be held accountable for its delicts in federal court.  Under a settled course of decision, in contexts ranging from school desegregation to the provision of public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 491 U. S. 89</a></p><p> assistance benefits to the administration of prison systems and other state facilities, we have held the States liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 for their constitutional violations through the artifice of naming a public officer as a nominal party.  Once one strips away the Eleventh Amendment overlay applied to actions in federal court, it is apparent that the Court in these cases has treated the State as the real party in interest both for the purposes of granting prospective and ancillary relief and of denying retroactive relief.  When suit is brought in state court, where the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable, it follows that the State can be named directly as a party under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>An official-capacity suit is the typical way in which we have held States responsible for their duties under federal law.  Such a suit, we have explained, "<em>generally represent[s] only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\'"  <em>Kentucky v.

Our holdings that a \xc2\xa7 1983 action can be brought against state officials in their official capacity for constitutional violations properly recognize and are faithful to that profound mandate.  If prospective relief can be awarded against state officials under \xc2\xa7 1983 and the State is the real party in interest in such suits, the State must be a "person" which can be held liable under \xc2\xa7 1983.  No other conclusion is available.  Eleventh Amendment principles may limit the State\'s capacity to be sued as such in federal court.  <em>See Alabama v. Pugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/781/case.html">438 U. S. 781</a></span> (1978).  But since those principles are not applicable to suits in state court, <em>see Thiboutot, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#9">448 U. S. 9</a></span>, n. 7; <em>Nevada v. Hall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/410/case.html">440 U. S. 410</a></span> (1979), there is no need to resort to the fiction of an official-capacity suit, and the State may and should be named directly as a defendant in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes, however, that "a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under \xc2\xa7 1983," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html#71">491 U. S. 71</a></span>, n. 10, while that same party sued in the same official capacity is not a person when the plaintiff seeks monetary relief.  It cites in support of this proposition cases such as <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html">Osborn v. Bank of United States,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), in which the Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, held that an action against a state auditor to recover taxes illegally collected did not constitute an action against the State.  This line of authority, the Court states, "would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 491 U.

S. 71</a></span>, n. 10.</p>\n<p>On the Court\'s supposition, the question would be whether the complaint against a state official states a claim for the type of relief sought, not whether it will have an impact on the state treasury.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/26/110/case.html">26 U.

At least for actions in state court, as to which there could be no constitutional reason to look to the effect on the State, <em>see Edelman v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html">415 U. S. 651</a></span> (1974), the Court\'s analysis would support actions for the recovery of chattel and real property against state officials, both of which were well known in the 19th century.  <em>See Poindexter v. Greenhow,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/270/case.html">114 U. S. 270</a></span> (1884); <em>United States v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/196/case.html">106 U. S. 196</a></span> (1882).  Although the conclusion that a state officer sued for damages in his or her official capacity is not a "person" under \xc2\xa7 1983 would not quite follow, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] it might nonetheless be permissible to assume that the 1871 Congress did not contemplate an action for damages payable not by the officer personally, but by the State.</p>\n<p>The Court having constructed an edifice for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment on the theory that the State is always the real party in interest in a \xc2\xa7 1983 official-capacity action against a state officer, I would think the majority would be impelled to conclude that the State is a "person" under \xc2\xa7 1983.  As JUSTICE BRENNAN has demonstrated, there is also a compelling textual argument that States are persons under \xc2\xa7 1983.  In addition, the Court\'s construction draws an illogical distinction between wrongs committed by county or municipal officials on the one hand, and those committed by state officials, on the other.  Finally, there is no necessity to  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 491 U. S. 94</a></p><p> import into this question of statutory construction doctrine created to protect the fiction that one sovereign cannot be sued in the courts of another sovereign.  Aside from all of these reasons, the Court\'s holding that a State is not a person under \xc2\xa7 1983 departs from a long line of judicial authority based on exactly that premise.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"A very common phenomenon, and one very familiar to the student of history, is this.  The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula.  In the course of centuries, the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains.  The reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it is to be accounted for.  Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career.

In the United States as well, at the time of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, actions against agents of the sovereign were the means by which the State, despite its own immunity, was required to obey the law.  <em>See, e.g., Poindexter v.
