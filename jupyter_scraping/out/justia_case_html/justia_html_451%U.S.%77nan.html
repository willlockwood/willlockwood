S. 79</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether an employer held liable to its female employees for backpay because collectively bargained wage differentials were found to violate the Equal Pay Act of 1963 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] has a federal statutory or common law right to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 451 U. S. 80</a></p><p> contribution from unions that allegedly bear at least partial responsibility for the statutory violations.</p>\n<p>The relevant facts are alleged in the complaint filed by the petitioner, Northwest Airlines, Inc., against the respondent unions, the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) and the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Continuously from 1947 through 1974, petitioner paid higher wages to its male cabin attendants, who were classified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 451 U. S. 81</a></p><p> as pursers, than to its female cabin attendants, who were classified as stewardesses.  During that period, both the male and the female cabin attendants were represented by a union -- TWU from 1961 to 1971 and ALPA thereafter [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] -- and their wages were fixed by collective bargaining agreements negotiated and executed in response to union demands.</p>\n<p>In 1970, Mary Laffey, a female cabin attendant employed by petitioner, commenced a class action against petitioner challenging the legality of the wage differential between pursers and stewardesses. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  On November 12, 1973, after a full trial, the District Court issued an opinion in which it found that the two positions required equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and were performed under similar working conditions.  Accordingly, the court held that petitioner had violated the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff class.  <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</em> 366 F.Supp. 763 (1973). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Unless that judgment is reversed or modified, petitioner </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 451 U. S. 82</a></p><p> will be required to pay in excess of $2 million in backpay, damages, and interest to the members of the Laffey plaintiff class. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>After the entry of judgment against it, petitioner filed appropriate motions in the <em>Laffey</em> case, asserting claims for contribution and indemnification against TWU and ALPA. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Those motions were denied as untimely, and the Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling.  <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</em> 185 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 369-370, 567 F.2d 429, 476-478.  Promptly thereafter, petitioner commenced this separate action.  The complaint prayed that each union be adjudged liable to pay a proportion of any monetary liability finally assessed against petitioner in the Laffey litigation.  The unions moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p>As the District Court interpreted the pleadings, petitioner contended that it had an implied cause of action against the unions under the Equal Pay Act for causing it to discriminate against the Laffey class, or, in the alternative, a federal common law right to contribution from the unions for a share of its Equal Pay Act monetary liability.  Petitioner\'s claim for reimbursement for its Title VII monetary liability was based solely on a federal common law right to contribution.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2b-3b.  The District Court held that, because the Equal Pay Act clearly was not enacted for the special </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 451 U. S. 83</a></p><p> benefit of employers, petitioner could not rely upon an implied private cause of action for contribution under that statute.  The court also concluded that the Act did not afford employees any express or implied right of action against their unions; because it found that unions and employers do not share common liability to employees under the Equal Pay Act, the District Court held that there is no federal common law right to contribution for liability under that statute. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court reached a different conclusion with respect to the claim for contribution for petitioner\'s Title VII monetary liability.  It found that the allegations of the complaint satisfied the two principal elements of a common law right to contribution:  (1) common liability and (2) the party seeking contribution has been required to pay more than its just share of the award.  <em>Id.</em> at 10b.  The court answered what it described as the "more difficult question" whether there is a right to contribution under federal law by noting a modern trend of federal court decisions favoring contribution, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and by finding that the policy of the statute would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 451 U. S. 84</a></p><p> be served by allowing contribution.  Assuming, without deciding, that contribution might be denied for an intentional wrong, the court denied the unions\' motions to dismiss, holding</p>\n<p>only that there is a federal common law right to contribution for monetary liability imposed under Title VII, at least under some circumstances, and it will reach the questions as to the precise parameter of this right when the pertinent facts have been developed and properly placed before the Court.</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 18b. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 451 U. S. 85</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The unions took an interlocutory appeal from the Title VII holding, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and petitioner appealed the Equal Pay Act holding. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the claim for contribution based on petitioner\'s liability under the Equal Pay Act, reasoning that such a claim would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme prescribing three, and only three, modes of enforcement. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach the Title VII issue.  Noting that, on appeal, the unions had asserted for the first time that petitioner\'s Title VII contribution claim was barred by laches, the court remanded to the District Court with instructions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 451 U. S. 86</a></p><p> to determine the laches question, explaining that it might thereby become unnecessary to decide the hard question concerning contribution for Title VII liability.  196 U.S.App.D.C. 443, 449, 606 F.2d 1350, 1356 (1979).</p>\n<p>Unlike the Court of Appeals, we think the basic legal questions raised by the motions to dismiss petitioner\'s contribution claims are ripe for decision. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The importance of these questions led us to grant certiorari.  447 U.S. 920.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>We first put to one side certain questions that we need not address.  We shall then discuss the two quite different theories that might support petitioner\'s claimed right to contribution</p>\n<p>At common law there was no right to contribution among joint tortfeasors. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In most American jurisdictions, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 451 U. S. 87</a></p><p> that rule has been changed either by statute or by judicial decision. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Typically, a right to contribution is recognized when two or more persons are liable to the same plaintiff for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 451 U. S. 88</a></p><p> the same injury and one of the joint tortfeasors has paid more than his fair share of the common liability. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Recognition of the right reflects the view that, when two or more persons share responsibility for a wrong, it is inequitable to require one to pay the entire cost of reparation, and it is sound policy to deter all wrongdoers by reducing the likelihood that any will entirely escape liability. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  In this case, we assume that all of the elements of a typical contribution claim are established.  This means that we assume that the plaintiffs in the <em>Laffey</em> litigation could have recovered from either the union or the employer, under both the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] and that it is unfair to  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 451 U. S. 89</a></p><p> require petitioner to pay the entire judgment.  Furthermore, although the adversaries disagree with respect to whether recognition of a right to contribution would undermine or advance the policies of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII -- and, indeed, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has staunchly argued both sides of that policy question at different stages of this litigation [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] -- we assume that the policy considerations favor the recognition of the right.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 451 U. S. 90</a></p><p> And, as argued by petitioner, we assume that the respondent unions in this case, as well as other unions in other industries, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] bear significant responsibility for discriminatory practices that these statutes were designed to prohibit.  Finally, we assume that there are circumstances in which an employer may be a "person aggrieved" by union conduct that would be remediable after a timely charge is filed against the union under \xc2\xa7 706(b) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b). [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  None of these assumptions, however, provides a sufficient basis for recognizing the right petitioner is asserting in this proceeding.</p>\n<p>That right may have been created in either of two ways.  First, it may have been created by statute when Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act or Title VII.  Even though Congress did not expressly create a contribution remedy, if its intent to do so may fairly be inferred from either or both statutes, an implied cause of action for contribution could be recognized on the basis of the analysis used in cases such as <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>, <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a></span>, and <em>Universities Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/754/case.html">450 U. S. 754</a></span>.  Second, a cause of action for contribution may have become a part of the federal common law through the exercise of judicial power to fashion appropriate remedies for unlawful conduct.  <em>See, e.g., Kohr v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc.,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 451 U. S. 91</a></p><p> 504 F.2d 400 (CA7 1974), <em>cert. denied,</em> 421 U.S. 978.  For somewhat different reasons, we reject both theories.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In determining whether a federal statute that does not expressly provide for a particular private right of action nonetheless implicitly created that right, our task is one of statutory construction.  <em>See Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html">442 U. S. 560</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#568">442 U. S. 568</a></span>.  The ultimate question in cases such as this is whether Congress intended to create the private remedy -- for example, a right to contribution -- that the plaintiff seeks to invoke.  <em>See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/case.html">444 U. S. 11</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/111/case.html#116">444 U. S. 116</a></span>; <em>Universities Research Assn., Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/754/case.html#770">450 U. S. 770</a></span>.  Factors relevant to this inquiry are the language of the statute itself, its legislative history, the underlying purpose and structure of the statutory scheme, and the likelihood that Congress intended to supersede or to supplement existing state remedies.  <em>See Cort v. Ash, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span>; <em>Cannon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#689">441 U. S. 689</a></span>-709.</p>\n<p>In matters of statutory construction, it is appropriate to begin with the language of the statute itself.  <em>See Touche Ross &amp; Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#568">442 U. S. 568</a></span>; <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html">442 U. S. 330</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html#337">442 U. S. 337</a></span>.  Neither the Equal Pay Act nor Title VII expressly creates a right to contribution in favor of employers.  This omission, although significant, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] is not dispositive if, among other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 451 U. S. 92</a></p><p> things, the language of the statutes indicates that they were enacted for the special benefit of a class of which petitioner is a member.  <em>See Cannon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#689">441 U. S. 689</a></span>.  However, as the District Court correctly perceived, it cannot possibly be said that employers are members of the class for whose especial benefit either the Equal Pay Act or Title VII was enacted.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 5b. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  To the contrary, both statutes are expressly directed against employers; Congress intended in these statutes to regulate their conduct for the benefit of employees. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  In light of this fact, petitioner "can scarcely lay claim to the status of <em>beneficiary\' whom Congress considered in need of protection."  <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/1/case.html">430 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/1/case.html#37">430 U. S. 37</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>Even if we focus upon the isolated provisions in each statute that arguably were intended to provide special protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 451 U. S. 93</a></p><p> for employers, [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] the same result follows.  For those provisions, construed most favorably to petitioner, could, at most, provide a basis for implying a remedy for harm to an employer caused by union wrongdoing.  Such a remedy for a violation of the employer\'s rights would be entirely different from a right to compel the union to share the responsibility for a joint violation of a third party\'s rights.  Clearly, the language of neither statute supports implication of a right to contribution in favor of employers against unions. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The structure of the statutes similarly counsels against recognition of the implied right petitioner advocates in this case.  The Equal Pay Act and Title VII establish comprehensive programs designed to eliminate certain varieties of employment discrimination.  The statutes make express provision for private enforcement in certain carefully defined circumstances, and provide for enforcement at the instance of the Federal Government in other circumstances. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The comprehensive character of the remedial scheme expressly fashioned by Congress strongly evidences an intent not to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 451 U. S. 94</a></p><p> authorize additional remedies. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  It is, of course, not within our competence as federal judges to amend these comprehensive enforcement schemes by adding to them another private remedy not authorized by Congress.</p>\n<p>Finally, we conclude that the legislative histories of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII provide no support for petitioner\'s position. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  As the parties recognize, the legislative history of neither statute contains any reference, adverse or favorable, to contribution.  Of course, such legislative silence is often encountered in implied-right-of-action cases; it is to be expected that "the legislative history of a statute that does not expressly create or deny a private remedy will typically be equally silent or ambiguous on the question."  <em>Cannon,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#694">441 U.

But unless this congressional intent can be inferred from the language of the statute, the statutory structure, or some other source, the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist.  In this case, we have been unable to discover any manifestation of an intent on the part of Congress to create a right to contribution in favor of employers under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.  Accordingly, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 451 U. S. 95</a></p><p> we hold that there is no implied right to contribution under those statutes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although it is much too late to deny that there is a significant body of federal law that has been fashioned by the federal judiciary in the common law tradition, it remains true that federal courts, unlike their state counterparts, are courts of limited jurisdiction that have not been vested with open-ended lawmaking powers.  <em>See United States v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/301/case.html">332 U.

Broadly worded constitutional and statutory provisions necessarily have been given concrete meaning and application by a process of case-by-case judicial decision in the common law tradition.  The Court also has recognized a responsibility, in the absence of legislation, to fashion federal common law in cases raising issues of uniquely federal concern, such as the definition of rights or duties of the United States, [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] or the resolution of interstate controversies. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  However, we consistently have emphasized that the federal lawmaking power is vested in the legislative, not the judicial, branch of government; therefore, federal common law is "subject to the paramount authority of Congress."  <em>New Jersey v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/336/case.html">283 U. S. 336</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/348/case.html">283 U.

We consistently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 451 U.

[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Because "the Congress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/16/case.html#20">374 U.

Even in admiralty, however, where the federal judiciary\'s lawmaking power may well be at its strongest, it is our duty to respect the will of Congress. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>Pursuant to our authority to fashion flexible and equitable remedies in admiralty, <em>see United States v.

Fritz Kopke, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/106/case.html">417 U. S. 106</a></span>.  In that case, relying upon ancient admiralty doctrine, we held that a shipowner may obtain contribution from another tortfeasor jointly responsible for causing injury to a longshoreman.  However, contrary to petitioner\'s argument and the understanding of some lower federal courts, [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] <em>Cooper Stevedoring</em> did not recognize a general federal right to contribution, and no such general federal right has been recognized in any other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 451 U.

[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Our approval of contribution in <em>Cooper Stevedoring</em> was based on traditional admiralty doctrine [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>] and on the power of the federal judiciary to fashion rules of law in admiralty.  Neither of the predicates for that decision is applicable in the present context.</p>\n<p>The liability of petitioner for discriminating against its female cabin attendants is entirely a creature of federal statute.  In almost any statutory scheme, there may be a need for judicial interpretation of ambiguous or incomplete provisions.  But the authority to construe a statute is fundamentally different from the authority to fashion a new rule or to provide a new remedy which Congress has decided not to adopt.  <em>Cf. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/case.html">436 U.

The presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.  Both the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are such statutes.  The judiciary may not, in the face of such comprehensive legislative schemes, fashion new remedies that might upset carefully considered legislative programs.

Although equitable considerations strongly supported a nonliteral reading of the statutory provisions regarding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 451 U.

In this case, as in <em>Mohasco,</em> a favorable reaction to the equitable considerations supporting petitioner\'s contribution claim is not a sufficient reason for enlarging on the remedial provisions contained in these carefully considered statutes.

The traditional American rule, originating in the English case of <em>Merryweather v. Nixan,</em> was that there was no right to contribution between joint tortfeasors.

First, under section 216(a) of title 29, U.S. Code, \'any person\' who wilfully violates the Act may be subject to criminal penalties.  Under section 216(c), the Secretary of Labor may bring suit to recover money owing \'to any employee or employees.\'  Finally, section 216(b) of title 29 permits suits by employees against \'any employer\' who violates the Act.  The statutory scheme of enforcement is comprehensive, and, by omission, it insulates unions from suits by employees.  This statutory protection would certainly be frustrated by a declaration that an <em>employer</em> could recover from a union once that employer had been found liable to its employees.  Of course, we need not -- and do not -- definitely resolve the issue of an employee\'s right to sue a union under the Act.  We hold only that the likelihood of the implication of such a right is sufficiently remote to preclude the creation of a cause of action against a union for contribution or indemnification.

First, we assume, as alleged in the complaint, that the unions are, in fact, at least partially responsible for the Equal Pay Act and Title VII violations established in the <em>Laffey</em> litigation.  Second, we assume that the <em>Laffey</em> plaintiffs, if they had so chosen, could have asserted a claim for monetary relief against their unions under both the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.  Title VII expressly provides for such private actions.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e-5(f), 2000e-5(g).  However, the Equal Pay Act does not expressly create such a right of action, and the lower federal courts have generally refused to find that the Act implicitly created this right.  <em>See, e.g., Tuma v. American Can Co.,</em> 367 F.Supp. 1178 (NJ 1973).  <em>Cf. Hodgson v. Sagner, Inc.,</em> 326 F.Supp. 371 (Md.1971), <em>aff\'d,</em> 462 F.2d 180 (CA4 1972).  The Court of Appeals in this case relied upon the uncertain availability of such a remedy under the Equal Pay Act as a basis for rejecting petitioner\'s claim for contribution.  196 U.S.App.D.C. at 447-449, 606 F.2d at 1354-1356.  The availability of this implied remedy, however, is relevant primarily to the question whether the elements of a contribution claim have been established; if no right to contribution exists at all, it is irrelevant that the elements of a traditional contribution claim may or may not have been established in this case.  Because we conclude that no right to contribution exists under either the statute or the federal common law, we need not decide whether the elements of a contribution claim have been established in this case.  Therefore, we need not and do not decide the question whether employees have an implied right of action for backpay against their unions for violations of the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The EEOC filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae</em> in the Court of Appeals arguing as follows:</p>\n<p>"Recognizing a right to contribution for Title VII liability against a person who was not named in an EEOC charge is fully consistent with the substantive and remedial policies of the statute. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  Permitting a party to assert a contribution claim against another who has violated the Title, where that person was not named in a charge through inadvert[e]nce or design, manifestly serves the primary, prophylactic purpose of Title VII."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"It cannot be inferred that claims for contribution constitute an exception to this policy, because there is no necessary inconsistency between the statutory scheme of Title VII and the assertion of a right to contribution for Title VII liability.  This is because an employer seeking contribution is not asserting that it has been injured by conduct unlawful under the statute, but rather it is asserting an equitable claim to reimbursement, enforced at common law, from another wrongdoer who shares common liability."</p>\n<p>Brief for EEOC as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in No. 78-1056 (CADC), pp. 114.  In this Court, however, the EEOC argues as follows:</p>\n<p>"Contribution would undermine the policies, and interfere with enforcement, of the Equal Pay Act. . . .  For somewhat different reasons, contribution would undermine the policies, and interfere with enforcement, of Title VII."</p>\n<p>Brief for United States and EEOC as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Steelworkers v.

Thus, at least in these instances, when Congress wanted to provide a right to contribution, it did so expressly.</p>\n<p>A number of federal courts have recognized an implied right to contribution under the securities laws where the underlying liability resulted from an implied private right of action.  These courts have reasoned that, because Congress expressly created a right to contribution to correspond to certain express civil remedies, contribution should also be permitted when liability is based on an implied civil remedy.  <em>See, e.g., Heizer Corp. v. Ross,</em> 601 F.2d 330 (CA7 1979); <em>Globus, Inc. v. Law Research Service, Inc.,</em> 318 F.Supp. 955 (SDNY 1970), <em>aff\'d,</em> 442 F.2d 1346 (CA2 1971), <em>cert. denied,</em> 404 U.S. 941.  Whatever the merit of this reasoning, a question we do not now address, these decisions provide no support for petitioner in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected the District Court\'s literal application of the first <em>Cort v. Ash</em> factor, finding it inappropriate for evaluation of a contribution claim.  196 U.S.App.D.C. at 447, 606 F.2d at 1354.  Rather than focusing on the rights conferred upon employers by the Equal Pay Act, the court reasoned that the proper inquiry was to determine whether employees could bring suit against their unions under this statute.  Viewed in this light, the first <em>Cort</em> factor was easily satisfied in this case; employees clearly were within the class for whose especial benefit the Equal Pay Act was enacted.  196 U.S.App.D.C. at 447-448, 606 F.2d at 1354-1355.  However, this analysis confuses the question whether the elements of a contribution claim -- in particular, common liability -- are established in a given case with the question whether Congress intended that contribution should be available under any circumstances.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F20" name="T20">n</a> 20, <em>supra.</em>  The Court of Appeals erred in this case because it failed to focus on whether the party seeking to invoke the implied remedy is a member of a class that Congress intended to benefit.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, inasmuch as petitioner was found guilty in the <em>Laffey</em> litigation of discrimination in violation of these statutes, it is a member of the <em>precise</em> class Congress intended to regulate.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 3 of the Equal Pay Act provides:</p>\n<p>"No labor organization, or its agents, representing employees of an employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 206(d)(2).</p>\n<p>Section 703(c)(3) of Title VII provides:</p>\n<p>"(c) . . .
