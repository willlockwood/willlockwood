Each dam impounds water, which is then run through turbines and returned to the riverbed, passing around a section of the river.  Under protest, Warren applied for water quality certifications from respondent Maine Board of Environmental Protection pursuant to \xc2\xa7401 of the Clean Water Act, which requires state approval of \xe2\x80\x9cany activity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhich may result in any discharge into the [Nation\xe2\x80\x99s] navigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  FERC licensed the dams subject to compliance with those certifications, which require Warren to maintain a minimum stream flow and to allow passage for certain fish and eels.  After losing state administrative appeals, Warren filed suit in a state court, which rejected Warren\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its dams do not result in a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7401.  The State Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> Because a dam raises a potential for a discharge, \xc2\xa7401 is triggered and state certification is required.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a) The Clean Water Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge,\xe2\x80\x9d but provides that the term \xe2\x80\x9cwhen used without qualification includes a discharge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(16).  But \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d is presumably broader, else superfluous, and since it is neither defined nor a term of art, it should be construed \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 476.  When applied to water, discharge commonly means \xe2\x80\x9cflowing or issuing out,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 742.  This Court has consistently intended that meaning in prior water cases, including the only case focused on \xc2\xa7401, <em>PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cty.</em> v. <em>Washington Dept. of Ecology,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/700/index.html">511 U. S. 700</a>, in which no one questioned that the discharge of water from a dam fell within \xc2\xa7401\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  The Environmental Protection Agency and FERC have also regularly read \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d to cover releases from hydroelectric dams.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b) Warren\xe2\x80\x99s three arguments for avoiding this common reading are unavailing.  The canon <em>noscitur a sociis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c</em>a word is known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U. S. 561</a>, 575\xe2\x80\x94does not apply here.  Warren claims that since \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d is keeping company with \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d defined as adding one or more pollutants, see \xc2\xa71362(12), discharge standing alone must also require the addition of something foreign to the water.  This argument seems to assume that pairing a broad statutory term with a narrow one shrinks the broad one, but there is no such general usage of language this way.  Warren also relies on <em>South Fla. Water Management Dist.</em> v. <em>Miccosukee Tribe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/95/index.html">541 U. S. 95</a>, but that case is not on point.  It addressed \xc2\xa7402, not \xc2\xa7401, and the two sections are not interchangeable, as they serve different purposes and use different language to reach them.  Thus, that something must be added in order to implicate \xc2\xa7402 does not explain what suffices for a discharge under \xc2\xa7401.  Finally, the Clean Water Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, if it means anything, goes against Warren\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c) Warren\xe2\x80\x99s arguments against reading \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d in its common sense also miss the forest for the trees.  Congress passed the Clean Water Act to \xe2\x80\x9crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(a), the \xe2\x80\x9cnational goal\xe2\x80\x9d being to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cwater quality [providing] for the protection and propagation of fish \xe2\x80\xa6 and \xe2\x80\xa6 for recreation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71251(a)(2).  To do this, the Act deals with \xe2\x80\x9cpollution\xe2\x80\x9d generally, see \xc2\xa71251(b), which it defines as \xe2\x80\x9cthe man-made or man-induced alteration of the [water\xe2\x80\x99s] chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71362(19).  Because the alteration of water quality as thus defined is a risk inherent in limiting river flow and releasing water through turbines, changes in the river\xe2\x80\x99s flow, movement, and circulation fall within a State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate legislative business.  State certifications under \xc2\xa7401 are essential in the scheme to preserve state authority to address the broad range of pollution.  Reading \xc2\xa7401 to give \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d its common and ordinary meaning preserves the state authority apparently intended.

If so, a federal license under \xc2\xa7401 of the Clean Water Act requires state certification that water protection laws will not be violated.  We hold that a dam does raise a potential for a discharge, and state approval is needed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Presumpscot River runs through southern Maine from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay, and in the course of its 25 miles petitioner, S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Company, operates several hydropower dams to generate electricity for its paper mill.  Each dam creates a pond, from which water funnels into a \xe2\x80\x9cpower canal,\xe2\x80\x9d through turbines, and back to the riverbed, passing around a section of the river just below the impoundment. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that since 1935, Warren has needed a license to operate the dams, currently within the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Federal Power Act.  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7817(1), 792; see also Public Utility Act of 1935, \xc2\xa7210, 49 Stat. 846.  FERC grants these licenses for periods up to 50 years, 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7799, after a review that looks to environmental issues as well as the rising demand for power, \xc2\xa7797(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over 30 years ago, Congress enacted a specific provision for licensing an activity that could cause a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d into navigable waters; a license is conditioned on a certification from the State in which the discharge may originate that it will not violate certain water quality standards, including those set by the State\xe2\x80\x99s own laws.  See Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, \xc2\xa7103, 84 Stat. 108.  Today, this requirement can be found in \xc2\xa7401 of the Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 877, codified at 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341: \xe2\x80\x9cAny applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity \xe2\x80\xa6 which may result in any discharge into the navigable water[s] shall provide the licensing or permitting agency a certification from the State in which the discharge originates \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71341(a)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAny certification provided under this section shall set forth any effluent limitations and other limitations, and monitoring requirements necessary to assure that any applicant for a Federal license or permit will comply with [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311, 1312, 1316, and 1317] and with any other appropriate requirement of State law set forth in such certification, and shall become a condition on any Federal license or permit subject to the provisions of this section.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xc2\xa71341(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, Warren sought to renew federal licenses for five of its hydroelectric dams.  It applied for water quality certifications from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (the state agency responsible for what have come to be known as \xe2\x80\x9c401 state certifications\xe2\x80\x9d), but it filed its application under protest, claiming that its dams do not result in any \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge into\xe2\x80\x9d the river triggering application of \xc2\xa7401.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Maine agency issued certifications that required Warren to maintain a minimum stream flow in the bypassed portions of the river and to allow passage for various migratory fish and eels.  When FERC eventually licensed the five dams, it did so subject to the Maine conditions, and Warren continued to deny any need of \xc2\xa7401 state certification.  After appealing unsuccessfully to Maine\xe2\x80\x99s administrative appeals tribunal, the Board of Environmental Protection, Warren filed this suit in the State\xe2\x80\x99s Cumberland County Superior Court.  That court rejected Warren\xe2\x80\x99s argument that its dams do not result in discharges, and the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine affirmed.  <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Environmental Protection, </em>2005 ME 27, 868 A.\xc2\xa02d 210.  We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ___ (2005), and now affirm as well.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispute turns on the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge,\xe2\x80\x9d the key to the state certification requirement under \xc2\xa7401.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Act has no definition of the term, but provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98discharge\xe2\x80\x99 when used without qualification includes a discharge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(16).  It does define \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of pollutants,\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(12).  But \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d presumably is broader, else superfluous, and since it is neither defined in the statute nor a term of art, we are left to construe it \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Oregon Natural Resources Council,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/360/index.html">490 U.

S. 700</a> (1994).  At issue in <em>PUD No. 1 </em>was the State of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose minimum stream flow rates on a hydroelectric dam, and in posing the question presented, the Court said this:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no dispute that petitioners were required to obtain a certification from the State pursuant to \xc2\xa7401.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> EPA, Water Quality Standards Handbook \xc2\xa77.6.3, p.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310 (2d ed. 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cEPA has identified five Federal permits and/or licenses that authorize activities that may result in a discharge to the waters[, including] licenses required for hydroelectric projects issued under the Federal Power Act\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>FPL Energy Maine Hydro LLC, </em>111 FERC \xc2\xb661,104, P.\xc2\xa061,505 (2005) (rejecting, in a recent adjudication, the argument that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cused the term \xe2\x80\x98discharge\xe2\x80\x99 as nothing more than a shorthand expression for \xe2\x80\x98discharge of a pollutant or pollutants\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Warren is, of course, entirely correct in cautioning us that because neither the EPA nor FERC has formally settled the definition, or even set out agency reasoning, these expressions of agency understanding do not command deference from this Court<em>.  </em>See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon,</em> 546 U.

We find none availing.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first involves an interpretive canon we think is out of place here.  The canon, <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>reminds us that \xe2\x80\x9ca word is known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U. S. 561</a>, 575 (1995), and is invoked when a string of statutory terms raises the implication that the \xe2\x80\x9cwords grouped in a list should be given related meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dole</em> v. <em>Steelworkers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/26/index.html">494 U. S. 26</a>, 36 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Beecham</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a>, 371 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cThat several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Warren claims that the canon applies to \xc2\xa7502(16) of the Clean Water Act, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98discharge\xe2\x80\x99 when used without qualification includes a discharge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(16).  Warren emphasizes that the \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[d]\xe2\x80\x9d terms, pollutant discharges, are themselves defined to require an \xe2\x80\x9caddition\xe2\x80\x9d of pollutants to water.  \xc2\xa71362(12).  Since \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d pure and simple is keeping company with \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d defined as adding one or more pollutants, Warren says \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone must require the addition of something foreign to the water into which the discharge flows.  And because the release of water from the dams adds nothing to the river that was not there above the dams, Warren concludes that water flowing out of the turbines cannot be a discharge into the river.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem with Warren\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that it purports to extrapolate a common feature from what amounts to a single item (discharge of a pollutant plus the plural variant involving more than one pollutant).  See <em>Beecham, supra, </em>at 371.  The argument seems to assume that pairing a broad statutory term with a narrow one shrinks the broad one, but there is no such general usage; giving one example does not convert express inclusion into restrictive equation, and <em>noscitur a sociis</em> is no help absent some sort of gathering with a common feature to extrapolate.  It should also go without saying that uncritical use of interpretive rules is especially risky in making sense of a complicated statute like the Clean Water Act, where technical definitions are worked out with great effort in the legislative process.

But that case is not on point.  <em>Miccosukee </em>addressed \xc2\xa7402 of the Clean Water Act, not \xc2\xa7401, and the two sections are not interchangeable, as they serve different purposes and use different language to reach them.  Section 401 recast pre-existing law and was meant to \xe2\x80\x9ccontinu[e] the authority of the State \xe2\x80\xa6 to act to deny a permit and thereby prevent a Federal license or permit from issuing to a discharge source within such State.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x93911, at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  But it contrasts with \xc2\xa7401 in its more specific focus.  It establishes what Congress called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, requiring a permit for the \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of any pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d into the navigable waters of the United States, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71342(a).  The triggering statutory term here is not the word \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d alone, but \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase made narrower by its specific definition requiring an \xe2\x80\x9caddition\xe2\x80\x9d of a pollutant to the water.  \xc2\xa71362(12).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in <em>Miccosukee </em>was whether a pump between a canal and an impoundment produced a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7402, see 541 U. S., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103, and the Court accepted the shared view of the parties that if two identified volumes of water are \xe2\x80\x9csimply two parts of the same water body, pumping water from one into the other cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x98addition\xe2\x80\x99 of pollutants,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 109.  <em>Miccosukee </em>was thus concerned only with whether an \xe2\x80\x9caddition\xe2\x80\x9d had been made (phosphorous being the substance in issue) as required by the definition of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d; it did not matter under \xc2\xa7402 whether pumping the water produced a discharge without any addition.  In sum, the understanding that something must be added in order to implicate \xc2\xa7402 does not explain what suffices for a discharge under \xc2\xa7401.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Warren\xe2\x80\x99s third argument for avoiding the common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d relies on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, but we think that if the history means anything it actually goes against Warren\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Warren suggests that the word \xe2\x80\x9cincludes\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d should not be read with any spacious connotation, because the word was simply left on the books inadvertently after a failed attempt to deal specifically with \xe2\x80\x9cthermal discharges.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Warren describes it, several Members of Congress recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cheat is not as harmful as what most of us view as \xe2\x80\x98pollutants,\xe2\x80\x99 because it dissipates quickly in most bodies of receiving waters,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93\xe2\x80\x931, p.\xc2\xa0273 (1973) (remarks of Cong. Clark), and they proposed to regulate thermal discharges less stringently than others.  They offered an amendment to exclude thermal discharges from the requirements under \xc2\xa7402, but they also wanted to ensure that thermal discharges remained within the scope of \xc2\xa7401 and so sought to include them expressly in the general provision covering \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 1069\xe2\x80\x931070, 1071.  The proposed definition read, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98discharge\xe2\x80\x99 when used without qualification includes a discharge of a pollutant, a discharge of pollutants, and a thermal discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1071<em>.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, Congress omitted the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthermal discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d and settled on the definition we have today.  See Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, \xc2\xa7502(16), 86 Stat. 887.  Warren reasons that once Congress abandoned the special treatment for thermal pollutants, it merely struck the words \xe2\x80\x9cthermal discharge\xe2\x80\x9d from 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(16) and carelessly left in the word \xe2\x80\x9cincludes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, Warren argues, there is no reason to assume that describing \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d as including certain acts was meant to extend the reach of \xc2\xa7401 beyond acts of the kind specifically mentioned;[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the terminology of \xc2\xa7401 simply reflects a failed effort to narrow the scope of \xc2\xa7402.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is what might be called a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  We will assume that Warren is entirely correct about the impetus behind the failed attempt to rework the scope of pollutant discharge under \xc2\xa7402.  It is simply speculation, though, to say that the word \xe2\x80\x9cincludes\xe2\x80\x9d was left in the description of a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d by mere inattention, and for reasons given in Part IV of this opinion it is implausible speculation at that.  But if we confine our view for a moment strictly to the drafting history, the one thing clear is that if Congress had left \xe2\x80\x9cthermal discharge\xe2\x80\x9d as an included subclass of a \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(16), Warren would have a stronger noscitur a sociis </em>argument.  For a thermal discharge adds something, the pollutant heat, see n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>.  Had the list of examples of discharge been lengthened to include thermal discharges, there would have been at least a short series with the common feature of addition.  As it stands, however, the only thing the legislative history cited by Warren demonstrates is the congressional rejection of language that would have created a short series of terms with a common implication of an addition.<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Warren\xe2\x80\x99s theory, moreover, has the unintended consequence of underscoring that Congress probably distinguished the terms \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d deliberately, in order to use them in separate places and to separate ends.  Warren hypothesizes that Congress attempted to tinker with the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d because it wanted to subject thermal discharges to the requirements of \xc2\xa7401, but not \xc2\xa7402.  But this assumption about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s motives only confirms the point that when Congress fine-tunes its statutory definitions, it tends to do so with a purpose in mind.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71371(c)(2).  This section addresses the intersection of the Act with another statute, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74321 <em>et seq.</em>  NEPA \xe2\x80\x9cimposes only procedural requirements on federal agencies with a particular focus on requiring agencies to undertake analyses of the environmental impact of their proposals and actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/752/index.html">541 U. S. 752</a>, 756\xe2\x80\x93757 (2004).  Section 511(c)(2) makes the point that nothing in NEPA authorizes any federal agency \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized to license or permit the conduct of any activity which may result in the discharge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d to review \xe2\x80\x9cany effluent limitation or other requirement established pursuant to this chapter or the adequacy of any certification under [\xc2\xa7401] of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71371(c)(2).

Whether a \xc2\xa7401 certification involves an activity that discharges pollutants or one that simply discharges, FERC (as an agency that may be described, always, as one with \xe2\x80\x9cauthor[ity] to license or permit the conduct of any activity which may result in the discharge of a pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>) may not review it.  Thus, nothing in \xc2\xa7511(c)(2) is disturbed by our holding that hydroelectric dams require \xc2\xa7401 state certifications.  It is still the case that, when a State has issued a certification covering a discharge that adds no pollutant, no federal agency will be deemed to have authority under NEPA to \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d any limitations or the adequacy of the \xc2\xa7401 certification.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
