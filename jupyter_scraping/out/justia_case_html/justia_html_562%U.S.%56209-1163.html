This case concerns Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure material \xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa7552(b)(2).  This provision replaced an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) exemption for \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002 (1964 ed.).  Congress believed that the \xe2\x80\x9csweep\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinternal management\xe2\x80\x9d had led to excessive withholding, and drafted Exemption 2 \xe2\x80\x9cto have a narrower reach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of Air Force</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/352/index.html">425 U.

The exemption, the Court suggested, primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources.  But the Court stated a possible caveat: That understanding of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage governed \xe2\x80\x9cat least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 369.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit subsequently converted this caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s scope, finding that the exemption also covered any \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly internal\xe2\x80\x9d materials whose disclosure would \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulation or statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crooker</em> v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms</em>, 670 F.\xc2\xa02d 1051, 1056\xe2\x80\x931057, 1074.  Courts now use the term \xe2\x80\x9cLow 2\xe2\x80\x9d for human resources and employee relations records and \xe2\x80\x9cHigh 2\xe2\x80\x9d for records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Milner submitted FOIA requests for explosives data and maps used by respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Government) in storing munitions at a naval base in Washington State.  Stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community, the Navy invoked Exemption 2 and refused to release the data.  The District Court granted the Navy summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2 interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because Exemption 2 encompasses only records relating to employee relations and human resources issues, the explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Exemption 2 shields only those records relating to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  When used as an adjective in this manner, the key statutory word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d refers to human resources matters.  For example, a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel department\xe2\x80\x9d deals with employee problems and interviews applicants for jobs.  FOIA Exemption 6 provides another example, protecting certain \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel \xe2\x80\xa6 files\xe2\x80\x9d from disclosure.  \xc2\xa7552(b)(6).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he common and congressional meaning of \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98personnel file\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is a file maintained by a human resources office collecting personal information about employees, such as examination results and work performance evaluations.  <em>Rose, supra,</em> at 377.  Exemption 2 uses \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d in the exact same way.  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices\xe2\x80\x9d all share a critical feature: They concern conditions of employment in federal agencies\xe2\x80\x94such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.  These items currently fall within the so-called Low 2 exemption.  And under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statutory language, Low 2 is all of 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose reinforces this reading.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s goal is \xe2\x80\x9cbroad disclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d and the exemptions must be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven a narrow compass.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of Justice</em> v. <em>Tax Analysts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/136/index.html">492 U. S. 136</a>, 151.  A narrow construction stands on especially firm footing with respect to Exemption 2, which was intended to hem in the expansive withholding that occurred under the prior APA exemption for \xe2\x80\x9cinternal management\xe2\x80\x9d records.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exemption 2, as interpreted here, does not reach the requested explosives information.  The data and maps, which calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations, in no way relate to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is most naturally understood.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s two alternative readings of Exemption 2 cannot be squared with the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0While the Navy has a strong security interest in shielding the explosives data and maps from public disclosure, the Government has other tools at hand to protect such information: FOIA Exemption 1 prevents access to classified documents; Exemption 3 applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure; and Exemption 7 protects \xe2\x80\x9cinformation compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d if its release, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(F).  The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the explosives information is exempt under Exemption 7 remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.  And if these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would threaten the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s vital interests, the Government may of course seek relief from Congress.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552, requires federal agencies to make Government records available to the public, subject to nine exemptions for specific categories of material.  This case concerns the scope of Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure material that is \xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(2).  Respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Government) invoked Exemption 2 to deny a FOIA request for data and maps used to help store explosives at a naval base in Washington State.  We hold that Exemption 2 does not stretch so far.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted FOIA to overhaul the public-disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002 (1964 ed.).  That section of the APA \xe2\x80\x9cwas plagued with vague phrases\xe2\x80\x9d and gradually became more \xe2\x80\x9ca withholding statute than a disclosure statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>EPA</em> v. <em>Mink</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/73/index.html">410 U. S. 73</a>, 79 (1973).  Congress intended FOIA to \xe2\x80\x9cpermit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 80.  FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose records on request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.  These exemptions are \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly made exclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 79, and must<font b="1"> be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly construed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>FBI</em> v. <em>Abramson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/615/index.html">456 U. S. 615</a>, 630 (1982). </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At issue here is Exemption 2, which shields from compelled disclosure documents \xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(2).  Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA\xe2\x80\x99s exemption for \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002 (1964 ed.).  Believing that the \xe2\x80\x9csweep\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinternal management\xe2\x80\x9d had led to excessive withholding, Congress drafted Exemption 2 \xe2\x80\x9cto have a narrower reach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of Air Force</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/352/index.html">425 U. S. 352</a>, 362\xe2\x80\x93363 (1976). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We considered the extent of that reach in <em>Department of Air Force</em> v. <em>Rose</em>.  There, we rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of Exemption 2 to withhold case summaries of honor and ethics hearings at the United States Air Force Academy.  The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources: \xe2\x80\x9cuse of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 363 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1965) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.)); see <em>Rose, </em>425 U. S.<em>, </em>at 367.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he general thrust\xe2\x80\x9d of Exemption 2, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining [such information] for public inspection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 369.  We concluded that the case summaries did not fall within the exemption because they \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not concern only routine matters\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmerely internal significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at<em> </em>370.  But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation of Exemption 2: That understanding of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage governed, we wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cat least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 369.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Crooker</em> v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms</em>, 670 F.\xc2\xa02d 1051 (1981), the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit converted this caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  <em>Crooker</em> approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a manual designed to train Government agents in law enforcement surveillance techniques.  The D. C. Circuit noted that it previously had understood Exemption 2 to \xe2\x80\x9crefe[r] only to \xe2\x80\x98pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1056 (quoting <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Department of Justice</em>, 591 F.\xc2\xa02d 753, 763 (1978)).  But the court now thought Exemption 2 should also cover any \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly internal\xe2\x80\x9d materials,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] <em>Crooker</em>, 670 F.\xc2\xa02d, <em> </em>at 1056\xe2\x80\x931057, whose disclosure would \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulations or statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 1074.  This construction of Exemption 2, the court reasoned, flowed from FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coverall design,\xe2\x80\x9d its legislative history, \xe2\x80\x9cand even common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d because Congress could not have meant to \xe2\x80\x9cenac[t] a statute whose provisions undermined \xe2\x80\xa6 the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Exemption 2.  See 575 F.\xc2\xa03d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below);<em> Massey</em> v. <em>FBI</em>, 3 F.\xc2\xa03d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); <em>Kaganove</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 856 F.\xc2\xa02d 884, 889 (CA7 1988).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And that interpretation spawned a new terminology: Courts applying the <em>Crooker </em>approach now refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cLow 2\xe2\x80\x9d exemption when discussing materials concerning human resources and employee relations, and to the \xe2\x80\x9cHigh 2\xe2\x80\x9d exemption when assessing records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.  See, <em>e.g., </em>575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 963;<em> Schiller </em>v. <em>NLRB</em>, 964 F.\xc2\xa02d 1205, 1208 (CADC 1992).<em> </em>Congress, as well, took notice of the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, borrowing language from <em>Crooker </em>to amend Exemption 7(E) when next enacting revisions to FOIA.  The amended version of Exemption 7(E) shields certain \xe2\x80\x9crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d if their disclosure \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(E); see Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, \xc2\xa71802(a), 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FOIA request at issue here arises from the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s operations at Naval Magazine Indian Island, a base in Puget Sound, Washington.  The Navy keeps weapons, ammunition, and explosives on the island.  To aid in the storage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses data known as Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information.  575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 962.  ESQD information prescribes \xe2\x80\x9cminimum separation distances\xe2\x80\x9d for explosives and helps the Navy design and construct storage facilities to prevent chain reactions in case of detonation.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The ESQD calculations are often incorporated into specialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical explosions.  See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 52.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen Milner, a Puget Sound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD information relating to Indian Island.  575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 962.  The Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community.  In support of its decision to withhold the records, the Navy invoked Exemption 2.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment to the Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2 interpretation developed in <em>Crooker</em>.  575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 963.  The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD information \xe2\x80\x9cis predominantly used for the internal purpose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 968.  And disclosure of the material, the court determined, \xe2\x80\x9cwould risk circumvention of the law\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cpoint[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreaking havoc\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 971.  The ESQD information, the court concluded, therefore qualified for a High 2 exemption.  575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split respecting Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, 561 U.

See, <em>e.g., Park \xe2\x80\x99N Fly, Inc.</em> v. <em>Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/189/index.html">469 U.

Judicial decisions since FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment have analyzed and reanalyzed the meaning of the exemption.  But comparatively little attention has focused on the provision\xe2\x80\x99s 12 simple words: \xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The key word in that dozen\xe2\x80\x94the one that most clearly marks the provision\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  When used as an adjective, as it is here to modify \xe2\x80\x9crules and practices,\xe2\x80\x9d that term refers to human resources matters.  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d in this common parlance, means \xe2\x80\x9cthe selection, placement, and training of employees and \xe2\x80\xa6 the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s).  So, for example, a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel department\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe department of a business firm that deals with problems affecting the employees of the firm and that usually interviews applicants for jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Random House Dictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House).  \xe2\x80\x9cPersonnel management\xe2\x80\x9d is similarly \xe2\x80\x9cthe phase of management concerned with the engagement and effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of human resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 1687.  And a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel agency\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9can agency for placing employable persons in jobs; employment agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Random House 1075.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemption 6.<font b="1">  See <em>Ratzlaf</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/135/index.html">510 U.

An agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices\xe2\x80\x9d are its rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources.  The D.\xc2\xa0C.

That \xe2\x80\x9cetc.\xe2\x80\x9d is important; we doubt any court could know enough about the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s operations to formulate a comprehensive list.  But all the rules and practices referenced in Exemption 2 share a critical feature: They concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies\xe2\x80\x94such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Courts in practice have had little difficulty identifying the records that qualify for withholding under this reading: They are what now commonly fall within the Low 2 exemption.  Our construction of the statutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of 2 (and that High 2 is not 2 at all, see <em>infra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9314). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose reinforces this understanding of the exemption.  We have often noted \xe2\x80\x9cthe Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of broad disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d and insisted that the exemptions be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven a narrow compass.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Department of Justice</em> v. <em>Tax Analysts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/136/index.html">492 U.

As described earlier, Congress worded that provision to hem in the prior APA exemption for \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,\xe2\x80\x9d which agencies had used to prevent access to masses of documents.  See <em>Rose</em>, 425 U. S., at 362.  We would ill-serve Congress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose by construing Exemption 2 to reauthorize the expansive withholding that Congress wanted to halt.  Our reading instead gives the exemption the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower reach\xe2\x80\x9d Congress intended, <em>id.,</em> at 363, through the simple device of confining the provision\xe2\x80\x99s meaning to its<font b="1"> words.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government resists giving \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d its plain meaning on the ground that Congress, when drafting Exemption 2, considered but chose not to enact language exempting \xe2\x80\x9cinternal employment rules and practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 30\xe2\x80\x9334, and n. 11.  This drafting history, the Navy maintains, proves that Congress did not wish \xe2\x80\x9cto limit the Exemption to employment-related matters,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 31, even if the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d conveys that meaning in other contexts, <em>id., </em>at 41.  But we think the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s evidence insufficient: The scant history concerning this word change as easily supports the inference that Congress merely swapped one synonym for another.  Cf. <em>Mead Corp.</em> v. <em>Tilley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/714/index.html">490 U.

Those of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text.  We will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exemption 2, as we have construed it, does not reach the ESQD information at issue here.  These data and maps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations.  By no stretch of imagination do they relate to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is most naturally understood.  They concern the physical rules governing explosives, not the workplace rules governing sailors; they address the handling of dangerous materials, not the treatment of employees.  The Navy therefore may not use Exemption 2, interpreted in accord with its plain meaning to cover human resources matters, to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government offers two alternative readings of Exemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD information.  We cannot square either with the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction of Exemption 2 pioneered by <em>Crooker</em>, which shields material not only if it meets the criteria set out above (Low 2), but also if it is \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant[ly] interna[l]\xe2\x80\x9d and its \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal agency functions\xe2\x80\x9d (High 2).  Brief for Respondent 41 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The dissent, too, favors this reading of the statute.  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  But the <em>Crooker </em>interpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent flaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The High 2 test (in addition to substituting the word \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9csolely,\xe2\x80\x9d see n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>) ignores the plain meaning of the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939, and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or referent in Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s language.  Indeed, the only way to arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccutting out some\xe2\x80\x9d words and \xe2\x80\x9cpasting in others\xe2\x80\x9d until little of the actual provision remains.  <em>Elliott</em> v. <em>Department of Agriculture</em>, 596 F.\xc2\xa03d 842, 845 (CADC 2010).  Because this is so, High 2 is better labeled \xe2\x80\x9cNon 2\xe2\x80\x9d (and Low 2 \xe2\x80\xa6 just 2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its text-light approach to the statute, the Government relies primarily on legislative history, placing particular emphasis on the House Report concerning FOIA.  See Brief for Respondent 33\xe2\x80\x9338.  A statement in that Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the exemption and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2 construction.  According to the Report: \xe2\x80\x9cOperating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption would not cover \xe2\x80\xa6 employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966).  But the Senate Report says exactly the opposite, explaining in support of a Low 2 interpretation that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9crules as to personnel\xe2\x80\x99s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at\xc2\xa08.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In <em>Rose</em>, we gave reasons for thinking the Senate Report the more reliable of the two.  See 425 U. S., at 366.  But the more fundamental point is what we said before: Legislative history, for those who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 9; <em>Wong Yang Sung</em> v. <em>McGrath</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/33/index.html">339 U. S. 33</a>, 49 (1950) (declining to consult legislative history when that \xe2\x80\x9chistory is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d).  When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory language and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must choose the language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also advances, in support of <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s High 2 approach, an argument based on subsequent legislative action.  Congress, the Government notes, amended Exemption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records whose production \xe2\x80\x9cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reason-ably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(E).  That amendment, the Government contends, codified <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvention of the law\xe2\x80\x9d standard and, in so doing, ratified <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Brief for Respondent 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  The dissent likewise counts as significant that Congress \xe2\x80\x9ct[ook] note\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Crooker </em>in revising FOIA.  <em>Post</em>, at 9; see <em>post</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Government and the dissent neglect the key feature of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not Exemption 2 (the subject of <em>Crooker</em>), but instead Exemption 7(E).  And the <em>Crooker</em> construction of Exemption 2 renders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect.  See, <em>e.g., TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/19/index.html">534 U. S. 19</a>, 31 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We cannot think of any document eligible for withholding under Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not capture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the law enforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly internal.\xe2\x80\x9d  So if Congress had agreed with <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no reason to alter Exemption 7(E).  In that event, Congress would either have left the statute alone (on the theory that <em>Crooker </em>would do the necessary work) or would have amended Exemption 2 specifically to ratify <em>Crooker</em>.  The decision instead to amend Exemption 7(E) suggests that Congress approved the circumvention standard only as to law enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of records High 2 covers.  Perhaps this legislative action does not show that Congress affirmatively disagreed with <em>Crooker; </em>maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the circumvention standard should apply to other records.  But one thing is clear: The 1986 amendment does not ratify, approve, or otherwise signal agreement with <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Exemption 2.  This argument therefore cannot save the High 2 construction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2, and indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.  <em>Crooker</em>, the dissent asserts, \xe2\x80\x9chas been consistently relied upon and followed for 30 years\xe2\x80\x9d by other lower courts.  <em>Post</em>, at 9; see <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  But this claim, too, trips at the starting gate.  It would be immaterial even if true, because we have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other courts have done so.  And in any event, it is not true.  Prior to <em>Crooker</em>, three Circuits adopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and they have not changed their minds.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Since <em>Crooker</em>, three other Circuits have accepted the High 2 reading.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  One Circuit has reserved judgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate.  See <em>Audubon Society</em> v. <em>Forest Serv.</em>, 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201, 1203\xe2\x80\x931204 (CA10 1997).  And the rest have not considered the matter.  (No one should think <em>Crooker </em>has been extensively discussed or debated in the Courts of Appeals.  In the past three decades, <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of Exemption 2<em> </em>has been cited a sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions outside the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x94on average, once every six years.)  The result is a 4 to 3 split among the Circuits.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation to take the side of the bare majority.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Presumably because <em>Crooker </em>so departs from Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x99s language, the Government also offers another construction, which it says we might adopt \xe2\x80\x9con a clean slate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the plain text \xe2\x80\xa6 alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15.  On this reading, the exemption \xe2\x80\x9cencompasses records concerning an agency\xe2\x80\x99s internal rules and practices for its personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental functions.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id., </em>at 20; see also <em>id.</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (Exemption 2 \xe2\x80\x9capplies generally to matters concerning internal rules and practices to guide agency personnel in performing their duties\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to the Government, this interpretation makes sense because \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98personnel rules and practices of an agency\xe2\x80\x99 is logically understood to mean an agency\xe2\x80\x99s rules and practices <em>for its personnel</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the purported logic in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s definition eludes us.  We would not say, in ordinary parlance, that a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel file\xe2\x80\x9d is any file an employee uses, or that a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel department\xe2\x80\x9d is any department in which an employee serves.  No more would we say that a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rule or practice\xe2\x80\x9d is any rule or practice that assists an employee in doing her job.  The use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d in each of these phrases connotes not that the file or department or practice/rule is <em>for</em> personnel, but rather that the file or department or practice/rule is <em>about</em> personnel\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that it relates to employee relations or human resources.  This case well illustrates the point.  The records requested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps showing the distances that potential blasts travel.  This information no doubt assists Navy personnel in storing munitions.  But that is not to say that the data and maps relate to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  No one staring at these charts of explosions and using ordinary language would describe them in this manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclean slate\xe2\x80\x9d construction reaches such documents only by stripping the word \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d of any real meaning.  Under this interpretation, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinternal personnel rules and practices\xe2\x80\x9d appears to mean all its internal rules and practices.  That is because agencies necessarily operate through personnel, and so all their internal rules and practices are for personnel.  The modifier \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d then, does no modifying work; it does not limit the class of internal rules and practices that Exemption 2 covers.  What is most naturally viewed as the provision\xe2\x80\x99s key word\xe2\x80\x94the term that ought to define its scope\xe2\x80\x94does nothing more than state the truism that in an agency it is \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d who follow internal rules and practices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemption, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a disclosure than \xe2\x80\x9ca withholding statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mink</em>, 410 U. S., at 79.  Many documents an agency generates in some way aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities.  If Exemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the limitations Congress placed on their application.  Exemption 7, for example, shields records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria is met.  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7).  Yet on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, an agency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemption 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel in performing their duties.  Indeed, an agency could use Exemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to withhold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s more targeted exemptions.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2\xe2\x80\x94call it \xe2\x80\x9cSuper 2\xe2\x80\x9d now\xe2\x80\x94would extend, rather than narrow, the APA\xe2\x80\x99s former exemption for records relating to the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal management of an agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002 (1964 ed.).  We doubt that even the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal management\xe2\x80\x9d provision, which Congress thought allowed too much withholding, see <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 2, would have protected all information that guides employees in the discharge of their duties, including the explosives data and maps in this case.  And perhaps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates the rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions.  See, <em>e.g., Abramson</em>, 456 U. S., at 630; <em>Rose</em>, 425 U. S., at 361.  Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or purpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Government proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other similar information.  The Government has informed us that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would significantly risk undermining the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to safely and securely store military ordnance,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representation.  The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclosure of this information could be used to \xe2\x80\x9cwrea[k] havoc\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake catastrophe more likely.\xe2\x80\x9d  575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971.  Concerns of this kind\xe2\x80\x94a sense that certain sensitive information <em>should</em> be exempt from disclosure\xe2\x80\x94in part led the <em>Crooker </em>court to formulate the<em> </em>High 2 standard.  See 670 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1074 (contending that \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d supported the High 2 interpretation because Congress would not have wanted FOIA to \xe2\x80\x9cundermin[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we acknowledge that our decision today upsets three decades of agency practice relying on <em>Crooker</em>, and therefore may force considerable adjustments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also note, however, that the Government has other tools at hand to shield national security information and other sensitive materials.  Most notably, Exemption 1 of FOIA prevents access to classified documents.  \xc2\xa7552(b)(1); see 575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemption 1 is \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically designed to allow government agencies to withhold information that might jeopardize our national security\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government generally may classify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see Exec. Order No. 13526, \xc2\xa71.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009); an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide whether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of classification.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  Exemption 3 also may mitigate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s security concerns.  That provision applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure, \xc2\xa7552(b)(3), thus offering Congress an established, streamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records that FOIA would not otherwise protect.  And Exemption 7, as already noted, protects \xe2\x80\x9cinformation compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d that meets one of six criteria, including if its release \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(F).  The Navy argued below that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemption 7(F), see n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>, and that claim remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would threaten the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s vital interests, the Government may of course seek relief from Congress.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.  All we hold today is that Congress has not enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.  We leave to Congress, as is appropriate, the question whether it should do so.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exemption 2, consistent with the plain meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel rules and practices,\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses only records relating to issues of employee relations and human resources.

But nothing in FOIA either explicitly or implicitly grants courts discretion to expand (or contract) an exemption on this basis.  In enacting FOIA, Congress struck the balance it thought right\xe2\x80\x94generally favoring disclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions\xe2\x80\x94and did so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government.

In <em>Abraham &amp; Rose, P.L.C.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, cited by the dissent, the Sixth Circuit rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Exemption 2 shielded records of federal tax lien filings.  138 F.\xc2\xa03d 1075, 1082 (1998).  The court nowhere discussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here.  Its only reference to <em>Crooker</em> concerned the part of that decision interpreting \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 138 F.3d<em>, </em>at 1080; see also n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in <em>Rugiero</em> v. <em>Department of Justice</em>, that Exemption 2 applies to \xe2\x80\x9croutine matters of merely internal significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  257 F.\xc2\xa03d 534, 549 (2001).  In <em>Sladek</em> v. <em>Bensinger</em>, which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent\xe2\x80\x99s manual because it \xe2\x80\x9cis not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of parking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2.\xe2\x80\x9d  605 F.\xc2\xa02d 899, 902 (1979).  In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court acknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.  The court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation because it would not have changed the case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.  See <em>ibid.  </em>Finally, the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the dissent does not say otherwise.  The exemption, according to that most recent Eighth Circuit decision, applies \xe2\x80\x9conly [to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s] housekeeping matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cox</em>, 576 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1309\xe2\x80\x931310 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The dissent is surely right to say, <em>post</em> at 2, that <em>Crooker</em> \xe2\x80\x9chas guided nearly every FOIA case decided over the last 30 years\xe2\x80\x9d in Circuits applying <em>Crooker</em>; but that statement does not hold in the Circuits using the Low 2 approach.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Notably, even those courts approving <em>Crooker</em> have disagreed about how to apply High 2.  Fault lines include whether the risk of circumvention must be significant, see, <em>e.g., Hidalgo</em> v. <em>FBI</em>, 541 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15\xe2\x80\x9316; whether courts should consider the public interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see, <em>e.g., </em>Department of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act, p.\xc2\xa0185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person or entity threatening circumvention; compare, <em>e.g., </em>575 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971, with, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 978 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting).  The disagreement is not surprising.  Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts lack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage. </p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent asserts that \xe2\x80\x9c30 years of experience\xe2\x80\x9d with a more expansive interpretation of the exemption suggests no \xe2\x80\x9cseriou[s] interfere[nce] with \xe2\x80\xa6 FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s informational objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  But those objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based on an improper interpretation of the statute.  To give just one example, the U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple occasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting sites.  See <em>Audubon Society</em> v. <em>Forest Serv.</em>, 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997)<em>; Maricopa Audubon Soc.</em> v. <em>Forest Serv.</em>, 108 F.\xc2\xa03d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997).  And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies may too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure.  According to <em>amicus</em> Public Citizen, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile reliance on exemptions overall rose 83% from 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose 344% during that same time period.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Public Citizen et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 24.  In 2009 alone, federal departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000 times to prevent access to records.  See Brief for Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.  We do not doubt that many of these FOIA denials were appropriate.  But we are unable to accept the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s unsupported declaration that a sweeping construction of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s goal of broad disclosure. </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963409">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nMILNER V.

As the Court explains, however, the Government may avail itself of numerous other exemptions, see <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x94exemptions that may have been overshadowed in recent years by the broad reach of High 2.  I write separately to underscore the alternative argument that the Navy raised below, which rested on Exemption 7(F) and which will remain open on remand. See\n<em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa03, 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Exemption 7 applies to specific categories of information \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(7).  In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits withholding of \xe2\x80\x9crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d that, if disclosed, \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(F).  In most cases involving security information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure may \xe2\x80\x9cendanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  A more difficult question, however, is whether the information is \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>John Doe Agency</em> v. <em>John Doe Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/146/index.html">493 U. S. 146</a>, 153 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cBefore it may invoke [Exemption 7], the Government has the burden of proving the existence of \xe2\x80\xa6 a compilation for such a purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  In my view, this phrase reasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official security and crime prevention duties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>\xe2\x80\x9cLaw enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  The ordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the investigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been committed, but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal activity and to maintain security.  A \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as one \xe2\x80\x9cwhose duty it is to preserve the peace,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and fulfilling that duty involves a range of activities.  Police on the beat aim to prevent crime from occurring, and they no less carry out \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d than officers investigating a crime scene.  Similarly, a \xe2\x80\x9claw-enforcement agency\xe2\x80\x9d is charged with \xe2\x80\x9cthe apprehension of alleged offenders <em>as well as crime detection and prevention</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. De Sola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Crime prevention and security measures are critical to effective law enforcement as we know it.  There can be no doubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a\nlaw enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials from attack, even though no investigation may be ongoing.  Likewise, steps by law enforcement officers to prevent terrorism surely fulfill \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Particularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and national security measures have been recognized as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in our Nation.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,\xe2\x80\x9d the priorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \xe2\x80\x9cshifted dramatically,\xe2\x80\x9d and the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctop priority became the prevention of another terrorist attack.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Science, the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 10, 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III).  Today, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he FBI\xe2\x80\x99s number one priority continues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearings before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, 111th Cong., 2d Sess, p.\xc2\xa0___ (Sept. 22, 2010) (testimony of Mueller).  If crime prevention and security measures do not serve \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d then those charged with law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of fulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read naturally, \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d involve more than just investigation and prosecution.  As Exemption 7\xe2\x80\x99s subparagraphs demonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these narrower activities.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(A) (information that \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7552(b)(7)(E) (information that \xe2\x80\x9cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to use different language to trigger Exemption 7 confirms that the concept of \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d sweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution.  See <em>Sosa</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Machain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/692/index.html">542 U. S. 692</a>, 711, n. 9 (2004) (applying the \xe2\x80\x9cusual rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0when the legis-\nlature uses certain language in one part of the statute\nand different language in another, the court assumes dif-\nferent meanings were intended\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>\xe2\x80\x9cCompiled for law enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  This Court has given a fairly broad meaning to \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7552(b)(7).  In <em>John Doe Agency</em>, we held that information need not have been originally \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d to satisfy Exemption 7\xe2\x80\x99s threshold requirement.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0documents were put together at an earlier time for a different purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d they may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled for law enforcement purposes.  493 U. S., at 154\xe2\x80\x93155.  For example, documents originally gathered for routine business purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later compiled for use in a criminal investigation.  Similarly, federal building plans and related information\xe2\x80\x94which may have been compiled originally for architectural planning or internal purposes\xe2\x80\x94may fall within Exemption 7 if that information is later compiled and given to law enforcement officers for security purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not nec-\nessarily deprived of Exemption 7\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  The text\nof Exemption 7 does not require that the information\nbe compiled <em>solely </em>for law enforcement purposes. Cf<em>. </em>\xc2\xa7552(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, it may be enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant reason for the compilation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information falls within Exemption 7(F).  The ESQD information, the Navy argues, is used \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of identifying and addressing security issues\xe2\x80\x9d and for the \xe2\x80\x9cprotection of people and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby community, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that could occur from an accident or breach of security.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellee in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9336056 (CA9), pp.\xc2\xa039\xe2\x80\x9340.  If, indeed, the ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to prevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security, there is a reasonable argument that the information has been \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552(b)(7).  Assuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the ESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption 7(F). </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963410">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nMILNER V.

I recognize that there is reasonable ground for disagreement over the precise status of certain pre-<em>Crooker</em> precedents, but the <em>Crooker</em> interpretation of Exemption 2 has guided nearly every Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case decided over the last 30 years.  See generally Dept. of Justice, Guide to Freedom of Information Act, pp. 184\xe2\x80\x93206 (2009) (FOIA Guide) (identifying over 100 district court decisions applying the <em>Crooker</em> approach, and one appearing to reject it).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, moreover, well aware of <em>Crooker,</em> left Exemption 2, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(2), untouched when it amended the FOIA five years later.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93221, p. 25 (1983) (discussing <em>Crooker</em>); Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x9348 (amending Exemption 7, 5 U.

Eskridge, P. Frickey, &amp; E. Garrett, Cases and Materials on Legislation 1048 (4th ed. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he acquiescence rule can also support implicit congressional ratification of a uniform line of federal appellate interpretations \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, even if the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis would have persuaded me if written on a blank slate, <em>Crooker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was careful and its holding reasonable.  The Circuit Court examined the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, the legislative history, and the precedent.  It recognized that the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s words (\xe2\x80\x9crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\xe2\x80\x9d) could easily be read, as the Court reads them today, to refer only to human resources rules and practices.  See 670 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1056\xe2\x80\x931057.  But it also thought that those words could be read more broadly as referring to internal rules or practices that set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to follow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the information at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cnot of legitimate public interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Id.</em>, at 1056, 1057.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit agreed with today\xe2\x80\x99s Court that the Senate Report described the exemption as referring to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98internal personnel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d matters, giving as examples \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98personnel\xe2\x80\x99s use of parking facilities, \xe2\x80\xa6 sick leave, and the like.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 1058\xe2\x80\x931059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8 (1965)).  But it also noted that the House Report described the exemption as protecting from disclosure \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]perating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  670 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)).  \xe2\x80\x9c[U]pon reflection,\xe2\x80\x9d it thought the views of the two Houses \xe2\x80\x9creconcilable\xe2\x80\x9d if one understood <em>both </em>sets of examples as referring to internal staff information (both minor personnel matters and staff instruction matters) that the public had no legitimate interest in learning about.  670 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1065.  And it accepted this view in light of its hesitation to \xe2\x80\x9capply individual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforcement efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1066.  At the same time it found no other exemption that would protect internal documents in which there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure\xe2\x80\x94a category that includes, say, building plans, safe combinations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the like.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After examining in depth the legislative history and relevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based on a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as language used by this Court in <em>Department of Air Force</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/352/index.html">425 U. S. 352</a>, 369 (1976).  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held that a document fits within the literal language of Exemption 2 and is exempt from disclosure <em>if </em>(1) it \xe2\x80\x9cmeets the test of \xe2\x80\x98predominant internality,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the document is \xe2\x80\x9cnot of legitimate public interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>and </em>(2) \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crooker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1056, 1074; see also <em>Rose</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 369 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply where \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  This test, based upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99 broader FOIA objectives and a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d view of what information Congress did and did not want to make available, <em>Crooker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1074, takes the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical approach\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently \xe2\x80\xa6 taken\xe2\x80\x9d when interpreting the FOIA, <em>John Doe Agency</em> v. <em>John Doe Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/146/index.html">493 U. S. 146</a>, 157 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would not underestimate the importance of this \xe2\x80\x9cpractical approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  It reflects this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding recognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part) with the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the tax code.  See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \xc2\xa77.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudicial interpretation of the malleable language of the APA has produced changes in the rulemaking procedure that could be characterized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day or a year rather than gradually over a period of decades\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. Sunstein &amp; Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions, 101 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 885, 917\xe2\x80\x93918, and n.\xc2\xa0111 (2003) (observing that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cappears to rely on courts for long periods of time\xe2\x80\x9d to give meaning to the APA, which justifies interpreting it less formalistically than statutes like \xe2\x80\x9cthe Internal Revenue Code\xe2\x80\x9d).  That in large part is because the FOIA (like the APA but unlike the tax code) must govern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numerous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, performing numerous tasks of many different kinds.  Too narrow an interpretation, while working well in the case of one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional objectives when applied to another.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemption 2 in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic effort to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9cworkable balance between the interests of the public in greater access to information and the needs of the Government to protect certain kinds of information from disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> John Doe Agency</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 157.  See also S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 8, 11 (1964) (emphasizing this \xe2\x80\x9cworkable\xe2\x80\x9d balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5 (same); H. R. Rep. No. 1497, at 2, 6 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, 30 years of experience with <em>Crooker\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding suggests that it has not seriously interfered with the FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s informational objectives, while at the same time it has permitted agencies to withhold much information which, in my view, Congress would not have wanted to force into the public realm.  To focus only on the case law, courts have held that that information protected by Exemption 2 includes blueprints for Department of Agriculture buildings that store biological agents, <em>Elliot</em> v. <em>Department of Agriculture</em>, 518 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 217 (DC 2007); documents that would help hackers access National Aeronautics and Space Administration computers, <em>Knight</em> v. <em>NASA</em>, No.\xc2\xa02:04\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x932054\xe2\x80\x93MCE\xe2\x80\x93GGH, 2006 WL 3780901, *6 (ED Cal., Dec. 21, 2006); agency credit card numbers, <em>Judicial Watch, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 83 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 105, 110 (DC 1999); Commodity Futures Trading Commission guidelines for settling cases, <em>Shu-maker, Loop &amp; Kendrick, LLP</em> v. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, No.\xc2\xa03:97 CV 7139, 1997 U.

Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa09 (citing <em>Audubon Society</em> v. <em>Forest Serv.</em>, 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997), and<em> Maricopa Audubon Soc.</em> v. <em>Forest Serv.</em>, 108 F.\xc2\xa03d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997)).  See generally FOIA Guide 201, and n.\xc2\xa0106 (citing nine decisions applying the <em>Crooker</em> approach but nonetheless requiring disclosure).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cour decision today upsets three decades of agency practice relying on <em>Crooker</em>, and therefore may force considerable adjustments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  But how are these adjustments to be made?  Should the Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the protection it believes necessary?  As Justice Alito notes, Exemption 7 applies where the documents consist of \xe2\x80\x9crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\xe2\x80\x9d and release would, <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cdisclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(7).  But what about information that is <em>not </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes, such as building plans, computer passwords, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations?  The Government, which has much experience litigating FOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 \xe2\x80\x9ctargets only a subset of the important agency functions that may be circumvented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision only confirms this point, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid reading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide <em>Crooker</em>-type protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that the Government can classify  documents that should remain private.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material \xe2\x80\x9cproperly classified\xe2\x80\x9d as authorized to be \xe2\x80\x9ckept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\xe2\x80\x9d).  But classification is at best a partial solution.  It takes time.  It is subject to its own rules.  As the Government points out, it would hinder the sharing of information about Government buildings with \xe2\x80\x9cfirst responders,\xe2\x80\x9d such as local fire and police departments.  Brief for Respondent 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  And both Congress and the President believe the Nation currently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified material.  See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat. 2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3 CFR 298, 299\xe2\x80\x93300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.).  Indeed, Congress recently found:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe 9/11 Commission and others have observed that  the over-classification of information interferes with accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the cost of information security, and needlessly limits stakeholder and public access to information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOver-classification of information causes considerable confusion regarding what information may be shared with whom, and negatively affects the dissemination of information within the Federal Government and with State, local, and tribal entities, and with the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reducing Over-Classification Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese legislative findings suggest that it is \xe2\x80\x9cover-classification,\xe2\x80\x9d not <em>Crooker, </em>that poses the more serious threat to the FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s public information objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That leaves congressional action.  As the Court points out, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it finds in today\xe2\x80\x99s narrowing of Exemption 2.  But legislative action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other matters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may warrant higher legislative priority.  In my view, it is for the courts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Congress\xe2\x80\x99 public information objectives into workable agency practice, and to adhere to such interpretations once they are settled.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why: Where the courts have already interpreted Exemption 2, where that interpretation has been consistently relied upon and followed for 30 years, where Congress has taken note of that interpretation in amending other parts of the statute, where that interpretation is reasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and achieved commonsense results, where it is consistent with the FOIA\xe2\x80\x99s overall statutory goals, where a new and different interpretation raises serious problems of its own, and where that new interpretation would require Congress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo, I\xc2\xa0would let sleeping legal dogs lie.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
