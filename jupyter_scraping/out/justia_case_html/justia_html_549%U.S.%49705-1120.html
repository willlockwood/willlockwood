EPA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">MASSACHUSETTS et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x931120.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 29, 2006\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 2, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">Based on respected scientific opinion that a well-documented rise in global temperatures and attendant climatological and environmental changes have resulted from a significant increase in the atmospheric concentration of \xe2\x80\x9cgreenhouse gases,\xe2\x80\x9d a group of private organizations petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin regulating the emissions of four such gases, including carbon dioxide, under \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, which requires that the EPA \xe2\x80\x9cshall by regulation prescribe \xe2\x80\xa6 standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class \xe2\x80\xa6 of new motor vehicles \xe2\x80\xa6 which in [the EPA Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution \xe2\x80\xa6 reasonably \xe2\x80\xa6 anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollution agent \xe2\x80\xa6 , including any physical, chemical \xe2\x80\xa6 substance \xe2\x80\xa6 emitted into \xe2\x80\xa6 the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77602(g).  EPA ultimately denied the petition, reasoning that (1) the Act does not authorize it to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change, and (2) even if it had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would have been unwise to do so at that time because a causal link between greenhouse gases and the increase in global surface air temperatures was not unequivocally established.  The agency further characterized any EPA regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a piecemeal approach to climate change that would conflict with the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive approach involving additional support for technological innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further research on climate change, and might hamper the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to persuade key developing nations to reduce emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, now joined by intervenor Massachusetts and other state and local governments, sought review in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  Although each of the three judges on the panel wrote separately, two of them agreed that the EPA Administrator properly exercised his discretion in denying the rulemaking petition.  One judge concluded that the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether a pollutant could \xe2\x80\x9creasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77521(a)(1), could be based on scientific uncertainty as well as other factors, including the concern that unilateral U. S. regulation of motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce other countries\xe2\x80\x99 greenhouse gas emissions.  The second judge opined that petitioners had failed to demonstrate the particularized injury to them that is necessary to establish standing under Article III, but accepted the contrary view as the law of the case and joined the judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred.  The court therefore denied review.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Petitioners have standing to challenge the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of their rulemaking petition.

Moreover, the proper construction of a congressional statute is an eminently suitable question for federal-court resolution, and Congress has authorized precisely this type of challenge to EPA action, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(1).  Contrary to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s argument, standing doctrine presents no insuperable jurisdictional obstacle here.  To demonstrate standing, a litigant must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that a favorable decision will likely redress that injury.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561.  However, a litigant to whom Congress has \xe2\x80\x9caccorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 573, n. 7\xe2\x80\x94here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, \xc2\xa77607(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>Only one petitioner needs to have standing to authorize review.  See <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/47/index.html">547 U. S. 47</a>, 52, n. 2.  Massachusetts has a special position and interest here.  It is a sovereign State and not, as in <em>Lujan</em>, a private individual, and it actually owns a great deal of the territory alleged to be affected.  The sovereign prerogatives to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, to negotiate emissions treaties with developing countries, and (in some circumstances) to exercise the police power to reduce motor-vehicle emissions are now lodged in the Federal Government.  Because congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing applicable standards, \xc2\xa77521(a)(1), and has given Massachusetts a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious, \xc2\xa77607(b)(1), petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the adversarial process.  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimminent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U. S., at 560, and there is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested\xe2\x80\x9d will prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk, <em>Duke Power Co.</em> v. <em>Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/59/index.html">438 U. S. 59</a>, 79.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s own objective assessment of the relevant science and a strong consensus among qualified experts indicate that global warming threatens, <em>inter alia,</em> a precipitate rise in sea levels, severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems, a significant reduction in winter snowpack with direct and important economic consequences, and increases in the spread of disease and the ferocity of weather events.  That these changes are widely shared does not minimize Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 interest in the outcome of this litigation.  See<em> Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Akins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/11/index.html">524 U. S. 11</a>, 24.  According to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 uncontested affidavits, global sea levels rose between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming and have already begun to swallow Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 coastal land.  Remediation costs alone, moreover, could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Given EPA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, its refusal to regulate such emissions, at a minimum, \xe2\x80\x9ccontributes\xe2\x80\x9d to Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 injuries.  EPA overstates its case in arguing that its decision not to regulate contributes so insignificantly to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 injuries that it cannot be haled into federal court, and that there is no realistic possibility that the relief sought would mitigate global climate change and remedy petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 injuries, especially since predicted increases in emissions from China, India, and other developing nations will likely offset any marginal domestic decrease EPA regulation could bring about.  Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell swoop, see <em>Williamson</em> v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/483/index.html">348 U. S. 483</a>, 489, but instead whittle away over time, refining their approach as circumstances change and they develop a more nuanced understanding of how best to proceed, cf. <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/194/index.html">332 U. S. 194</a>, 202\xe2\x80\x93203.  That a first step might be tentative does not by itself negate federal-court jurisdiction.  And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly tentative.  Leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the record indicates that the U. S. transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0While regulating motor-vehicle emissions may not by itself <em>reverse</em> global warming, it does not follow that the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to <em>slow</em> or <em>reduce</em> it.  See <em>Larson</em> v. <em>Valente</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/228/index.html">456 U. S. 228</a>, 243, n.\xc2\xa015.  Because of the enormous potential consequences, the fact that a remedy\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.  Nor is it dispositive that developing countries are poised to substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.  The Court attaches considerable significance to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s espoused belief that global climate change must be addressed.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The scope of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the merits of the statutory issues is narrow.  Although an agency\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review, <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/821/index.html">470 U. S. 821</a>, there are key differences between nonenforcement and denials of rulemaking petitions that are, as in the present circumstances, expressly authorized.  EPA concluded alternatively in its petition denial that it lacked authority under \xc2\xa77521(a)(1) to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77602, and that, even if it possessed authority, it would decline to exercise it because regulation would conflict with other administration priorities.  Because the Act expressly permits review of such an action, \xc2\xa77607(b)(1), this Court \xe2\x80\x9cmay reverse [it if it finds it to be] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77607(d)(9).  Pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s capacious definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d EPA has statutory authority to regulate emission of such gases from new motor vehicles.  That definition\xe2\x80\x94which includes \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> air pollution agent \xe2\x80\xa6 , including <em>any</em> physical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance \xe2\x80\xa6 emitted into \xe2\x80\xa6 the ambient air \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77602(g) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.  Moreover, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are undoubtedly \xe2\x80\x9cphysical [and] chemical \xe2\x80\xa6 substance[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  EPA\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on postenactment congressional actions and deliberations it views as tantamount to a command to refrain from regulating greenhouse gas emissions is unavailing.  Even if postenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA identifies nothing suggesting that Congress meant to curtail EPA\xe2\x80\x99s power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants.  The Court has no difficulty reconciling Congress\xe2\x80\x99 various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and research to better understand climate change with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing mandate to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d that may endanger the public welfare.  <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 133, distinguished.  Also unpersuasive is EPA\xe2\x80\x99s argument that its regulation of motor-vehicle carbon dioxide emissions would require it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that Congress has assigned to the Department of Transportation.  The fact that DOT\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to promote energy efficiency by setting mileage standards may overlap with EPA\xe2\x80\x99s environmental responsibilities in no way licenses EPA to shirk its duty to protect the public \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77521(a)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9330. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s alternative basis for its decision\xe2\x80\x94that even if it has statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do so at this time\xe2\x80\x94rests on reasoning  divorced from the statutory text.  While the statute conditions EPA action on its formation of a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant \xe2\x80\x9ccause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77601(a)(1). Under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s clear terms, EPA can avoid promulgating regulations only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.  It has refused to do so, offering instead a laundry list of reasons not to regulate, including the existence of voluntary Executive Branch programs providing a response to global warming and impairment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to negotiate with developing nations to reduce emissions.  These policy judgments have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and do not amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment.  Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time.  If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment, it must say so.  The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists for it to make an endangerment finding.  Instead, EPA rejected the rulemaking petition based on impermissible considerations.  Its action was therefore \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77607(d)(9).  On remand,  EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute.

Specifically, petitioners asked us to answer two questions concerning the meaning of \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) of the Act: whether EPA has the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles; and if so, whether its stated reasons for refusing to do so are consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response, EPA, supported by 10 intervening States[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and six trade associations,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] correctly argued that we may not address those two questions unless at least one petitioner has standing to invoke our jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution.  Notwithstanding the serious character of that jurisdictional argument and the absence of any conflicting decisions construing \xc2\xa7202(a)(1), the unusual importance of the underlying issue persuaded us to grant the writ.  548 U.

In 1978, Congress enacted the National Climate Program Act, 92 Stat. 601, which required the President to establish a program to \xe2\x80\x9cassist the Nation and the world to understand and respond to natural and man-induced climate processes and their implications,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa73.

Congress emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9congoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ecessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71102(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, the scientific understanding of climate change progressed.  In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a multinational scientific body organized under the auspices of the United Nations, published its first comprehensive report on the topic.  Drawing on expert opinions from across the globe, the IPCC concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cemissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of \xe2\x80\xa6 greenhouse gases [which] will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to the IPCC report, the United Nations convened the \xe2\x80\x9cEarth Summit\xe2\x80\x9d in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.  The first President Bush attended and signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a nonbinding agreement among 154 nations to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ing] dangerous anthropogenic [<em>i.e.</em>, human-induced] interference with the [Earth\xe2\x80\x99s] climate system.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  S.

Because those targets did not apply to developing and heavily polluting nations such as China and India, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution expressing its sense that the United States should not enter into the Kyoto Protocol.  See S. Res. 98, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 25, 1997) (as passed).  President Clinton did not submit the protocol to the Senate for ratification.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 20, 1999, a group of 19 private organizations[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] filed a rulemaking petition asking EPA to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cgreenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under \xc2\xa7202 of the Clean Air Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 5.  Petitioners maintained that 1998 was the \xe2\x80\x9cwarmest year on record\xe2\x80\x9d; that carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are \xe2\x80\x9cheat trapping greenhouse gases\xe2\x80\x9d; that greenhouse gas emissions have significantly accelerated climate change; and that the IPCC\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 report warned that \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon dioxide remains the most important contributor to [man-made] forcing of climate change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The petition further alleged that climate change will have serious adverse effects on human health and the environment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 22\xe2\x80\x9335.  As to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory authority, the petition observed that the agency itself had already confirmed that it had the power to regulate carbon dioxide.  See <em>id.,</em> at 18, n. 21.  In 1998, Jonathan Z. Cannon, then EPA\xe2\x80\x99s General Counsel, prepared a legal opinion concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cCO<font super="-1">2 emissions are within the scope of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate,\xe2\x80\x9d even as he recognized that EPA had so far declined to exercise that authority.  <em>Id.,</em> at 54 (memorandum to Carol M. Browner, Administrator (Apr. 10, 1998) (hereinafter Cannon memorandum)).  Cannon\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Gary S.

See <em>id.,</em> at 61.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifteen months after the petition\xe2\x80\x99s submission, EPA requested public comment on \xe2\x80\x9call the issues raised in [the] petition,\xe2\x80\x9d adding a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular\xe2\x80\x9d request for comments on \xe2\x80\x9cany scientific, technical, legal, economic or other aspect of these issues that may be relevant to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of this petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 Fed. Reg. 7486, 7487 (2001).  EPA received more than 50,000 comments over the next five months.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 52924 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the close of the comment period, the White House sought \xe2\x80\x9cassistance in identifying the areas in the science of climate change where there are the greatest certainties and uncertainties\xe2\x80\x9d from the National Research Council, asking for a response \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 213.  The result was a 2001 report titled Climate Change: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (NRC Report), which, drawing heavily on the 1995 IPCC report, concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[g]reenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.  Temperatures are, in fact, rising.\xe2\x80\x9d  NRC Report 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the rulemaking petition.  68 Fed. Reg. 52922.  The agency gave two reasons for its decision: (1) that contrary to the opinions of its former general counsels, the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change, see <em>id.,</em> at 52925\xe2\x80\x9352929; and (2) that even if the agency had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would be unwise to do so at this time, <em>id.,</em> at 52929\xe2\x80\x9352931.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that it lacked statutory authority over greenhouse gases, EPA observed that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cwas well aware of the global climate change issue when it last comprehensively amended the [Clean Air Act] in 1990,\xe2\x80\x9d yet it declined to adopt a proposed amendment establishing binding emissions limitations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52926.  Congress instead chose to authorize further investigation into climate change.  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7103(g) and 602(e) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 104 Stat. 2652, 2703, 42 U.

Reg. 52926\xe2\x80\x94in particular, its 1990 enactment of a comprehensive scheme to regulate pollutants that depleted the ozone layer, see Title VI, 104 Stat. 2649, 42 U.

S. 120</a> (2000).  In that case, relying on \xe2\x80\x9ctobacco[\xe2\x80\x99s] unique political history,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 159, we invalidated the Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on its general authority to regulate drugs as a basis for asserting jurisdiction over an \xe2\x80\x9cindustry constituting a significant portion of the American economy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA reasoned that climate change had its own \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical history\xe2\x80\x9d: Congress designed the original Clean Air Act to address <em>local </em>air pollutants rather than a substance that \xe2\x80\x9cis fairly consistent in its concentration throughout the <em>world\xe2\x80\x99s </em>atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d 68 Fed. Reg. 52927 (emphasis added); declined in 1990 to enact proposed amendments to force EPA to set carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles, <em>ibid.</em> (citing H.\xc2\xa0R. 5966, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990)); and addressed global climate change in other legislation, 68 Fed. Reg. 52927.  Because of this political history, and because imposing emission limitations on greenhouse gases would have even greater economic and political repercussions than regulating tobacco, EPA was persuaded that it lacked the power to do so.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52928.  In essence, EPA concluded that climate change was so important that unless Congress spoke with exacting specificity, it could not have meant the agency to address it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having reached that conclusion, EPA believed it followed that greenhouse gases cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cIt follows from this conclusion, that [greenhouse gases], as such, are not air pollutants under the [Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s] regulatory provisions \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  The agency bolstered this conclusion by explaining that if carbon dioxide were an air pollutant, the only feasible method of reducing tailpipe emissions would be to improve fuel economy.  But because Congress has already created detailed mandatory fuel economy standards subject to Department of Transportation (DOT) administration, the agency concluded that EPA regulation would either conflict with those standards or be superfluous.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52929.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that it had authority over greenhouse gases, EPA explained in detail why it would refuse to exercise that authority.  The agency began by recognizing that the concentration of greenhouse gases has dramatically increased as a result of human activities, and acknowledged the attendant increase in global surface air temperatures.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52930.  EPA nevertheless gave controlling importance to the NRC Report\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a causal link between the two \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cannot be unequivocally established.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting NRC Report 17).  Given that residual uncertainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas emissions would be unwise.  68 Fed. Reg. 52930.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The agency furthermore characterized any EPA regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a \xe2\x80\x9cpiecemeal approach\xe2\x80\x9d to climate change, <em>id.,</em> at 52931, and stated that such regulation would conflict with the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive approach\xe2\x80\x9d to the problem, <em>id.,</em> at 52932.  That approach involves additional support for technological innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further research on climate change\xe2\x80\x94not actual regulation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52932\xe2\x80\x9352933.  According to EPA, unilateral EPA regulation of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might also hamper the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to persuade key developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 52931.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, now joined by intervenor States and local governments, sought review of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Although each of the three judges on the panel wrote a separate opinion, two judges agreed \xe2\x80\x9cthat the EPA Administrator properly exercised his discretion under \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) in denying the petition for rule making.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 F. 3d 50, 58 (2005).  The court therefore denied the petition for review.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In his opinion announcing the court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, Judge Randolph avoided a definitive ruling as to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 standing, <em>id.,</em> at 56, reasoning that it was permissible to proceed to the merits because the standing and the merits inquiries \xe2\x80\x9coverlap[ped],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Assuming without deciding that the statute authorized the EPA Administrator to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that \xe2\x80\x9cin his judgment\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9creasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.

Given that framework, it was reasonable for EPA to base its decision on scientific uncertainty as well as on other factors, including the concern that unilateral regulation of U. S. motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from other countries.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Sentelle wrote separately because he believed petitioners failed to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[e] the element of injury necessary to establish standing under Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 59 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judgment).  In his view, they had alleged that global warming is \xe2\x80\x9charmful to humanity at large,\xe2\x80\x9d but could not allege \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized injuries\xe2\x80\x9d to themselves.  <em>Id.,</em> at  60 (citing <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 562 (1992)).  While he dissented on standing, however, he accepted the contrary view as the law of the case and joined Judge Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred.  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Tatel dissented.  Emphasizing that EPA nowhere challenged the factual basis of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 affidavits, <em>id.,</em> at 66, he concluded that at least Massachusetts had \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied each element of Article III standing\xe2\x80\x94injury, causation, and redressability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 64.  In Judge Tatel\xe2\x80\x99s view, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial probability,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 66, that projected rises in sea level would lead to serious loss of coastal property was a \xe2\x80\x9cfar cry\xe2\x80\x9d from the kind of generalized harm insufficient to ground Article III jurisdiction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 65.  He found that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 affidavits more than adequately supported the conclusion that EPA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions contributed to the sea level changes that threatened Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 coastal property.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As to redressability, he observed that one of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 experts, a former EPA climatologist, stated that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]chievable reductions in emissions of CO<font super="-1">2 and other [greenhouse gases] from U.

He further noted that the one-time director of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s motor-vehicle pollution control efforts stated in an affidavit that enforceable emission standards would lead to the development of new technologies that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would gradually be mandated by other countries around the world.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 66 (quoting declaration of Michael Walsh \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb67\xe2\x80\x938, 10, Stdg.

On the merits, Judge Tatel explained at length why he believed the text of the statute provided EPA with authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and why its policy concerns did not justify its refusal to exercise that authority.  415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 67\xe2\x80\x9382.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article III of the Constitution limits federal-court jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those two words confine \xe2\x80\x9cthe business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html">392 U.

This case suffers from none of these defects.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute turns on the proper construction of a congressional statute, a question eminently suitable to resolution in federal court.  Congress has moreover authorized this type of challenge to EPA action.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(1).  That authorization is of critical importance to the standing inquiry: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U. S., at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We will not, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9centertain citizen suits to vindicate the public\xe2\x80\x99s nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 581.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA maintains that because greenhouse gas emissions inflict widespread harm, the doctrine of standing presents an insuperable jurisdictional obstacle.  We do not agree.  At bottom, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gist of the question of standing\xe2\x80\x9d is whether petitioners have \xe2\x80\x9csuch a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Carr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/index.html">369 U. S. 186</a>, 204 (1962).  As Justice Kennedy explained in his <em>Lujan</em> concurrence:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhile it does not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action, the party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.  This requirement is not just an empty formality.  It preserves the vitality of the adversarial process by assuring both that the parties before the court have an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome, and that the legal questions presented \xe2\x80\xa6 will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To ensure the proper adversarial presentation, <em>Lujan</em> holds that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury.  See <em>id.</em>, at 560\xe2\x80\x93561.  However, a litigant to whom Congress has \xe2\x80\x9caccorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 572, n. 7\xe2\x80\x94here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, \xc2\xa77607(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Fla.</em> v. <em>Veneman</em>, 289 F. 3d 89, 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (CADC 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cA [litigant] who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled never has to prove that if he had received the procedure the substantive result would have been altered.  All that is necessary is to show that the procedural step was connected to the substantive result\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review.  See <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/47/index.html">547 U. S. 47</a>, 52, n.\xc2\xa02 (2006).  We stress here, as did Judge Tatel below, the special position and interest of Massachusetts.  It is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not, as it was in <em>Lujan</em>, a private individual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well before the creation of the modern administrative state, we recognized that States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.  As Justice Holmes explained in <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Tennessee Copper Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/index.html"></a><a href="/us/206/230/index.html">206 U.

The very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are wanting here.  The State owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small.  This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of <em>quasi-</em>sovereign.  In that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.  It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nJust as Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindependent interest \xe2\x80\xa6 in all the earth and air within its domain\xe2\x80\x9d supported federal jurisdiction a century ago, so too does Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 well-founded desire to preserve its sovereign territory today.

That Massachusetts does in fact own a great deal of the \xe2\x80\x9cterritory alleged to be affected\xe2\x80\x9d only reinforces the conclusion that its stake in the outcome of this case is sufficiently concrete to warrant the exercise of federal judicial power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a State enters the Union, it surrenders certain sovereign prerogatives.  Massachusetts cannot invade Rhode Island to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it cannot negotiate an emissions treaty with China or India, and in some circumstances the exercise of its police powers to reduce in-state motor-vehicle emissions might well be pre-empted.

For the same reason, EPA does not believe that any realistic possibility exists that the relief petitioners seek would mitigate global climate change and remedy their injuries.

Its argument rests on the erroneous assumption that a small incremental step, because it is incremental, can never be attacked in a federal judicial forum.  Yet accepting that premise would doom most challenges to regulatory action.  Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell regulatory swoop.  See Williamson</em> v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/483/index.html">348 U.

They instead whittle away at them over time, refining their preferred approach as circumstances change and as they develop a more-nuanced understanding of how best to proceed.  Cf. <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/194/index.html">332 U.

That a first step might be tentative does not by itself support the notion that federal courts lack jurisdiction to determine whether that step conforms to law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly a tentative step.  Even leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the United States transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x94according to the MacCracken affidavit, more than 1.7 billion metric tons in 1999 alone.  \xc2\xb630, Stdg.

To put this in perspective: Considering just emissions from the transportation sector, which represent less than one-third of this country\xe2\x80\x99s total carbon dioxide emissions, the United States would still rank as the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, outpaced only by the European Union and China.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Judged by any standard, U.

Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with man-made climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We moreover attach considerable significance to EPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cagree[ment] with the President that \xe2\x80\x98we must address the issue of global climate change,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 68 Fed.

The risk of catastrophic harm, though remote, is nevertheless real.  That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek.  We therefore hold that petitioners have standing to challenge the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of their rulemaking petition.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The scope of our review of the merits of the statutory issues is narrow.  As we have repeated time and again, an agency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated responsibilities.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/837/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93845 (1984).  That discretion is at its height when the agency decides not to bring an enforcement action.  Therefore, in <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/821/index.html">470 U. S. 821</a> (1985), we held that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review.  Some debate remains, however, as to the rigor with which we review an agency\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a petition for rulemaking.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are key differences between a denial of a petition for rulemaking and an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to initiate an enforcement action.  See <em>American Horse Protection Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Lyng</em>, 812 F. 2d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (CADC 1987).  In contrast to nonenforcement decisions, agency refusals to initiate rulemaking \xe2\x80\x9care less frequent, more apt to involve legal as opposed to factual analysis, and subject to special formalities, including a public explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4; see also 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7555(e).  They moreover arise out of denials of petitions for rulemaking which (at least in the circumstances here) the affected party had an undoubted procedural right to file in the first instance.  Refusals to promulgate rules are thus susceptible to judicial review, though such review is \xe2\x80\x9cextremely limited\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chighly deferential.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Assn of America, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 883 F. 2d 93, 96 (CADC 1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA concluded in its denial of the petition for rulemaking that it lacked authority under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1) to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in \xc2\xa77602.  In the alternative, it concluded that even if it possessed authority, it would decline to do so because regulation would conflict with other administration priorities.  As discussed earlier, the Clean Air Act expressly permits review of such an action.  \xc2\xa77607(b)(1).  We therefore \xe2\x80\x9cmay reverse any such action found to be \xe2\x80\xa6 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77607(d)(9).</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the merits, the first question is whether \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d that such emissions contribute to climate change.  We have little trouble concluding that it does.  In relevant part, \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) provides that EPA \xe2\x80\x9cshall by regulation prescribe \xe2\x80\xa6 standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in [the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1).  Because EPA believes that Congress did not intend it to regulate substances that contribute to climate change, the agency maintains that carbon dioxide is not an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the provision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory text forecloses EPA\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  The Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including <em>any</em> physical, chemical \xe2\x80\xa6 substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77602(g) (emphasis added).  On its face, the definition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe, and underscores that intent through the repeated use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt \xe2\x80\x9cphysical [and] chemical \xe2\x80\xa6 substance[s] which [are] emitted into \xe2\x80\xa6 the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute is unambiguous.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than relying on statutory text, EPA invokes postenactment congressional actions and deliberations it views as tantamount to a congressional command to refrain from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.  Even if such postenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA never identifies any action remotely suggesting that Congress meant to curtail its power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants.  That subsequent Congresses have eschewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it amended \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) in 1970 and 1977.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  And unlike EPA, we have no difficulty reconciling Congress\xe2\x80\x99 various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and research to better understand climate change[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing mandate to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d that may endanger the public welfare.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77601(a)(1).  Collaboration and research do not conflict with any thoughtful regulatory effort; they complement it.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, is similarly misplaced.  In holding that tobacco products are not \xe2\x80\x9cdrugs\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdevices\xe2\x80\x9d subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), see 529 U. S., at 133, we found critical at least two considerations that have no counterpart in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we thought it unlikely that Congress meant to ban tobacco products, which the FDCA would have required had such products been classified as \xe2\x80\x9cdrugs\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdevices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 135\xe2\x80\x93137.  Here, in contrast, EPA jurisdiction would lead to no such extreme measures.  EPA would only <em>regulate </em>emissions, and even then, it would have to delay any action \xe2\x80\x9cto permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77521(a)(2).  However much a ban on tobacco products clashed with the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d intuition that Congress never meant to remove those products from circulation, <em>Brown &amp; Williamson</em>, 529 U. S., at 133<em>,</em> there is nothing counterintuitive to the notion that EPA can curtail the emission of substances that are putting the global climate out of kilter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in <em>Brown &amp; Williamson</em> we pointed to an unbroken series of congressional enactments that made sense only if adopted \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the backdrop of the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s consistent and repeated statements that it lacked authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 144.  We can point to no such enactments here: EPA has not identified any congressional action that conflicts in any way with the regulation of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles.  Even if it had, Congress could not have acted against a regulatory \xe2\x80\x9cbackdrop\xe2\x80\x9d of disclaimers of regulatory authority.  Prior to the order that provoked this litigation, EPA had never disavowed the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, and in 1998 it in fact affirmed that it <em>had</em> such authority.  See App. 54 (Cannon memorandum).  There is no reason, much less a compelling reason, to accept EPA\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to read ambiguity into a clear statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA finally argues that it cannot regulate carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles because doing so would require it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that Congress has assigned to DOT.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 52929.  But that DOT sets mileage standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibilities.  EPA has been charged with protecting the public\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of DOT\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to promote energy efficiency.  See Energy Policy and Conservation Act, \xc2\xa72(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76201(5).  The two obligations may overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Congresses that drafted \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) might not have appreciated the possibility that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming, they did understand that without regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scientific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act obsolete.  The broad language of \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) reflects an intentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsolescence.  See <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U. S. 206</a>, 212 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.  It demonstrates breadth\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s capacious definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant,\xe2\x80\x9d we hold that EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases from new motor vehicles.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The alternative basis for EPA\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94that even if it does have statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do so at this time\xe2\x80\x94rests on reasoning divorced from the statutory text.  While the statute does condition the exercise of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority on its formation of a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1), that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant \xe2\x80\x9ccause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Put another way, the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text.  It is but a direction to exercise discretion within defined statutory limits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from new motor vehicles.  <em>Ibid.</em> (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[EPA] shall by regulation prescribe \xe2\x80\xa6 standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class of new motor vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d).  EPA no doubt has significant latitude as to the manner, timing, content, and coordination of its regulations with those of other agencies.  But once EPA has responded to a petition for rulemaking, its reasons for action or inaction must conform to the authorizing statute.  Under the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.  <em>Ibid.</em>  To the extent that this constrains agency discretion to pursue other priorities of the Administrator or the President, this is the congressional design.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA has refused to comply with this clear statutory command.  Instead, it has offered a laundry list of reasons not to regulate.  For example, EPA said that a number of voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to the threat of global warming, 68 Fed. Reg. 52932, that regulating greenhouse gases might impair the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to negotiate with \xe2\x80\x9ckey developing nations\xe2\x80\x9d to reduce emissions, <em>id.</em>, at 52931, and that curtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect \xe2\x80\x9can inefficient, piecemeal approach to address the climate change issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have neither the expertise nor the authority to evaluate these policy judgments, it is evident they have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change.  Still less do they amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment.  In particular, while the President has broad authority in foreign affairs, that authority does not extend to the refusal to execute domestic laws.  In the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, Congress authorized the State Department\xe2\x80\x94not EPA\xe2\x80\x94to formulate United States foreign policy with reference to environmental matters relating to climate.  See \xc2\xa71103(c), 101 Stat. 1409.  EPA has made no showing that it issued the ruling in question here after consultation with the State Department.  Congress did direct EPA to consult with other agencies in the formulation of its policies and rules, but the State Department is absent from that list.  \xc2\xa71103(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 52930\xe2\x80\x9352931.  If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so.  That EPA would prefer not to regulate greenhouse gases because of some residual uncertainty\xe2\x80\x94which, contrary to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s apparent belief, <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x938, is in fact all that it said, see 68 Fed. Reg. 52929 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not believe . . . that it would be either effective or appropriate for EPA <em>to establish [greenhouse gas] standards for motor vehicles</em> at this time\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added))\xe2\x80\x94is irrelevant.  The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change.  Its action was therefore \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, \xe2\x80\xa6 or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(d)(9)(A).  We need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding, or whether policy concerns can inform EPA\xe2\x80\x99s actions in the event that it makes such a finding.

Indeed, it may ultimately affect nearly everyone on the planet in some potentially adverse way, and it may be that governments have done too little to address it.

I would reject these challenges as nonjusticiable.  Such a conclusion involves no judgment on whether global warming exists, what causes it, or the extent of the problem.  Nor does it render petitioners without recourse.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s standing jurisprudence simply recognizes that redress of grievances of the sort at issue here \xe2\x80\x9cis the function of Congress and the Chief Executive,\xe2\x80\x9d not the federal courts.  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html"></a><a href="/us/504/555/index.html">504 U.

S. 83</a>, 102 (1998), and has been described as \xe2\x80\x9can essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 560.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our modern framework for addressing standing is familiar: \xe2\x80\x9cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DaimlerChrysler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U. S. 737</a>, 751 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Applying that standard here, petitioners bear the burden of alleging an injury that is fairly traceable to the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that is likely to be redressed by the prospective issuance of such standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before determining whether petitioners can meet this familiar test, however, the Court changes the rules.  It asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cStates are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d and that given \xe2\x80\x9cMassachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests, the Commonwealth is entitled to <em>special solicitude</em> in our standing analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15, 17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relaxing Article III standing requirements because asserted injuries are pressed by a State, however, has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for any such \xe2\x80\x9cspecial solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d is conspicuously absent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The general judicial review provision cited by the Court, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(1), affords States no special rights or status.  The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others)\xe2\x80\x9d through the statutory provision at issue, \xc2\xa77521(a)(1), and that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has . . . recognized a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  The reader might think from this unfortunate phrasing that Congress said something about the rights of States in this particular provision of the statute.  Congress knows how to do that when it wants to, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa77426(b) (affording States the right to petition EPA to directly regulate certain sources of pollution), but it has done nothing of the sort here.  Under the law on which petitioners rely, Congress treated public and private litigants exactly the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the case law cited by the Court provide any support for the notion that Article III somehow implicitly treats public and private litigants differently.  The Court has to go back a full century in an attempt to justify its novel standing rule, but even there it comes up short.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis hinges on <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Tennessee Copper Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/230/index.html">206 U. S. 230</a> (1907)\xe2\x80\x94a case that did indeed draw a distinction between a State and private litigants, but solely with respect to available remedies.  The case had nothing to do with Article III standing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Tennessee Copper</em>, the State of Georgia sought to enjoin copper companies in neighboring Tennessee from discharging pollutants that were inflicting \xe2\x80\x9ca wholesale destruction of forests, orchards and crops\xe2\x80\x9d in bordering Georgia counties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 236.  Although the State owned very little of the territory allegedly affected, the Court reasoned that Georgia\xe2\x80\x94in its capacity as a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>quasi</em>-sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 237.  The Court explained that while \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief [were] wanting,\xe2\x80\x9d a State \xe2\x80\x9cis not lightly to be required to give up <em>quasi</em>-sovereign rights for pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus while a complaining private litigant would have to make do with a <em>legal </em>remedy\xe2\x80\x94one \xe2\x80\x9cfor pay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the State was entitled to <em>equitable </em>relief.  See <em>id.</em>, at 237\xe2\x80\x93238.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the present case, there was no question in <em>Tennessee Copper </em>about Article III injury.  See<em> id.</em>, at 238\xe2\x80\x93239.  There was certainly no suggestion that the State could show standing where the private parties could not; there was no dispute, after all, that the private landowners had \xe2\x80\x9can action at law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 238.  <em>Tennessee Copper</em> has since stood for nothing more than a State\xe2\x80\x99s right, in an original jurisdiction action, to sue in a representative capacity as <em>parens patriae</em>.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/index.html">451 U. S. 725</a>, 737 (1981).  Nothing about a State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sue in that capacity dilutes the bedrock requirement of showing injury, causation, and redressability to satisfy Article III.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A claim of <em>parens patriae </em>standing is distinct from an allegation of direct injury.  See <em>Wyoming</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/437/index.html">502 U. S. 437</a>, 448\xe2\x80\x93449, 451 (1992).  Far from being a substitute for Article III injury, <em>parens patriae</em> actions raise an additional hurdle for a state litigant: the articulation of a \xe2\x80\x9cquasi-sovereign interest\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c<em>apart</em> from the interests of particular private parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son, Inc.</em> v. <em>Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/592/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/592/index.html">458 U. S. 592</a>, 607 (1982) (emphasis added) (cited <em>ante</em>, at 16).  Just as an association suing on behalf of its members must show not only that it represents the members but that at least one satisfies Article III requirements, so too a State asserting quasi-sovereign interests as <em>parens patriae</em> must still show that its citizens satisfy Article III.  Focusing on Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99s interests as quasi-sovereign makes the required showing here harder, not easier.  The Court, in effect, takes what has always been regarded as a <em>necessary</em> condition for <em>parens patriae </em>standing\xe2\x80\x94a quasi-sovereign interest\xe2\x80\x94and converts it into a <em>sufficient</em> showing for purposes of Article III.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is more, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning falters on its own terms.  The Court asserts that Massachusetts is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d due to its \xe2\x80\x9cquasi-sovereign interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 17, but then applies our Article III standing test to the asserted injury of the State\xe2\x80\x99s loss of coastal property.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19 (concluding that Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x9chas alleged a particularized injury <em>in its capacity as a landowner</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  In the context of <em>parens patriae</em> standing, however, we have characterized state ownership of land as a \xe2\x80\x9cnonsovereign interes[t]\xe2\x80\x9d because a State \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to have the same interests as other similarly situated proprietors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 601.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On top of everything else, the Court overlooks the fact that our cases cast significant doubt on a State\xe2\x80\x99s standing to assert a quasi-sovereign interest\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to a direct injury\xe2\x80\x94against the Federal Government.  As a general rule, we have held that while a State might assert a quasi-sovereign right as <em>parens patriae</em> \xe2\x80\x9cfor the protection of its citizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the Federal Government.  In that field it is the United States, and not the State, which represents them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a>, 485\xe2\x80\x93486 (1923) (citation omitted); see also <em>Alfred L. Snapp &amp; Son</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 610, n.\xc2\xa016.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of this presumably explains why petitioners never cited <em>Tennessee Copper </em>in their briefs before this Court or the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  It presumably explains why not one of the legion of <em>amici</em> supporting petitioners ever cited the case.  And it presumably explains why not one of the three judges writing below ever cited the case either.  Given that one purpose of the standing requirement is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (quoting <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Carr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/index.html">369 U. S. 186</a>, 204 (1962)), it is ironic that the Court today adopts a new theory of Article III standing for States without the benefit of briefing or argument on the point.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not at all clear how the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d for Massachusetts plays out in the standing analysis, except as an implicit concession that petitioners cannot establish standing on traditional terms.  But the status of Massachusetts as a State cannot compensate for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 failure to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Court actually applies the three-part test, it focuses, as did the dissent below, see 415 F. 3d 50, 64 (CADC 2005) (opinion of Tatel, J.), on the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted loss of coastal land as the injury in fact.  If petitioners rely on loss of land as the Article III injury, however, they must ground the rest of the standing analysis in that specific injury.  That alleged injury must be \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U. S., at 560, and \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct and palpable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Allen</em>, 468 U. S., at 751 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Central to this concept of \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized\xe2\x80\x9d injury is the requirement that a plaintiff be affected in a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal and individual way,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U. S., at 560, n.\xc2\xa01, and seek relief that \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly and tangibly benefits him\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner distinct from its impact on \xe2\x80\x9cthe public at large,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  Without \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized injury, there can be no confidence of \xe2\x80\x98a real need to exercise the power of judicial review\xe2\x80\x99 or that relief can be framed \xe2\x80\x98no broader than required by the precise facts to which the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling would be applied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U.

S. 208</a>, 221\xe2\x80\x93222 (1974)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The very concept of global warming seems inconsistent with this particularization requirement.  Global warming is a phenomenon \xe2\x80\x9charmful to humanity at large,\xe2\x80\x9d 415 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 60 (Sentelle, J., dissenting in part and concurring in judgment), and the redress petitioners seek is focused no more on them than on the public generally\xe2\x80\x94it is literally to change the atmosphere around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 particularized injury is loss of coastal land, it is also that injury that must be \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Defenders of Wildlife, supra</em>, at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted), \xe2\x80\x9creal and immediate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 102 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Whitmore</em> v. <em>Arkansas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/149/index.html"></a><a href="/us/495/149/index.html">495 U. S. 149</a>, 158 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d injury, the Court observes that \xe2\x80\x9cglobal sea levels rose somewhere between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hese rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 coastal land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  But none of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 declarations supports that connection.  One declaration states that \xe2\x80\x9ca rise in sea level due to climate change is occurring on the coast of Massachusetts, in the metropolitan Boston area,\xe2\x80\x9d but there is no elaboration.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Standing Appendix in No. 03\xe2\x80\x931361, etc. (CADC), p. 196 (Stdg. App.).  And the declarant goes on to identify a \xe2\x80\x9csignifican[t]\xe2\x80\x9d <em>non</em>-global-warming cause of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s rising sea level: land subsidence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 197; see also <em>id.</em>, at 216.  Thus, aside from a single conclusory statement, there is nothing in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 43 standing declarations and accompanying exhibits to support an inference of actual loss of Massachusetts coastal land from 20th century global sea level increases.  It is pure conjecture.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to identify \xe2\x80\x9cimminent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly impending\xe2\x80\x9d loss of Massachusetts coastal land fares no better.  See<em> ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  One of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 declarants predicts global warming will cause sea level to rise by 20 to 70 centimeters <em>by the year 2100</em>.  Stdg. App. 216.  Another uses a computer modeling program to map the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s coastal land and its current elevation, and calculates that the high-end estimate of sea level rise would result in the loss of significant state-owned coastal land.  <em>Id.</em>, at 179.  But the computer modeling program has a conceded average error of about 30 centimeters and a maximum observed error of 70 centimeters.  <em>Id.</em>, at 177\xe2\x80\x93178.  As an initial matter, if it is possible that the model underrepresents the elevation of coastal land to an extent equal to or in excess of the projected sea level rise, it is difficult to put much stock in the predicted loss of land.  But even placing that problem to the side, accepting a century-long time horizon and a series of compounded estimates renders requirements of imminence and immediacy utterly toothless.  See <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 565, n.\xc2\xa02 (while the concept of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98imminence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in standing doctrine is \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat elastic,\xe2\x80\x9d it can be \xe2\x80\x9cstretched beyond the breaking point\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cAllegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art.

To establish standing, petitioners must show a causal connection between that specific injury and the lack of new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and that the promulgation of such standards would likely redress that injury.  As is often the case, the questions of causation and redressability overlap.  See <em>Allen</em>, 468 U. S., at 753, n.\xc2\xa019 (observing that the two requirements were \xe2\x80\x9cinitially articulated by this Court as two facets of a single causation requirement\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And importantly, when a party is challenging the Government\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unlawful regulation, or lack of regulation, of a third party, satisfying the causation and redressability requirements becomes \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Warth</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 504\xe2\x80\x93505.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners view the relationship between their injuries and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to promulgate new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards as simple and direct: Domestic motor vehicles emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore also to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injuries.  Without the new vehicle standards, greenhouse gas emissions\xe2\x80\x94and therefore global warming and its attendant harms\xe2\x80\x94have been higher than they otherwise would have been; once EPA changes course, the trend will be reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court ignores the complexities of global warming, and does so by now disregarding the \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized\xe2\x80\x9d injury it relied on in step one, and using the dire nature of global warming itself as a bootstrap for finding causation and redressability.  First, it is important to recognize the extent of the emissions at issue here.  Because local greenhouse gas emissions disperse throughout the atmosphere and remain there for anywhere from 50 to 200 years, it is global emissions data that are relevant.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9373.  According to one of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 declarations, domestic motor vehicles contribute about 6 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Stdg. App. 232.  The amount of global emissions at issue here is smaller still; \xc2\xa7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act covers only <em>new </em>motor vehicles and <em>new</em> motor vehicle engines, so petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 desired emission standards might reduce only a fraction of 4 percent of global emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This gets us only to the relevant greenhouse gas emissions; linking them to global warming and ultimately to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injuries next requires consideration of further complexities.  As EPA explained in its denial of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request for rulemaking,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cpredicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of [greenhouse gases] and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (e.g., what percentage are absorbed by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (e.g., changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (e.g., average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (e.g., shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (e.g., increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts).\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9383 through A\xe2\x80\x9384.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are never able to trace their alleged injuries back through this complex web to the fractional amount of global emissions that might have been limited with EPA standards.  In light of the bit-part domestic new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions have played in what petitioners describe as a 150-year global phenomenon, and the myriad additional factors bearing on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injury\xe2\x80\x94the loss of Massachusetts coastal land\xe2\x80\x94the connection is far too speculative to establish causation.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Redressability is even more problematic.  To the tenuous link between petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injury and the indeterminate fractional domestic emissions at issue here, add the fact that petitioners cannot meaningfully predict what will come of the 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions that originate outside the United States.  As the Court acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 23, so the domestic emissions at issue here may become an increasingly marginal portion of global emissions, and any decreases produced by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 desired standards are likely to be overwhelmed many times over by emissions increases elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners offer declarations attempting to address this uncertainty, contending that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the U. S. takes steps to reduce motor vehicle emissions, other countries are very likely to take similar actions regarding their own motor vehicles using technology developed in response to the U. S. program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stdg. App. 220; see also <em>id.</em>, at 311\xe2\x80\x93312.  In other words, do not worry that other countries will contribute far more to global warming than will U. S. automobile emissions; someone is bound to invent something, and places like the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China or India will surely require use of the new technology, regardless of cost.  The Court previously has explained that when the existence of an element of standing \xe2\x80\x9cdepends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,\xe2\x80\x9d a party must present facts supporting an assertion that the actor will proceed in such a manner.  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U. S., at 562 (quoting <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html">490 U. S. 605</a>, 615 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); internal quotation marks omitted).  The declarations\xe2\x80\x99 conclusory (not to say fanciful) statements do not even come close.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No matter, the Court reasons, because <em>any</em> decrease in domestic emissions will \xe2\x80\x9cslow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  Every little bit helps, so Massachusetts can sue over any little bit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s sleight-of-hand is in failing to link up the different elements of the three-part standing test.  What must be <em>likely</em> to be redressed is the particular injury in fact.  The injury the Court looks to is the asserted loss of land.  The Court contends that regulating domestic motor vehicle emissions will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, <em>and therefore</em> redress Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  But even if regulation <em>does</em> reduce emissions\xe2\x80\x94to some indeterminate degree, given events elsewhere in the world\xe2\x80\x94the Court never explains why that makes it <em>likely</em> that the injury in fact\xe2\x80\x94the loss of land\xe2\x80\x94will be redressed.  Schoolchildren know that a kingdom might be lost \xe2\x80\x9call for the want of a horseshoe nail,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d redressability is a different matter.  The realities make it pure conjecture to suppose that EPA regulation of new automobile emissions will <em>likely </em>prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 difficulty in demonstrating causation and redressability is not surprising given the evident mismatch between the source of their alleged injury\xe2\x80\x94catastrophic global warming\xe2\x80\x94and the narrow subject matter of the Clean Air Act provision at issue in this suit.  The mismatch suggests that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 true goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else.  The constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases\xe2\x80\x94not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates.  See <em>Valley Forge Christian College</em> v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/index.html">454 U.

But in considering how loosely or rigorously to define those adverbs, it is vital to keep in mind the purpose of the inquiry.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision recalls the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP)</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/index.html">412 U. S. 669</a> (1973).  <em>SCRAP</em> involved \xe2\x80\x9c[p]robably the most attenuated injury conferring Art. III standing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csurely went to the very outer limit of the law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94until today.  <em>Whitmore</em>, 495 U.

S. 871</a>, 889 (1990) (<em>SCRAP</em> \xe2\x80\x9chas never since been emulated by this Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>SCRAP</em>, the Court based an environmental group\xe2\x80\x99s standing to challenge a railroad freight rate surcharge on the group\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that increases in railroad rates would cause an increase in the use of nonrecyclable goods, resulting in the increased need for natural resources to produce such goods.  According to the group, some of these resources might be taken from the Washington area, resulting in increased refuse that might find its way into area parks, harming the group\xe2\x80\x99s members.  412 U.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is <em>SCRAP </em>for a new generation.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the Court recognizes as much.  How else to explain its need to devise a new doctrine of state standing to support its result?  The good news is that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecial solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d for Massachusetts limits the future applicability of the diluted standing requirements applied in this case.  The bad news is that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s self-professed relaxation of those Article III requirements has caused us to transgress \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper\xe2\x80\x94and properly limited\xe2\x80\x94role of the courts in a democratic society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em>, 468 U.

The point is that nothing in our cases (or Hart &amp; Wechsler) suggests that the prudential requirements for <em>parens patriae </em>standing, see <em>Republic of Venezuela</em> v. <em>Philip Morris Inc.</em>, 287 F.\xc2\xa03d 192, 199, n.

As the caption makes clear enough, the fact that a State may assert rights under a federal statute as <em>parens patriae</em> in no way refutes our clear ruling that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] State does not have standing as <em>parens patriae</em> to bring an action against the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alfred L.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1) (emphasis added).  As the Court recognizes, the statute \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] the exercise of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority on its formation of a \xe2\x80\x98judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.  There is no dispute that the Administrator has made no such judgment in this case.  See <em>ante,</em> at 32 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe need not and do not reach the question whether on remand EPA must make an endangerment finding\xe2\x80\x9d); 68 Fed. 52929 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o Administrator has made a finding under any of the CAA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory provisions that CO<font super="-1">2 meets the applicable statutory criteria for regulation\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question thus arises: Does anything <em>require</em> the Administrator to make a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d whenever a petition for rulemaking is filed?  Without citation of the statute or any other authority, the Court says yes.  Why is that so?  When Congress wishes to make private action force an agency\xe2\x80\x99s hand, it knows how to do so.  See, <em>e.g., Brock</em> v. <em>Pierce County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/253/index.html">476 U. S. 253</a>, 254\xe2\x80\x93255 (1986) (discussing the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), 92 Stat. 1926, 29 U.

Where does the CAA say that the EPA Administrator is required to come to a decision on this question whenever a rulemaking petition is filed?  The Court points to no such provision because none exists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the Court invents a multiple-choice question that the EPA Administrator must answer when a petition for rulemaking is filed.  The Administrator must exercise his judgment in one of three ways: (a) by concluding that the pollutant <em>does</em> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is required to regulate); (b) by concluding that the pollutant <em>does not</em> cause, or contribute to, air pollution that endangers public welfare (in which case EPA is <em>not</em> required to regulate); or (c) by \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether\xe2\x80\x9d greenhouse gases endanger public welfare, <em>ante</em>, at 30, (in which case EPA is <em>not </em>required to regulate).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in this regard is not entirely unbounded\xe2\x80\x94that if he has no reasonable basis for deferring judgment he must grasp the nettle at once.  The Court, however, with no basis in text or precedent, rejects all of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s stated \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy judgments\xe2\x80\x9d as not \xe2\x80\x9camount[ing] to a reasoned justification,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 31, effectively narrowing the universe of potential reasonable bases to a single one: Judgment can be delayed <em>only</em> if the Administrator concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe scientific uncertainty is [too] profound.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

S. motor vehicle fleet is one of many sources of [greenhouse gas] emissions both here and abroad, and different [greenhouse gas] emission sources face different technological and financial challenges in reducing emissions.  A sensible regulatory scheme would require that all significant sources and sinks of [greenhouse gas] emissions be considered in deciding how best to achieve any needed emission reductions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUnilateral EPA regulation of motor vehicle [greenhouse gas] emissions could also weaken U.

Considering the large populations and growing economies of some developing countries, increases in their [greenhouse gas] emissions could quickly overwhelm the effects of [greenhouse gas] reduction measures in developed countries.  Any potential benefit of EPA regulation could be lost to the extent other nations decided to let their emissions significantly increase in view of U. S. emissions reductions.

When the Administrator <em>makes</em> a judgment whether to regulate greenhouse gases, that judgment must relate to whether they are air pollutants that \xe2\x80\x9ccause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a)(1).  But the statute says <em>nothing at all </em>about the reasons for which the Administrator may <em>defer </em>making a judgment\xe2\x80\x94the permissible reasons for deciding not to grapple with the issue at the present time.  Thus, the various \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d rationales, <em>ante,</em> at 31, that the Court criticizes are not \xe2\x80\x9cdivorced from the statutory text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 30, except in the sense that the statutory text is silent, as texts are often silent about permissible reasons for the exercise of agency discretion.  The reasons the EPA gave are surely considerations executive agencies <em>regularly</em> take into account (and <em>ought </em>to take into account) when deciding whether to consider entering a new field: the impact such entry would have on other Executive Branch programs and on foreign policy.  There is no basis in law for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imposed limitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the discretion conferred by the statutory reference to \xe2\x80\x9cits judgment\xe2\x80\x9d is not only reasonable, it is the most natural reading of the text.  The Court nowhere explains why this interpretation is incorrect, let alone why it is not entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984).  As the Administrator acted within the law in declining to make a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d for the policy reasons above set forth, I would uphold the decision to deny the rulemaking petition on that ground alone.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own terms, however, the same conclusion follows.  As mentioned above, the Court gives EPA the option of determining that the science is too uncertain to allow it to form a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.  Attached to this option (on what basis is unclear) is an essay requirement: \xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31<em>.</em>  But EPA <em>has</em> said precisely that\xe2\x80\x94and at great length, based on information contained in a 2001 report by the National Research Council (NRC) entitled Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs the NRC noted in its report, concentrations of [greenhouse gases (GHGs)] are increasing in the atmosphere as a result of human activities (pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312).  It also noted that \xe2\x80\x98[a] diverse array of evidence points to a warming of global surface air temperatures\xe2\x80\x99 (p. 16).  The report goes on to state, however, that \xe2\x80\x98[b]ecause of the large and still uncertain level of natural variability inherent in the climate record and the uncertainties in the time histories of the various forcing agents (and particularly aerosols), a [causal] linkage between the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the observed climate changes during the 20th century cannot be unequivocally established.  The fact that the magnitude of the observed warming is large in comparison to natural variability as simulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it does not constitute proof of one because the model simulations could be deficient in natural variability on the decadal to century time scale\xe2\x80\x99 (p. 17).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe NRC also observed that \xe2\x80\x98there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions of [GHGs] and aerosols\xe2\x80\x99 (p. 1).  As a result of that uncertainty, the NRC cautioned that \xe2\x80\x98current estimate of the magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either upward or downward).\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Id.</em>  It further advised that \xe2\x80\x98[r]educing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions of global climate change will require major advances in understanding and modeling of both (1) the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of [GHGs] and aerosols and (2) the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfeedbacks\xe2\x80\x9d that determine the sensitivity of the climate system to a prescribed increase in [GHGs].\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Id.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe science of climate change is extraordinarily complex and still evolving.  Although there have been substantial advances in climate change science, there continue to be important uncertainties in our understanding of the factors that may affect future climate change and how it should be addressed.  As the NRC explained, predicting future climate change necessarily involves a complex web of economic and physical factors including: Our ability to predict future global anthropogenic emissions of GHGs and aerosols; the fate of these emissions once they enter the atmosphere (<em>e.g.,</em> what percentage are absorbed by vegetation or are taken up by the oceans); the impact of those emissions that remain in the atmosphere on the radiative properties of the atmosphere; changes in critically important climate feedbacks (<em>e.g.,</em> changes in cloud cover and ocean circulation); changes in temperature characteristics (<em>e.g.,</em> average temperatures, shifts in daytime and evening temperatures); changes in other climatic parameters (<em>e.g.,</em> shifts in precipitation, storms); and ultimately the impact of such changes on human health and welfare (<em>e.g.,</em> increases or decreases in agricultural productivity, human health impacts).  The NRC noted, in particular, that \xe2\x80\x98[t]he understanding of the relationships between weather/climate and human health is in its infancy and therefore the health consequences of climate change are poorly understood\xe2\x80\x99 (p. 20).  Substantial scientific uncertainties limit our ability to assess each of these factors and to separate out those changes resulting from natural variability from those that are directly the result of increases in anthropogenic GHGs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cReducing the wide range of uncertainty inherent in current model predictions will require major advances in understanding and modeling of the factors that determine atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and the processes that determine the sensitivity of the climate system.\xe2\x80\x9d  68 Fed. Reg. 52930.</p>\n<p align="left">\nI simply cannot conceive of what else the Court would like EPA to say.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even before reaching its discussion of the word \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court makes another significant error when it concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act <em>authorizes</em> EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a \xe2\x80\x98judgment\xe2\x80\x99 that such emissions contribute to climate change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 25 (emphasis added).  For such authorization, the Court relies on what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s capacious definition of \xe2\x80\x98air pollutant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 30.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAir pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by the Act as \xe2\x80\x9cany air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77602(g).  The Court is correct that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 26, fit within the second half of that definition: They are \xe2\x80\x9cphysical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance[s] or matter which [are] emitted into or otherwise ente[r] the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court mistakenly believes this to be the end of the analysis.  In order to be an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition, the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance or matter [being] emitted into \xe2\x80\xa6 the ambient air\xe2\x80\x9d must also meet the <em>first</em> half of the definition\xe2\x80\x94namely, it must be an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution agent or combination of such agents.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court simply pretends this half of the definition does not exist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis faithfully follows the argument advanced by petitioners, which focuses on the word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Petitioners 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  As that argument goes, anything that <em>follows</em> the word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding\xe2\x80\x9d must necessarily be a subset of whatever <em>precedes</em> it.  Thus, if greenhouse gases qualify under the phrase following the word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding,\xe2\x80\x9d they must qualify under the phrase preceding it.  Since greenhouse gases come within the capacious phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany physical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\xe2\x80\x9d they must also be \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution agent[s] or combination[s] of such agents,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore meet the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant[s].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is certainly one possible interpretation of the statutory definition.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding\xe2\x80\x9d can indeed indicate that what follows will be an \xe2\x80\x9cillustrative\xe2\x80\x9d sampling of the general category that precedes the word.  <em>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul</em> v. <em>Bismarck Lumber Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/314/95/index.html">314 U. S. 95</a>, 100 (1941).  Often, however, the examples standing alone are broader than the general category, and must be viewed as limited in light of that category.  The Government provides a helpful (and unanswered) example: \xe2\x80\x9cThe phrase \xe2\x80\x98any American automobile, including any truck or minivan,\xe2\x80\x99 would not naturally be construed to encompass a foreign-manufactured [truck or] minivan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondent 34.  The general principle enunciated\xe2\x80\x94that the speaker is talking about <em>American</em> automobiles\xe2\x80\x94carries forward to the illustrative examples (trucks and minivans), and limits them accordingly, even though in isolation they are broader.  Congress often uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cincluding\xe2\x80\x9d in this manner.  In 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(a), for example, it refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Certainly this provision would not encompass criminal investigations underway in a <em>domestic</em> tribunal.

It is perfectly reasonable to view the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d in its entirety: An air pollutant <em>can</em> be \xe2\x80\x9cany physical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air,\xe2\x80\x9d but only if it retains the general characteristic of being an \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution agent or combination of such agents.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is precisely the conclusion EPA reached: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] substance does not meet the CAA definition of \xe2\x80\x98air pollutant\xe2\x80\x99 simply because it is a \xe2\x80\x98physical, chemical, \xe2\x80\xa6 substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\xe2\x80\x99  It must also be an \xe2\x80\x98air pollution agent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  68 Fed.

Thus, in deciding whether it had authority to regulate, EPA had to determine whether the concentration of greenhouse gases assertedly responsible for \xe2\x80\x9cglobal climate change\xe2\x80\x9d qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution.\xe2\x80\x9d  EPA began with the commonsense observation that the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roblems associated with atmospheric concentrations of CO<font super="-1">2,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 52927, bear little resemblance to what would naturally be termed \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution\xe2\x80\x9d:</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEPA\xe2\x80\x99s prior use of the CAA\xe2\x80\x99s general regulatory provisions provides an important context.  Since the inception of the Act, EPA has used these provisions to address air pollution problems that occur primarily at ground level or near the surface of the earth.  For example, national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established under CAA section 109 address concentrations of substances in the ambient air and the related public health and welfare problems.  This has meant setting NAAQS for concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and other substances in the air near the surface of the earth, not higher in the atmosphere\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0CO<font super="-1">2, by contrast, is fairly consistent in concentration throughout the world\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere up to approximately the lower stratosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 52926\xe2\x80\x9352927.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, regulating the buildup of CO<font super="-1">2 and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, which is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is <em>polluting</em> the <em>air</em>.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need look no further than the dictionary for confirmation that this interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution\xe2\x80\x9d is eminently reasonable.
