V. FEDERAL ELECTIONCOMM\'N<br/>\n546 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC., APPELLANT <em>v.</em>\nFEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</p>\n<p align="left">on appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia</p>\n<p align="left">[January 23, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), \xc2\xa7203, 116 Stat. 91, prohibits corporations from using their general treasury funds to pay for any \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. III).  BCRA \xc2\xa7201 defines \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d as any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a candidate for federal office and that is broadcast within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction in which that candidate is running for office.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3).  Appellant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) brought this action against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking a judgment declaring BCRA unconstitutional as applied to several broadcast advertisements that it intended to run during the 2004 election.  WRTL also sought a preliminary injunction barring the FEC from enforcing BCRA against those advertisements. WRTL does not dispute that its advertisements are covered by BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of prohibited electioneering communications.  Instead, it contends that BCRA cannot be constitutionally applied to its particular communications because they constitute \xe2\x80\x9cgrassroots lobbying advertisements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the FEC has statutory authority to exempt by regulation certain communications from BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on electioneering communications, \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(B)(iv), at this point, it has not done so for the types of advertisements at issue here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge District Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and subsequently dismissed WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s complaint in an unpublished opinion.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 545 U. S. ___ (2005).  Appellant asks us to reverse the judgment of the District Court because that court incorrectly read a footnote in our opinion in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>, (2003), as foreclosing any \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied\xe2\x80\x9d challenges to the prohibition on electioneering communications.  We agree with WRTL that the District Court misinterpreted the relevance of our \xe2\x80\x9cuphold[ing] all applications of the primary definition\xe2\x80\x9d of electioneering communications.  <em>Id</em>., at 190, n. 73.  Contrary to the understanding of the District Court, that footnote merely notes that because we found BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s primary definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d facially valid when used with regard to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure and funding requirements, it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the backup definition Congress provided.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In upholding \xc2\xa7203 against a facial challenge, we did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FEC argues that the District Court also rested its decision on the alternative ground that the facts of this case \xe2\x80\x9csuggest that WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements may fit the very type of activity <em>McConnell</em> found Congress had a compelling interest in regulating.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 04\xe2\x80\x931260 (DC, Aug. 17, 2004), App. to Juris. Statement 8a.  It is not clear to us, however, that the District Court intended its opinion to rest on this ground.  For one thing, the court used the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay.\xe2\x80\x9d  For another, its separate opinion dismissing WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s challenge with prejudice characterized its previous opinion as holding that \xe2\x80\x9cWRTL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to BCRA is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>McConnell</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 3a.  Given this ambiguity, we cannot say with certainty that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal was based on this alternative ground.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied challenge in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
