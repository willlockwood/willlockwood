The Telecommunications Act of 1996 withdrew approval of the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 monopolies, \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally restructur[ing] local telephone markets\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csubject[ing] [ILECs] to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em> v. <em>Iowa Utilities Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/366/index.html">525 U.

The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that parallel business conduct allegations, taken alone, do not state a claim under \xc2\xa71; plaintiffs must allege additional facts tending to exclude independent self-interested conduct as an explanation for the parallel actions.  Reversing, the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 parallel conduct allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss because the ILECs failed to show that there is no set of facts that would permit plaintiffs to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Stating a \xc2\xa71 claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made.

S. 537</a>, 540.  While a showing of parallel \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which\xe2\x80\x9d agreement may be inferred, it falls short of \xe2\x80\x9cconclusively establish[ing] agreement or \xe2\x80\xa6 itself constitut[ing] a Sherman Act offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 540\xe2\x80\x93541.  The inadequacy of showing parallel conduct or interdependence, without more, mirrors the behavior\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguity: consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.  Thus, this Court has hedged against false inferences from identical behavior at a number of points in the trial sequence, <em>e.g., </em>at the summary judgment stage, see <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/574/index.html">475 U. S. 574</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This case presents the antecedent question of what a plaintiff must plead in order to state a \xc2\xa71 claim.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\xe2\x80\x9d in order to \xe2\x80\x9cgive the defendant fair notice of what the \xe2\x80\xa6 claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a>, 47.  While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, <em>ibid.,</em> a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide the \xe2\x80\x9cgrounds\xe2\x80\x9d of his \xe2\x80\x9centitle[ment] to relief\xe2\x80\x9d requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of a cause of action\xe2\x80\x99s elements will not do.  Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are true.  Applying these general standards to a \xc2\xa71 claim, stating a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter to suggest an agreement.  Asking for plausible grounds does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.  The need at the pleading stage for allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement reflects Rule 8(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s threshold requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cplain statement\xe2\x80\x9d possess enough heft to \xe2\x80\x9csho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  A parallel conduct allegation gets the \xc2\xa71 complaint close to stating a claim, but without further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.  The requirement of allegations suggesting an agreement serves the practical purpose of preventing a plaintiff with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a largely groundless claim\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tak[ing] up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an <em>in terrorem</em> increment of the settlement value.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals</em>,<em> Inc. </em>v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/336/index.html">544 U. S. 336</a>, 347.  It is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery, but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.  That potential expense is obvious here, where plaintiffs represent a putative class of at least 90 percent of subscribers to local telephone or high-speed Internet service in an action against America\xe2\x80\x99s largest telecommunications firms for unspecified instances of antitrust violations that allegedly occurred over a 7-year period.  It is no answer to say that a claim just shy of plausible entitlement can be weeded out early in the discovery process, given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been modest.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 main argument against the plausibility standard at the pleading stage is its ostensible conflict with a literal reading of <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement construing Rule 8: \xe2\x80\x9ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 U. S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  The \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d language has been questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough by courts and commentators, and is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.  <em>Conley</em> described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s survival.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Under the plausibility standard, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim of conspiracy in restraint of trade comes up short.  First, the complaint leaves no doubt that plaintiffs rest their \xc2\xa71 claim on descriptions of parallel conduct, not on any independent allegation of actual agreement among the ILECs.  The nub of the complaint is the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 parallel behavior, and its sufficiency turns on the suggestions raised by this conduct when viewed in light of common economic experience.  Nothing in the complaint invests either the action or inaction alleged with a plausible conspiracy suggestion.  As to the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 supposed agreement to disobey the 1996 Act and thwart the CLECs\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to compete, the District Court correctly found that nothing in the complaint intimates that resisting the upstarts was anything more than the natural, unilateral reaction of each ILEC intent on preserving its regional dominance.  The complaint\xe2\x80\x99s general collusion premise fails to answer the point that there was no need for joint encouragement to resist the 1996 Act, since each ILEC had reason to try and avoid dealing with CLECs and would have tried to keep them out, regardless of the other ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 second conspiracy theory rests on the competitive reticence among the ILECs themselves in the wake of the 1996 Act to enter into their competitors\xe2\x80\x99 territories, leaving the relevant market highly compartmentalized geographically, with minimal competition.  This parallel conduct did not suggest conspiracy, not if history teaches anything.  Monopoly was the norm in telecommunications, not the exception.  Because the ILECs were born in that world, doubtless liked it, and surely knew the adage about him who lives by the sword, a natural explanation for the noncompetition is that the former Government-sanctioned monopolists were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same.  Antitrust conspiracy was not suggested by the facts adduced under either theory of the complaint, which thus fails to state a valid \xc2\xa71 claim.  This analysis does not run counter to <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html">534 U. S. 506</a>, 508, which held that \xe2\x80\x9ca complaint in an employment discrimination lawsuit [need] not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, the Court is not requiring heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  Because the plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.

Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And, of course, a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and \xe2\x80\x9cthat a recovery is very remote and unlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render a \xc2\xa71 conspiracy plausible, we have the benefit of the prior rulings and considered views of leading commentators, already quoted, that lawful parallel conduct fails to bespeak unlawful agreement.  It makes sense to say, therefore, that an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice.  Without more, parallel conduct does not suggest conspiracy, and a conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply facts adequate to show illegality.  Hence, when allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to make a \xc2\xa71 claim, they must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The need at the pleading stage for allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement reflects the threshold requirement of Rule 8(a)(2) that the \xe2\x80\x9cplain statement\xe2\x80\x9d possess enough heft to \xe2\x80\x9csho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  A statement of parallel conduct, even conduct consciously undertaken, needs some setting suggesting the agreement necessary to make out a \xc2\xa71 claim; without that further circumstance pointing toward a meeting of the minds, an account of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s commercial efforts stays in neutral territory.  An allegation of parallel conduct is thus much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \xc2\xa71 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \xe2\x80\x9centitle[ment] to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>DM Research, Inc.</em> v. <em>College of Am.

Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court in <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson</em> spoke not only of the need for fair notice of the grounds for entitlement to relief but of \xe2\x80\x9cthe accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 U.

This \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d language can be read in isolation as saying that any statement revealing the theory of the claim will suffice unless its factual impossibility may be shown from the face of the pleadings; and the Court of Appeals appears to have read <em>Conley</em> in some such way when formulating its understanding of the proper pleading standard, see 425 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 106, 114 (invoking <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d language in describing the standard for dismissal).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On such a focused and literal reading of <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts,\xe2\x80\x9d a wholly conclusory statement of claim would survive a motion to dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some \xe2\x80\x9cset of [undisclosed] facts\xe2\x80\x9d to support recovery.

Thus, the complaint first takes account of the alleged \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of any meaningful competition between [the ILECs] in one another\xe2\x80\x99s markets,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe parallel course of conduct that each [ILEC] engaged in to prevent competition from CLECs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cand the other facts and market circumstances alleged [earlier]\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cin light of\xe2\x80\x9d these, the complaint concludes \xe2\x80\x9cthat [the ILECs] have entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry into their \xe2\x80\xa6 markets and have agreed not to compete with one another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb651, App. 27.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The nub of the complaint, then, is the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 parallel behavior, consisting of steps to keep the CLECs out and manifest disinterest in becoming CLECs themselves, and its sufficiency turns on the suggestions raised by this conduct when viewed in light of common economic experience.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think that nothing contained in the complaint invests either the action or inaction alleged with a plausible suggestion of conspiracy.  As to the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 supposed agreement to disobey the 1996 Act and thwart the CLECs\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to compete, we agree with the District Court that nothing in the complaint intimates that the resistance to the upstarts was anything more than the natural, unilateral reaction of each ILEC intent on keeping its regional dominance.  The 1996 Act did more than just subject the ILECs to competition; it obliged them to subsidize their competitors with their own equipment at wholesale rates.  The economic incentive to resist was powerful, but resisting competition is routine market conduct, and even if the ILECs flouted the 1996 Act in all the ways the plaintiffs allege, see <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb647, App. 23\xe2\x80\x9324, there is no reason to infer that the companies had agreed among themselves to do what was only natural anyway; so natural, in fact, that if alleging parallel decisions to resist competition were enough to imply an antitrust conspiracy, pleading a \xc2\xa71 violation against almost any group of competing businesses would be a sure thing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The complaint makes its closest pass at a predicate for conspiracy with the claim that collusion was necessary because success by even one CLEC in an ILEC\xe2\x80\x99s territory \xe2\x80\x9cwould have revealed the degree to which competitive entry by CLECs would have been successful in the other territories.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb650, App. 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  But, its logic aside, this general premise still fails to answer the point that there was just no need for joint encouragement to resist the 1996 Act; as the District Court said, \xe2\x80\x9ceach ILEC has reason to want to avoid dealing with CLECs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceach ILEC would attempt to keep CLECs out, regardless of the actions of the other ILECs.\xe2\x80\x9d  313 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 184; cf. <em>Kramer</em> v. <em>Pollock-Krasner Foundation</em>, 890 F.

Contrary to hope, the ILECs declined \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to enter each other\xe2\x80\x99s service territories in any significant way,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Complaint \xc2\xb638, App. 20, and the local telephone and high speed Internet market remains highly compartmentalized geographically, with minimal competition.  Based on this state of affairs, and perceiving the ILECs to be blessed with \xe2\x80\x9cespecially attractive business opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d in surrounding markets dominated by other ILECs, the plaintiffs assert that the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 parallel conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly suggestive of conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb640, App. 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it was not suggestive of conspiracy, not if history teaches anything.  In a traditionally unregulated industry with low barriers to entry, sparse competition among large firms dominating separate geographical segments of the market could very well signify illegal agreement, but here we have an obvious alternative explanation.  In the decade preceding the 1996 Act and well before that, monopoly was the norm in telecommunications, not the exception.  See <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/467/index.html">535 U. S. 467</a>, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (2002) (describing telephone service providers as traditional public monopolies).  The ILECs were born in that world, doubtless liked the world the way it was, and surely knew the adage about him who lives by the sword.  Hence, a natural explanation for the noncompetition alleged is that the former Government-sanctioned monopolists were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the complaint itself gives reasons to believe that the ILECs would see their best interests in keeping to their old turf.  Although the complaint says generally that the ILECs passed up \xe2\x80\x9cespecially attractive business opportunit[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d by declining to compete as CLECs against other ILECs, Complaint \xc2\xb640, App. 21, it does not allege that competition as CLECs was potentially any more lucrative than other opportunities being pursued by the ILECs during the same period,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and the complaint is replete with indications that any CLEC faced nearly insurmountable barriers to profitability owing to the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 flagrant resistance to the network sharing requirements of the 1996 Act, <em>id</em>., \xc2\xb647; App. 23\xe2\x80\x9326.  Not only that, but even without a monopolistic tradition and the peculiar difficulty of mandating shared networks, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]irms do not expand without limit and none of them enters every market that an outside observer might regard as profitable, or even a small portion of such markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb6307d, at 155 (Supp. 2006) (commenting on the case at bar).  The upshot is that Congress may have expected some ILECs to become CLECs in the legacy territories of other ILECs, but the disappointment does not make conspiracy plausible.  We agree with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that antitrust conspiracy was not suggested by the facts adduced under either theory of the complaint, which thus fails to state a valid \xc2\xa71 claim.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs say that our analysis runs counter to <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html">534 U.

But determining whether some illegal agreement may have taken place between unspecified persons at different ILECs (each a multibillion dollar corporation with legions of management level employees) at some point over seven years is a sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming undertaking not easily susceptible to the kind of line drawing and case management that the dissent envisions.  Perhaps the best answer to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s optimism that antitrust discovery is open to effective judicial control is a more extensive quotation of the authority just cited, a judge with a background in antitrust law.  Given the system that we have, the hope of effective judicial supervision is slim: \xe2\x80\x9cThe timing is all wrong.  The plaintiff files a sketchy complaint (the Rules of Civil Procedure discourage fulsome documents), and discovery is launched.  A judicial officer does not know the details of the case the parties will present and in theory <em>cannot</em> know the details.  Discovery is used to find the details.  The judicial officer always knows less than the parties, and the parties themselves may not know very well where they are going or what they expect to find.  A magistrate supervising discovery does not\xe2\x80\x94cannot\xe2\x80\x94know the expected productivity of a given request, because the nature of the requester\xe2\x80\x99s claim and the contents of the files (or head) of the adverse party are unknown.  Judicial officers cannot measure the costs and benefits to the requester and so cannot isolate impositional requests.  Requesters have no reason to disclose their own estimates because they gain from imposing costs on rivals (and may lose from an improvement in accuracy).  The portions of the Rules of Civil Procedure calling on judges to trim back excessive demands, therefore, have been, and are doomed to be, hollow.  We cannot prevent what we cannot detect; we cannot detect what we cannot define; we cannot define \xe2\x80\x98abusive\xe2\x80\x99 discovery except in theory, because in practice we lack essential information.\xe2\x80\x9d  Easterbrook, Discovery as Abuse, 69 B.

Whereas the model form alleges that the defendant struck the plaintiff with his car while plaintiff was crossing a particular highway at a specified date and time, the complaint here furnishes no clue as to which of the four ILECs (much less which of their employees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit agreement took place.  A defendant wishing to prepare an answer in the simple fact pattern laid out in Form 9 would know what to answer; a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 conclusory allegations in the \xc2\xa71 context would have little idea where to begin.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s quotations from the complaint leave the impression that plaintiffs directly allege illegal agreement; in fact, they proceed exclusively via allegations of parallel conduct, as both the District Court and Court of Appeals recognized.

The answer to that question has been settled for more than 50 years.  If that were indeed the issue, a summary reversal citing <em>Theatre Enterprises, Inc.</em> v. <em>Paramount Film Distributing Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/537/index.html">346 U.

If the defendants acted independently, their conduct was perfectly lawful.  If, however, that conduct is the product of a horizontal agreement among potential competitors, it was unlawful.  Plaintiffs have alleged such an agreement and, because the complaint was dismissed in advance of answer, the allegation has not even been denied.  Why, then, does the case not proceed?  Does a judicial opinion that the charge is not \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d provide a legally acceptable reason for dismissing the complaint?  I think not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 amended complaint describes a variety of circumstantial evidence and makes the straightforward allegation that petitioners</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9centered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective local telephone and/or high speed internet services markets and have agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Complaint in No. 02 CIV. 10220 (GEL) (SDNY) \xc2\xb651, App. 27 (hereinafter Complaint).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe complaint explains that, contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expectation when it enacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act, and consistent with their own economic self-interests, petitioner Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) have assiduously avoided infringing upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s markets and have refused to permit nonincumbent competitors to access their networks.  The complaint quotes Richard Notebaert, the former CEO of one such ILEC, as saying that competing in a neighboring ILEC\xe2\x80\x99s territory \xe2\x80\x9cmight be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb642, App. 22.  Moreover, respondents allege that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicate amongst themselves\xe2\x80\x9d through numerous industry associations.  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xb646, App. 23.  In sum, respondents allege that petitioners entered into an agreement that has long been recognized as a classic <em>per se</em> violation of the Sherman Act.  See Report of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 26 (1955).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under rules of procedure that have been well settled since well before our decision in <em>Theatre Enterprises</em>, a judge ruling on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss a complaint, \xe2\x80\x9cmust accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html">534 U.

But instead of requiring knowledgeable executives such as Notebaert to respond to these allegations by way of sworn depositions or other limited discovery\xe2\x80\x94and indeed without so much as requiring petitioners to file an answer denying that they entered into any agreement\xe2\x80\x94the majority permits immediate dismissal based on the assurances of company lawyers that nothing untoward was afoot.  The Court embraces the argument of those lawyers that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to infer that the companies had agreed among themselves to do what was only natural anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19; that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was just no need for joint encouragement to resist the 1996 Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20; and that the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural explanation for the noncompetition alleged is that the former Government-sanctioned monopolists were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court and petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 legal team are no doubt correct that the parallel conduct alleged is consistent with the absence of any contract, combination, or conspiracy.  But that conduct is also entirely consistent with the <em>presence</em> of the illegal agreement alleged in the complaint.  And the charge that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cagreed not to compete with one another\xe2\x80\x9d is not just one of \xe2\x80\x9ca few stray statements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18; it is an allegation describing unlawful conduct.  As such, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, our longstanding precedent, and sound practice mandate that the District Court at least require some sort of response from petitioners before dismissing the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two practical concerns presumably explain the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic departure from settled procedural law.  Private antitrust litigation can be enormously expensive, and there is a risk that jurors may mistakenly conclude that evidence of parallel conduct has proved that the parties acted pursuant to an agreement when they in fact merely made similar independent decisions.  Those concerns merit careful case management, including strict control of discovery, careful scrutiny of evidence at the summary judgment stage, and lucid instructions to juries; they do not, however, justify the dismissal of an adequately pleaded complaint without even requiring the defendants to file answers denying a charge that they in fact engaged in collective decisionmaking.  More importantly, they do not justify an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that seems to be driven by the majority\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of the plausibility of the ultimate factual allegation rather than its legal sufficiency.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules requires that a complaint contain \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  The rule did not come about by happenstance and its language is not inadvertent.  The English experience with Byzantine special pleading rules\xe2\x80\x94illustrated by the hypertechnical Hilary rules of 1834[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]\xe2\x80\x94made obvious the appeal of a pleading standard that was easy for the common litigant to understand and sufficed to put the defendant on notice as to the nature of the claim against him and the relief sought.  Stateside, David Dudley Field developed the highly influential New York Code of 1848, which required \xe2\x80\x9c[a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  An Act to Simplify and Abridge the Practice, Pleadings and Proceedings of the Courts of this State, ch. 379, \xc2\xa7120(2), 1848 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Laws pp. 497, 521.  Substantially similar language appeared in the Federal Equity Rules adopted in 1912.  See Fed. Equity Rule 25 (requiring \xe2\x80\x9ca short and simple statement of the ultimate facts upon which the plaintiff asks relief, omitting any mere statement of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A difficulty arose, however, in that the Field Code and its progeny required a plaintiff to plead \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cconclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d a distinction that proved far easier to say than to apply.  As commentators have noted,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cit is virtually impossible logically to distinguish among \xe2\x80\x98ultimate facts,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98evidence,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98conclusions.\xe2\x80\x99  Essentially any allegation in a pleading must be an assertion that certain occurrences took place.  The pleading spectrum, passing from evidence through ultimate facts to conclusions, is largely a continuum varying only in the degree of particularity with which the occurrences are described.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weinstein &amp; Distler, Comments on Procedural Reform: Drafting Pleading Rules, 57 Colum.

The merits of a claim would be sorted out during a flexible pretrial process and, as appropriate, through the crucible of trial.  See <em>Swierkiewicz</em>, 534 U. S., at 514 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a) is the starting point of a simplified pleading system, which was adopted to focus litigation on the merits of a claim\xe2\x80\x9d).

J. 976, 977 (1937) (hereinafter Clark, New Federal Rules).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe pleading paradigm under the new Federal Rules was well illustrated by the inclusion in the appendix of Form 9, a complaint for negligence.  As relevant, the Form 9 complaint states only: \xe2\x80\x9cOn June 1, 1936, in a public highway called Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts, defendant negligently drove a motor vehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing said highway.\xe2\x80\x9d  Form 9, Complaint for Negligence, Forms App., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 829 (hereinafter Form 9).  The complaint then describes the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injuries and demands judgment.  The asserted ground for relief\xe2\x80\x94namely, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s negligent driving\xe2\x80\x94would have been called a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conclusion of law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the code pleading of old.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Cook 419.

S. 41</a> (1957), must be understood.  The <em>Conley</em> plaintiffs were black railroad workers who alleged that their union local had refused to protect them against discriminatory discharges, in violation of the National Railway Labor Act.  The union sought to dismiss the complaint on the ground that its general allegations of discriminatory treatment by the defendants lacked sufficient specificity.  Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Black rejected the union\xe2\x80\x99s claim as foreclosed by the language of Rule 8.  <em>Id</em>., at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  In the course of doing so, he articulated the formulation the Court rejects today: \xe2\x80\x9cIn appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with the design of the Federal Rules, <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d formulation permits outright dismissal only when proceeding to discovery or beyond would be futile.  Once it is clear that a plaintiff has stated a claim that, if true, would entitle him to relief, matters of proof are appropriately relegated to other stages of the trial process.  Today, however, in its explanation of a decision to dismiss a complaint that it regards as a fishing expedition, the Court scraps <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d language.  Concluding that the phrase has been \xe2\x80\x9cquestioned, criticized, and explained away long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16, the Court dismisses it as careless composition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d language is to be interred, let it not be without a eulogy.  That exact language, which the majority says has \xe2\x80\x9cpuzzl[ed] the profession for 50 years,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>has been cited as authority in a dozen opinions of this Court and four separate writings.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In not one of those 16 opinions was the language \xe2\x80\x9cquestioned,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccriticized,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexplained away.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is the first by any Member of this Court to express <em>any</em> doubt as to the adequacy of the <em>Conley</em> formulation.  Taking their cues from the federal courts, 26 States and the District of Columbia utilize as their standard for dismissal of a complaint the very language the majority repudiates: whether it appears \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d in support of the claim would entitle the plaintiff to relief.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners have not requested that the <em>Conley</em> formulation be retired, nor have any of the six <em>amici</em> who filed briefs in support of petitioners.  I would not rewrite the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s civil procedure textbooks and call into doubt the pleading rules of most of its States without far more informed deliberation as to the costs of doing so.

This is not and cannot be what the <em>Conley</em> Court meant.  First, as I have explained, and as the <em>Conley</em> Court well knew, the pleading standard the Federal Rules meant to codify does not require, or even invite, the pleading of facts.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The \xe2\x80\x9cpleading standard\xe2\x80\x9d label the majority gives to what it reads into the <em>Conley</em> opinion\xe2\x80\x94a statement of the permissible factual support for an adequately pleaded complaint\xe2\x80\x94would not, therefore, have impressed the <em>Conley</em> Court itself.  Rather, that Court would have understood the majority\xe2\x80\x99s remodeling of its language to express an <em>evidentiary</em> standard, which the <em>Conley</em> Court had neither need nor want to explicate.  Second, it is pellucidly clear that the <em>Conley</em> Court was interested in what a complaint <em>must</em> contain, not what it <em>may</em> contain.  In fact, the Court said without qualification that it was \xe2\x80\x9cappraising the <em>sufficiency</em> of the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 U. S., at 45 (emphasis added).  It was, to paraphrase today\xe2\x80\x99s majority, describing \xe2\x80\x9cthe minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s survival,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can be triply sure as to <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s meaning by examining the three Court of Appeals cases the <em>Conley</em> Court cited as support for the \xe2\x80\x9caccepted rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 U. S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  In the first case, <em>Leimer</em> v. <em>State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Worcester, Mass.</em>, 108 F.\xc2\xa02d 302 (CA8 1940), the plaintiff alleged that she was the beneficiary of a life insurance plan and that the insurance company was wrongfully withholding proceeds from her.  In reversing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, the Eighth Circuit noted that court\xe2\x80\x99s own longstanding rule that, to warrant dismissal, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it should appear from the allegations that a cause of action does not exist, rather than that a cause of action has been defectively stated.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 305 (quoting <em>Winget</em> v. <em>Rockwood</em>, 69 F.\xc2\xa02d 326, 329 (CA8 1934)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Leimer</em> court viewed the Federal Rules\xe2\x80\x94specifically Rules 8(a)(2), 12(b)(6), 12(e) (motion for a more definite statement), and 56 (motion for summary judgment)\xe2\x80\x94as reinforcing the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no justification for dismissing a complaint for insufficiency of statement, except where it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  108 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 306.  The court refuted in the strongest terms any suggestion that the unlikelihood of recovery should determine the fate of a complaint: \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how improbable it may be that she can prove her claim, she is entitled to an opportunity to make the attempt, and is not required to accept as final a determination of her rights based upon inferences drawn in favor of the defendant from her amended complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit relied on <em>Leimer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s admonition in <em>Continental Collieries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Shober</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa02d 631 (1942), which the <em>Conley</em> Court also cited in support of its \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d formulation.  In a diversity action the plaintiff alleged breach of contract, but the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the contract appeared to be unenforceable under state law.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that there were facts in dispute that went to the enforceability of the contract, and that the rule at the pleading stage was as in <em>Leimer:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how likely it may seem that the pleader will be unable to prove his case, he is entitled, upon averring a claim, to an opportunity to try to prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d  130 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 635.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third case the <em>Conley</em> Court cited approvingly was written by Judge Clark himself.  In <em>Dioguardi</em> v. <em>Durning</em>, 139 F.\xc2\xa02d 774 (CA2 1944), the <em>pro se</em> plaintiff, an importer of \xe2\x80\x9ctonics,\xe2\x80\x9d charged the customs inspector with auctioning off the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s former merchandise for less than was bid for it\xe2\x80\x94and indeed for an amount equal to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own bid\xe2\x80\x94and complained that two cases of tonics went missing three weeks before the sale.  The inference, hinted at by the averments but never stated in so many words, was that the defendant fraudulently denied the plaintiff his rightful claim to the tonics, which, if true, would have violated federal law.  Writing six years after the adoption of the Federal Rules he held the lead rein in drafting, Judge Clark said that the defendant</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ccould have disclosed the facts from his point of view, in advance of a trial if he chose, by asking for a pre-trial hearing or by moving for a summary judgment with supporting affidavits.  But, as it stands, we do not see how the plaintiff may properly be deprived of his day in court to show what he obviously so firmly believes and what for present purposes defendant must be taken as admitting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 775.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs any civil procedure student knows, Judge Clark\xe2\x80\x99s opinion disquieted the defense bar and gave rise to a movement to revise Rule 8 to require a plaintiff to plead a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cause of action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See 5 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa71201, at 86\xe2\x80\x9387.  The movement failed, see <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Dioguardi</em> was explicitly approved in <em>Conley;</em> and \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n retrospect the case itself seems to be a routine application of principles that are universally accepted,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa71220, at 284\xe2\x80\x93285.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of <em>Leimer</em>, <em>Continental Collieries</em>, and <em>Dioguardi</em>, <em>Conley\xe2\x80\x99</em>s statement that a complaint is not to be dismissed unless \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d in support thereof would entitle the plaintiff to relief is hardly \xe2\x80\x9cpuzzling,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 16.  It reflects a philosophy that, unlike in the days of code pleading, separating the wheat from the chaff is a task assigned to the pretrial and trial process.  <em>Conley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language, in short, captures the policy choice embodied in the Federal Rules and binding on the federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have consistently reaffirmed that basic understanding of the Federal Rules in the half century since <em>Conley</em>.  For example, in <em>Scheuer</em> v. <em>Rhodes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/index.html"></a><a href="/us/416/232/index.html">416 U. S. 232</a> (1974), we reversed the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 dismissal on the pleadings when the respondents, the Governor and other officials of the State of Ohio, argued that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims were barred by sovereign immunity.  In a unanimous opinion by then-Justice Rehnquist, we emphasized that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a federal court reviews the sufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any evidence either by affidavit or admissions, its task is necessarily a limited one.  The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.  <em>Indeed it may appear on the face of the pleadings that a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 236 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe <em>Rhodes</em> plaintiffs had \xe2\x80\x9calleged generally and in conclusory terms\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendants, by calling out the National Guard to suppress the Kent State University student protests, \xe2\x80\x9cwere guilty of wanton, wilful and negligent conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Krause</em> v. <em>Rhodes</em>, 471 F.\xc2\xa02d 430, 433 (CA6 1972).  We reversed the Court of Appeals on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever the plaintiffs may or may not be able to establish as to the merits of their allegations, their claims, as stated in the complaints, given the favorable reading required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment because they were styled as suits against the defendants in their individual capacities.  416 U. S., at 238.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We again spoke with one voice against efforts to expand pleading requirements beyond their appointed limits in <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a> (1993).  Writing for the unanimous Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist rebuffed the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s effort to craft a standard for pleading municipal liability that accounted for \xe2\x80\x9cthe enormous expense involved today in litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d 1054, 1057 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted), by requiring a plaintiff to \xe2\x80\x9cstate with factual detail and particularity the basis for the claim which necessarily includes why the defendant-official cannot successfully maintain the defense of immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leatherman</em>, 507 U. S., at 167 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We found this language inconsistent with Rules 8(a)(2) and 9(b) and emphasized that motions to dismiss were not the place to combat discovery abuse: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the absence of [an amendment to Rule 9(b)], federal courts and litigants must rely on summary judgment and control of discovery to weed out unmeritorious claims sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 168\xe2\x80\x93169.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most recently, in <em>Swierkiewicz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html">534 U. S. 506</a>, we were faced with a case more similar to the present one than the majority will allow.  In discrimination cases, our precedents require a plaintiff at the summary judgment stage to produce either direct evidence of discrimination or, if the claim is based primarily on circumstantial evidence, to meet the shifting evidentiary burdens imposed under the framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/index.html">411 U. S. 792</a> (1973).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thurston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/111/index.html">469 U. S. 111</a>, 121 (1985).  Swierkiewicz alleged that he had been terminated on account of national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Second Circuit dismissed the suit on the pleadings because he had not pleaded a prima facie case of discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reversed in another unanimous opinion, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cunder a notice pleading system, it is not appropriate to require a plaintiff to plead facts establishing a prima facie case because the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> framework does not apply in every employment discrimination case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swierkiewicz</em>, 534 U. S., at 511.  We also observed that Rule 8(a)(2) does not contemplate a court\xe2\x80\x99s passing on the merits of a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s claim at the pleading stage.  Rather, the \xe2\x80\x9csimplified notice pleading standard\xe2\x80\x9d of the Federal Rules \xe2\x80\x9crelies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 512; see Brief for United States et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, O. T. 2001, No. 00\xe2\x80\x931853, p. 10 (stating that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not \xe2\x80\x9can appropriate device for testing the truth of what is asserted or for determining whether a plaintiff has any evidence to back up what is in the complaint\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in the discrimination context, we have developed an evidentiary framework for evaluating claims under \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act when those claims rest on entirely circumstantial evidence of conspiracy.  See <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/574/index.html">475 U. S. 574</a> (1986).  Under <em>Matsushita</em>, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of an illegal conspiracy may not, at the summary judgment stage, rest solely on the inferences that may be drawn from the parallel conduct of the defendants.  In order to survive a Rule 56 motion, a \xc2\xa71 plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cmust present evidence \xe2\x80\x98that tends to exclude the possibility\xe2\x80\x99 that the alleged conspirators acted independently.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 588 (quoting <em>Monsanto Co.</em> v. <em>Spray-Rite Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/752/index.html">465 U. S. 752</a>, 764 (1984)).  That is, the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cmust show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 588.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Everything today\xe2\x80\x99s majority says would therefore make perfect sense if it were ruling on a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment and the evidence included nothing more than the Court has described.  But it should go without saying in the wake of <em>Swierkiewicz</em> that a heightened production burden at the summary judgment stage does not translate into a heightened pleading burden at the complaint stage.  The majority rejects the complaint in this case because\xe2\x80\x94in light of the fact that the parallel conduct alleged is consistent with ordinary market behavior\xe2\x80\x94the claimed conspiracy is \xe2\x80\x9cconceivable\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cplausible,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 24.  I have my doubts about the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the plausibility of this alleged conspiracy.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.  But even if the majority\xe2\x80\x99s speculation is correct, its \xe2\x80\x9cplausibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard is irreconcilable with Rule 8 and with our governing precedents.  As we made clear in <em>Swierkiewicz</em> and <em>Leatherman</em>, fear of the burdens of litigation does not justify factual conclusions supported only by lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 arguments rather than sworn denials or admissible evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is a poor vehicle for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new pleading rule, for we have observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin antitrust cases, where \xe2\x80\x98the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hospital Building Co.</em> v. <em>Trustees of Rex Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/738/index.html"></a><a href="/us/425/738/index.html">425 U. S. 738</a>, 746 (1976) (quoting <em>Poller</em> v. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/464/index.html">368 U. S. 464</a>, 473 (1962)); see also <em>Knuth</em> v. <em>Erie-Crawford Dairy Cooperative Assn.</em>, 395 F.\xc2\xa02d 420, 423 (CA3 1968) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98liberal\xe2\x80\x99 approach to the consideration of antitrust complaints is important because inherent in such an action is the fact that all the details and specific facts relied upon cannot properly be set forth as part of the pleadings\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the fact that the Sherman Act authorizes the recovery of treble damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for successful plaintiffs indicates that Congress intended to encourage, rather than discourage, private enforcement of the law.  See <em>Radovich</em> v. <em>National Football League</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/445/index.html">352 U. S. 445</a>, 454 (1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress itself has placed the private antitrust litigant in a most favorable position \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. In the face of such a policy this Court should not add requirements to burden the private litigant beyond what is specifically set forth by Congress in those laws\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is therefore more, not less, important in antitrust cases to resist the urge to engage in armchair economics at the pleading stage.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same year we decided <em>Conley</em>, Judge Clark wrote, presciently,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI fear that every age must learn its lesson that special pleading cannot be made to do the service of trial and that live issues between active litigants are not to be disposed of or evaded on the paper pleadings, i.e., the formalistic claims of the parties.

Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Carpenters</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/index.html"></a><a href="/us/459/519/index.html">459 U. S. 519</a>, 526\xe2\x80\x93527 (1983).  Nor does the Court hold that these plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury entitling them to sue for damages under those laws, see <em>Brunswick Corp.</em> v. <em>Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/477/index.html">429 U. S. 477</a>, 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (1977).  Rather, the theory on which the Court permits dismissal is that, so far as the Federal Rules are concerned, no agreement has been alleged at all.  This is a mind-boggling conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, prior to the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 the law prohibited the defendants from competing with each other.  The new statute was enacted to replace a monopolistic market with a competitive one.  The Act did not merely require the regional monopolists to take affirmative steps to facilitate entry to new competitors, see <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/398/index.html">540 U. S. 398</a>, 402 (2004); it also permitted the existing firms to compete with each other and to expand their operations into previously forbidden territory.  See 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271.  Each of the defendants decided not to take the latter step.  That was obviously an extremely important business decision, and I am willing to presume that each company acted entirely independently in reaching that decision.  I am even willing to entertain the majority\xe2\x80\x99s belief that any agreement among the companies was unlikely.  But the plaintiffs allege in three places in their complaint, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 4, 51, 64, App. 11, 27, 30, that the ILECs did in fact agree both to prevent competitors from entering into their local markets and to forgo competition with each other.  And as the Court recognizes, at the motion to dismiss stage, a judge assumes \xe2\x80\x9cthat all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority circumvents this obvious obstacle to dismissal by pretending that it does not exist.  The Court admits that \xe2\x80\x9cin form a few stray statements in the complaint speak directly of agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d but disregards those allegations by saying that \xe2\x80\x9con fair reading these are merely legal conclusions resting on the prior allegations\xe2\x80\x9d of parallel conduct.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s dichotomy between factual allegations and \xe2\x80\x9clegal conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d is the stuff of a bygone era, <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  That distinction was a defining feature of code pleading, see generally Clark, The Complaint in Code Pleading, 35 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 259 (1925\xe2\x80\x931926), but was conspicuously abolished when the Federal Rules were enacted in 1938.

Smith, An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, in 39 Great Books of the Western World 55 (R. Hutchins &amp; M. Adler eds. 1952).  I am not so cynical as to accept that sentiment at face value, but I need not do so here.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint points not only to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 numerous opportunities to meet with each other, Complaint \xc2\xb646, App. 23,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] but also to Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s curious statement that encroaching on a fellow incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s territory \xe2\x80\x9cmight be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it right,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb642, App. 22.  What did he mean by that?  One possible (indeed plausible) inference is that he meant that while it would be in his company\xe2\x80\x99s economic self-interest to compete with its brethren, he had agreed with his competitors not to do so.  According to the complaint, that is how the Illinois Coalition for Competitive Telecom construed Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s statement, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb644, App. 22 (calling the statement \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of potential collusion among regional Bell phone monopolies to not compete against one another and kill off potential competitors in local phone service\xe2\x80\x9d), and that is how Members of Congress construed his company\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb645, App. 23 (describing a letter to the Justice Department requesting an investigation into the possibility that the ILECs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cvery apparent non-competition policy\xe2\x80\x9d was coordinated).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps Notebaert meant instead that competition would be sensible in the short term but not in the long run.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what his lawyers tell us anyway.  See Brief for Petitioners 36.  But I would think that no one would know better what Notebaert meant than Notebaert himself.  Instead of permitting respondents to ask Notebaert, however, the Court looks to other quotes from that and other articles and decides that what he meant was that entering new markets as a CLEC would not be a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sustainable economic model.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa013.  Never mind that\xe2\x80\x94as anyone ever interviewed knows\xe2\x80\x94a newspaper article is hardly a verbatim transcript; the writer selects quotes to package his story, not to record a subject\xe2\x80\x99s views for posterity.  But more importantly the District Court was required at this stage of the proceedings to construe Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous statement in the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 favor.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  See <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U. S. 737</a>, 768, n.\xc2\xa01 (1984).  The inference the statement supports\xe2\x80\x94that simultaneous decisions by ILECs not even to attempt to poach customers from one another once the law authorized them to do so were the product of an agreement\xe2\x80\x94sits comfortably within the realm of possibility.  That is all the Rules require.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be clear, if I had been the trial judge in this case, I would not have permitted the plaintiffs to engage in massive discovery based solely on the allegations in this complaint.  On the other hand, I surely would not have dismissed the complaint without requiring the defendants to answer the charge that they \xe2\x80\x9chave agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]<em> </em>\xc2\xb651, App. 27.  Even a sworn denial of that charge would not justify a summary dismissal without giving the plaintiffs the opportunity to take depositions from Notebaert and at least one responsible executive representing each of the other defendants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents in this case proposed a plan of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98phased discovery\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d limited to the existence of the alleged conspiracy and class certification.  Brief for Respondents 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  Two petitioners rejected the plan.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Whether or not respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed plan was sensible, it was an appropriate subject for negotiation.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Given the charge in the complaint\xe2\x80\x94buttressed by the common sense of Adam Smith\xe2\x80\x94I cannot say that the possibility that joint discussions and perhaps some agreements played a role in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 decisionmaking process is so implausible that dismissing the complaint before any defendant has denied the charge is preferable to granting respondents even a minimal opportunity to prove their claims.  See Clark, New Federal Rules 977 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hrough the weapons of discovery and summary judgment we have developed new devices, with more appropriate penalties to aid in matters of <em>proof</em>, and do not need to force the pleadings to their less appropriate function\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I fear that the unfortunate result of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s new pleading rule will be to invite lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 debates over economic theory to conclusively resolve antitrust suits in the absence of any evidence.  It is no surprise that the antitrust defense bar\xe2\x80\x94among whom \xe2\x80\x9clament\xe2\x80\x9d as to inadequate judicial supervision of discovery is most \xe2\x80\x9ccommon,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x94should lobby for this state of affairs.  But \xe2\x80\x9cwe must recall that their primary responsibility is to win cases for their clients, not to improve law administration for the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clark, Special Pleading in the Big Case 152.  As we did in our prior decisions, we should have instructed them that their remedy was to seek to amend the Federal Rules\xe2\x80\x94not our interpretation of them.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  See <em>Swierkiewicz</em>, 534 U.

No. 89</em> v. <em>Department of Education</em>, 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  I happen to believe that there are cases in which other tools of construction are more reliable than text, but I agree of course that congressional intent should guide us in matters of statutory interpretation.  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (Stevens, J., concurring).  This is a case in which the intentions of the drafters of three important sources of law\xe2\x80\x94the Sherman Act, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\xe2\x80\x94all point unmistakably in the same direction, yet the Court marches resolutely the other way.  Whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions will benefit only defendants in antitrust treble-damages cases, or whether its test for the sufficiency of a complaint will inure to the benefit of all civil defendants, is a question that the future will answer.  But that the Court has announced a significant new rule that does not even purport to respond to any congressional command is glaringly obvious.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The transparent policy concern that drives the decision is the interest in protecting antitrust defendants\xe2\x80\x94who in this case are some of the wealthiest corporations in our economy\xe2\x80\x94from the burdens of pretrial discovery.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.

For in the final analysis it is only a lack of confidence in the ability of trial judges to control discovery, buttressed by appellate judges\xe2\x80\x99 independent appraisal of the plausibility of profoundly serious factual allegations, that could account for this stark break from precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the allegation of conspiracy happens to be true, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision obstructs the congressional policy favoring competition that undergirds both the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Sherman Act itself.  More importantly, even if there is abundant evidence that the allegation is untrue, directing that the case be dismissed without even looking at any of that evidence marks a fundamental\xe2\x80\x94and unjustified\xe2\x80\x94change in the character of pretrial practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See 9 W.

The remedy for an allegation lacking sufficient specificity to provide adequate notice is, of course, a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement.  See <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/506/index.html">534 U.

Thus, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or persons involved in the alleged conspiracies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa010, is, for our purposes, academic.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court describes my reference to the allegation that the defendants belong to various trade associations as \xe2\x80\x9cplayfully\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that the defendants conspired to restrain trade.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa012.  Quite the contrary: an allegation that competitors meet on a regular basis, like the allegations of parallel conduct, is consistent with\xe2\x80\x94though not sufficient to prove\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 entirely serious and unequivocal allegation that the defendants entered into an unlawful agreement.  Indeed, if it were true that the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9crest their \xc2\xa71 claim on descriptions of parallel conduct and not on any independent allegation of actual agreement among the ILECs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, there would have been no purpose in including a reference to the trade association meetings in the amended complaint.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is ironic that the Court seeks to justify its decision to draw factual inferences in the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 favor at the pleading stage by citing to a rule of evidence, <em>ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa013.  Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), a judicially noticed fact \xe2\x80\x9cmust be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether Notebaert\xe2\x80\x99s statements constitute evidence of a conspiracy is hardly beyond reasonable dispute.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court worries that a defendant seeking to respond to this \xe2\x80\x9cconclusory\xe2\x80\x9d allegation \xe2\x80\x9cwould have little idea where to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19, n.\xc2\xa010.

The Court vastly underestimates a district court\xe2\x80\x99s case-management arsenal.  Before discovery even begins, the court may grant a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 12(e) motion; Rule 7(a) permits a trial court to order a plaintiff to reply to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s answer, see <em>Crawford-El</em> v. <em>Britton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/574/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/574/index.html">523 U. S. 574</a>, 598 (1998); and Rule 23 requires \xe2\x80\x9crigorous analysis\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that class certification is appropriate, <em>General Telephone Co. of Southwest</em> v. <em>Falcon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/147/index.html">457 U. S. 147</a>, 160 (1982); see <em>In\xc2\xa0re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation</em>, 471 F.\xc2\xa03d 24 (CA2 2006) (holding that a district court may not certify a class without ruling that each Rule 23 requirement is met, even if a requirement overlaps with a merits issue).  Rule 16 invests a trial judge with the power, backed by sanctions, to regulate pretrial proceedings via conferences and scheduling orders, at which the parties may discuss, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe elimination of frivolous claims or defenses,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 16(c)(1); \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 16(c)(2); \xe2\x80\x9cthe control and scheduling of discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 16(c)(6); and \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 16(c)(12).  Subsequently, Rule 26 confers broad discretion to control the combination of interrogatories, requests for admissions, production requests, and depositions permitted in a given case; the sequence in which such discovery devices may be deployed; and the limitations imposed upon them.  See 523 U. S., at 598\xe2\x80\x93599.  Indeed, Rule 26(c) specifically permits a court to take actions \xe2\x80\x9cto protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense\xe2\x80\x9d by, for example, disallowing a particular discovery request, setting appropriate terms and conditions, or limiting its scope.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the Federal Rules contemplate that pretrial matters will be settled through a flexible process of give and take, of proffers, stipulations, and stonewalls, not by having trial judges screen allegations for their plausibility <em>vel non</em> without requiring an answer from the defendant.  See <em>Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A.</em> v. <em>Rogers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/197/index.html">357 U. S. 197</a>, 206 (1958) (\xe2\x80\x9cRule 34 is sufficiently flexible to be adapted to the exigencies of particular litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  And should it become apparent over the course of litigation that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s filings bespeak an <em>in terrorem</em> suit, the district court has at its call its own <em>in terrorem</em> device, in the form of a wide array of Rule 11 sanctions.  See Rules 11(b), (c) (authorizing sanctions if a suit is presented \xe2\x80\x9cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); see <em>Business Guides, Inc.</em> v. <em>Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/533/index.html">498 U.

The change could not be accomplished without abandoning notice pleading, increasing the number of judicial officers, and giving them more authority \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. If we are to rule out judge-directed discovery, however, we must be prepared to pay the piper.
