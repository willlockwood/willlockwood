We have concluded we do not have to consider that point. The "affecting commerce" test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of Congress\' power over purely <i>intra</i>state commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects. See, <i>e. g., Wickard </i>v. <i>Filburn, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/case.html">317 U. S. 111</a> (1942). The proof at Robertson\'s trial, however, focused largely on the interstate activities of Robertson\'s mine. For example, the Government proved that Robertson purchased at least $100,000 worth of equipment and supplies for use in the mine. Contrary to the Court of Appeals\' suggestion, all of those items were not purchased locally ("drawn generally from the stream of interstate commerce," 15 F. 3d, at 869 (internal quotation marks omitted)); the Government proved that some of them were purchased in California and transported to Alaska for use in the mine\'s operations. Cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>American Building Maintenance Industries, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/271/case.html">422 U. S. 271</a>, 285 (1975) (allegation that company had made <i>local </i>purchases of equipment and supplies that were merely <i>manufactured </i>out of state was insufficient to show that company was "engaged in commerce" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 7 of the Clayton Act). The Government also proved that, on more than one occasion, Robertson sought workers from out of state and brought them to Alaska to work in the mine. Cf. <i>id., </i>at 274. Furthermore, Robertson, the mine\'s sole proprietor, took $30,000 worth of gold, or 15% of the mine\'s total output, with him out of the State.</p><p>Whether or not these activities met (and whether or not, to bring the gold mine within the "affecting commerce" provision of RICO, they would <i>have </i>to meet) the requirement of substantially affecting interstate commerce, they assuredly</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="672">672</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>brought the gold mine within \xc2\xa7 1962(a)\'s alternative criterion of "any enterprise ... engaged in ... interstate or foreign commerce." As we said in <i>American Building Maintenance, </i>a corporation is generally "engaged \'in commerce\'" when it is itself "directly engaged in the production, distribution, or acquisition of goods or services in interstate commerce." <i>Id., </i>at 283. See also <i>Gulf Oil Corp. </i>v. <i>Copp Paving Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/186/case.html">419 U. S. 186</a>, 195 (1974).</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p><p>Reversed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
