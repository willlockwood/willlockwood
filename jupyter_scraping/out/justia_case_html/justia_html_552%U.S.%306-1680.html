ALLEN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS <em>v.</em> DANIEL\nSIEBERT</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931680.\xe2\x80\x83Decided November 5, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Daniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman.  Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990.  This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990.  <em>Siebert</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/963/index.html">498 U. S. 963</a>.  On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court.  The state courts denied the petition as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000\xe2\x80\x932001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.*<footcall num="*">  The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000.  Siebert did not seek review in this Court.  On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  The limitations period is tolled, however, while \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Because Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  See <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U. S. 214</a>, 217 (2002).  Thus, absent tolling, Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court dismissed Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state postconviction relief is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds.  The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction petition was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it.  See <em>Siebert</em> v. <em>Campbell</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 1018, 1030 (CA11 2003) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U. S. 408</a> (2005).  In <em>Pace</em>, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  <em>Id.</em>, at 414, 417.  Relying on <em>Pace</em>, the District Court again found that Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction petition was not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely.  The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded.  In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <em>Pace</em> on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em>, \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] as an affirmative defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  480 F.\xc2\xa03d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007).  Thus, the court found its prior holding\xe2\x80\x94that Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction petition was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional ground\xe2\x80\x94stood as the law of the case.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Pace</em>.  Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em> happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, 556 Pa. 1, 5\xe2\x80\x936, 726 A.\xc2\xa02d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision.  Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a> (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98filing\xe2\x80\x99 conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d which are not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\xe2\x80\x9d which are.  <em>Pace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 417 (citing <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311).  We found that statutes of limitations are \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d conditions because they \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the very initiation of a petition and a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider that petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pace</em>, 544 U. S., at 417.  Thus, we held \xe2\x80\x9cthat time limits, <em>no matter their form</em>, are \xe2\x80\x98filing\xe2\x80\x99 conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d and that a state postconviction petition is therefore not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d if it was rejected by the state court as untimely.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, our holding in <em>Pace</em> turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish \xe2\x80\x9cconditions to filing\xe2\x80\x9d a petition for state postconviction relief.  Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x94it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition.  The fact that Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one.  Indeed, in <em>Pace</em> we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See 544 U. S., at 417, n.\xc2\xa07 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004\xe2\x80\x932005)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Excluding from <em>Pace</em>\xe2\x80\x99s scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <em>Kirkland</em> v. <em>State</em>, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P.\xc2\xa03d 819, 821 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.  It \xe2\x80\x98is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Cole</em> v. <em>State</em>, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P.\xc2\xa03d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <em>People</em> v. <em>Boclair</em>, 202 Ill.\xc2\xa02d 89, 101, 789 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is \xe2\x80\x9can affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\xe2\x80\x9d).  What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <em>Ex parte Ward</em>, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Our decision in <em>Pace</em> precludes such an approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore reiterate now what we held in <em>Pace</em>: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, \xe2\x80\x98that [is] the end of the matter\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 414 (quoting <em>Carey</em>, 536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original).  Because Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0At the time Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall not entertain any petition,\xe2\x80\x9d with certain exceptions not applicable here, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the petition is filed \xe2\x80\xa6 within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged.

The time limit under consideration in <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U. S. 408</a> (2005), was of the former kind\xe2\x80\x94as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion expressly noted.

The time limit at issue in this case is of the latter, distinguishable kind\xe2\x80\x94as the Court of Appeals correctly stated.  480 F.\xc2\xa03d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007) (holding that <em>Pace</em> did not address statutory tolling for \xe2\x80\x9ca statute of limitations that operated as an affirmative defense\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that there is language in the majority opinion in <em>Pace </em>that is broad enough to cover both kinds of limitations provisions, but only the former (those that do not operate as affirmative defenses) can even arguably provide a reasonable basis for concluding that an untimely petition has not been \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214 (AEDPA).*<footcall num="*">  I therefore respectfully dissent.</footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0I continue to believe, as stated in my dissent in <em>Pace</em>, 544 U.
