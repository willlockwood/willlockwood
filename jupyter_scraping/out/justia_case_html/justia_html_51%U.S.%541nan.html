S. 6</a></span> How. 81.  It was afterwards reinstated on the docket of this Court by Act of Congress approved 20 July, 1848.</p>\n<p>The appellants, who were the petitioners in the court below, on 28 May, 1829, filed their petition in the Superior court for the Eastern District of Florida under the Act of Congress dated 28 May, 1828, which gave authority to that court to adjudicate claims to land embraced by the Treaty of 22 February, 1819, between the United States and Spain.</p>\n<p>The petition set forth, that, on 29 October, 1817, a grant for 16,000 acres of land was made by the Spanish governor, Coppinger, to Jose Argote Villalobos, for the purpose of erecting thereon a water saw mill; that the location thereof was to be on Trout Creek, in the Province of East Florida, but not being able to find an eligible situation for said mill and a sufficient quantity of land ungranted on Trout Creek, the Surveyor General, George J. F. Clarke, in virtue of the power with which he was invested by the Spanish government, located and surveyed 6,000 acres of said grant on Black Creek, within the same district; also 6,000 acres on Indian River, and the remaining 4000 acres in Alachua. The petition further sets forth, that one moiety of the two tracts of 6,000 acres was, on 14 March, 1821, conveyed to the Marquis de Fougeres, one of the petitioners, and that a water saw mill was built by the petitioners on the tract located on Black Creek; that the said claim for the two tracts of land was presented to the Board of Land commissioners for East Florida, who reported unfavorably to the petitioners on 12 December, 1827, though not on the ground that said grant was either antedated or forged.</p>\n<p>The attorney for the United States, without admitting any of the facts stated in the petition, and calling for proof thereof, averred in his answer to the petition that if any such grant had been made by the Spanish authorities during the administration of Governor Coppinger, it was made contrary to the laws, ordinances, and royal regulations of the government of Spain, then in force in said Province of East Florida, and that it was never approved by the King of Spain.  That no power was ever conferred on said Governor Coppinger to make grants of the magnitude and description of the one set forth in the petition.  That if said grant were otherwise valid, it gave no right to locate on other lands than those at Trout Creek.  That the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 51 U. S. 543</a></p><p> tract on Indian River was more than one hundred miles distant from Black Creek, where the mill, if built at all, was erected, and that neither of said tracts was vacant land, but they were in possession of the Seminole Indians.  That at the time of the alleged grant, Villalobos was a Spaniard, and under the laws of Spain could not locate said lands in prejudice of the rights of the Indians.  That said grant, if made at all, was made since 24 January, 1818, and is void by the eighth article of the treaty.  That the sale to the Marquis de Fougeres was void, and that the petitioners have forfeited all right to said land, if any they had, by failure to improve and cultivate or perform the conditions of said grant.</p>\n<p>There was subsequently an amended answer, setting forth certain reports made by the "Senor Auditor of War," relative to grants and concessions of land made upon condition of the establishment of factories, saw mills &amp;c., which had not been complied with, and recommending the term of six months from that date as the time limited for the performance of such condition; and that grants upon condition unperformed after that time should be null and void.  Which report was averred to have been confirmed by governor Coppinger.  And it was averred that the petitioners had not brought themselves within such limit.</p>\n<p>There was a general replication.</p>\n<p>The memorial and decree were as follows:</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Memorial</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"Senor governor:  Don Jose Argote Villalobos, with great respect, presents himself to your Excellency and says that he has fixed his intentions to establish a mill for sawing timber on a creek of the River St. John\'s named Trout Creek, which affords a site fit for the purpose, and as such an undertaking promises great advantages to the royal revenue in the exportation of this product of the province, and also the supply of the timber necessary for the inhabitants, he supplicates your Excellency to be pleased to grant him your superior permission that he may accomplish the said mill, with a corresponding right to five square miles of land, or an equivalent for a competent supply of timber, a favor which he hopes to obtain from the goodness of your Excellency."</p>\n<p>"JOSE ARGOTE VILLALOBOS"</p>\n<p>"<em>River St. Mary\'s, 27th October, 1817</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Decree</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"St. Augustine of Florida, 29 October, 1817"</p>\n<p>"Taking into consideration the benefit and utility which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 51 U.

It is likewise agreed that the parties will give to each other notice of their intention to sell, each of them having in themselves, or in their attorneys, the same right and privilege which has been specified in regard to the Indian River tract.  And the said Marquis, in consideration of the said sale and transfer made by said Jose, obligates himself to construct and erect, at his own charge and expense, on the said Black Creek, all its necessary machinery, dams and houses which ought to be built in such a manner that the conditions of the grant be fulfilled, and for the intent and purpose of this agreement, the works for the said mill shall have to be commenced on or before the 20th day of next April, the Marquis supplying all the means and funds necessary to obtain its perfection, in order that it may be in operation and in activity as soon as possible.

It was in proof that Black Creek was some thirty miles from Trout Creek, and still further about one hundred miles from Black Creek, and still further from Trout Creek, and the survey in Alachua still more remote.</p>\n<p>The court decreed that the claim of the petitioners was not valid, and that it be rejected, from which decree this appeal was taken. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 51 U. S. 554</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In October, 1817, Coppinger, Governor of Florida, was applied to by Villalobos for leave to build a saw mill on Trout Creek, at a proper site for a mill there existing, with a corresponding right to five miles square of land, or an equivalent, for a competent supply of timber, on which application the governor decreed as follows:</p>\n<p>"Taking into consideration the benefit and utility which would result to the Province in its improvement if what Don Jose Argote Villalobos proposes should be accomplished, it is granted to him, without prejudice to a third person, that he may build a water saw mill on the creek of the River St. John\'s, named Trout Creek, and also to make use of the pine trees which are comprehended in a square of five miles, which is granted to him, which advantages he shall enjoy for the said water saw mill, without any other person having the right to diminish it in any respect.  And for his security, let the corresponding certificate be dispatched to him from the secretary\'s office."</p>\n<p>1. No mill was built on Trout Creek, nor any attempt made to do so, but sixteen thousand acres of land were surveyed for Villalobos by some deputy surveyor of the Surveyor General, George F. Clarke, and certified by the latter, in three separate parcels; one on Black Creek, for six thousand acres; one on Indian River, for six thousand acres; and the third in Alachua, for four thousand acres.  The nearest of said surveys to Trout Creek is about thirty miles off, and the farthest is more than one hundred miles distant.  The lands as surveyed are claimed by Villalobos and the Marquis de Fougeres, to whom Villalobos conveyed a moiety of his claim in March, 1821.  This latter survey lies within territory then held by the Seminole Indians.  A mill was built by the Marquis on Black Creek, on the survey there made for six thousand acres, say in 1822 and 1823.  Whether the surveys were regularly returned to the office of the public archives or to the government secretary\'s office does not appear; there is no evidence that they were returned to either by the Surveyor General, the proof being that they were filed in the office of the public archives as part of the evidences of claims that had been submitted to the register and receiver when acting as commissioners on Florida claims. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 51 U. S. 555</a></p><p></p>\n<p>One thing, however, is certain -- that the change of location never received any direct sanction from the governor of the Spanish province during the time his powers existed to act in the matter.  On this state of facts, the question is whether the Surveyor General had any authority to make the change, and thereby bind the Spanish government to complete the title; if he had such power, then the American government is equally bound.</p>\n<p>By the eighth article of the treaty of 1819, it is stipulated, that</p>\n<p>"All grants of land made before 24 January, 1818, by his Catholic Majesty, or by his lawful authorities shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands to the same extent that the same would be valid if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty."</p>\n<p>This Court has uniformly held that where the land was granted by a concession, and a survey had been made of it by the Surveyor General, in reasonable conformity to the grant, before 24 January, 1818, that such survey should be recognized as valid and deemed to have severed the land from the public domain.</p>\n<p>That the surveys made for Villalobos were not in reasonable conformity to the grant made for 16,000 acres on Trout Creek is not assumed on part of the claimants; they rest their right to a confirmation for the three tracts surveyed on the ground, that the Surveyor General had power, by force of the grant, to change the location, and to locate the land granted in as many parcels as he saw proper to designate.  To show the existence of this power in the Surveyor General, he was examined as a witness in the present controversy, and proved that he had, in various instances, made similar changes, and that none of them had been rejected or objected to by the Spanish governors.  Antonio Alvarez, the keeper of the archives, was also examined on this point; he testified that there exist in the archives a few instances where changes of location had been made by the Surveyor General without an order of the governor for the change, but this was done under peculiar circumstances, as where the land granted had been taken by a previous concession.</p>\n<p>From the long experience this Court has had in the investigation of Spanish titles as claimed in Florida, as well as from the practice in regard to which the witnesses depose, we are of opinion, that the Surveyor General had no authority to change the location of the grant and to split up the surveys, as was done in this instance.  The question has been settled by this Court in the cases of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/171/case.html">United States v. Huertas,</a></span></em> 9 Pet. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 51 U. S. 556</a></p><p> 171 and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/81/case.html#83">United States v. Levy,</a></span></em> 13 Pet. 83.  The surveys in this instance abandoned the grant; no aid is asked from it, but the sole act of the Surveyor General is relied on for a decree completing the title, and if confirmed by us, must be sanctioned as the origin of Villalobos\' title, and that no such power can be exercised by this Court was held in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/40/167/case.html#172">The Case of Forbes,</a></span></em> 15 Pet. 172.</p>\n<p>The grant was for a tract comprehended in a square of five miles, and although an equivalent was solicited, none was granted except in case vacant land enough could not be found at Trout Creek to satisfy the grant in one body, and a square form, nor is there any evidence that such deficiency existed.</p>\n<p>It is proved that the lands on Trout Creek are poor and of little or no value, and that those surveyed are of the best quality known in Florida; and manifestly that the change of survey had in view the acquisition of valuable lands for the purposes of speculation, and not to secure pine trees out of which to saw lumber, so that these surveys have neither merit in fact nor the sanction of law to uphold them.</p>\n<p>2. As the want of a survey does not defeat the grant, as this Court held in the cases of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/133/case.html">Arredondo,</a></span></em> 13 Pet. 133, and of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/40/215/case.html#224">Buyck,</a></span></em> 15 Pet. 224, the next and remaining question is whether the grant itself can be located.  For although the petition proceeds on the surveys, yet this Court having the case before it as on bill in chancery, we would be disinclined to bar the claim on a technical ground.  If it had merits, and these could not be reached on the pleadings as they stand, the Court on hearing could order amendments so that the merits could be reached, and to this end the cause could be remanded to the court below; nor do we apprehend even this to be necessary in a case like the present.</p>\n<p>The surveys being rejected, the grant may be resorted to and a survey ordered if the land granted can be identified.  It is therefore necessary to examine the claim on the face of the grant.  For a description of the place where the land was solicited and which is adopted by the governor\'s decree, we must look to the memorial of Villalobos.  He says</p>\n<p>"that he has fixed his intentions to establish a mill for sawing timber, on a creek of the River St. John\'s named Trout Creek, which affords a site fit for the purpose,"</p>\n<p>and he supplicates the governor to grant permission to build the mill at that place, with a corresponding right to five miles square of land for a competent supply of timber.</p>\n<p>The grant refers to no one part of Trout Creek more than another, at which the site for the mill is and where the land </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 51 U. S. 557</a></p><p> should be surveyed; there is no identity of place, nor a possibility to locate the grant by survey.  No claim has ever been before this Court that is more vague.</p>\n<p>In cases of a vague description, this Court has uniformly held that no particular land was severed from the public domain by the grant and that no survey could be ordered by the courts of justice.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/40/215/case.html#224">Buyck v.
