S. 504</a></p><p> <em>Lehman v. Lycoming County Children\'s Services,</em> 439 U.S. 880 (1978), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision terminating the parental rights of petitioner Marjorie Lehman with respect to three sons born in 1963, 1965, and 1969. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1971, Ms. Lehman discovered that she was pregnant again.  Because of housing and other problems related to the care of her sons, Ms. Lehman voluntarily placed them in the legal custody of the Lycoming County Children\'s Services Agency, and it placed them in foster homes.</p>\n<p>Although Ms. Lehman visited her sons monthly, she did not request their return until 1974.  At that point, the Lycoming County Children\'s Services Agency initiated parental termination proceedings.  In those proceedings, the Orphan\'s Court Division of the Lycoming County Court of Common Pleas heard testimony from Agency caseworkers, a psychologist, nutrition aides, petitioner, and the three sons. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The judge concluded:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is absolutely clear to the court that, by reason of her very limited social and intellectual development, combined with her five-year separation from the children, the mother is incapable of providing minimal care, control and supervision for the three children.  Her incapacity cannot and will not be remedied. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>In re Lehman,</em> Nos. 2986, 2987, and 2988, p. 4 (Ct.Common Pleas, Lycoming County, Pa., June 3, 1976). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court therefore </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 458 U. S. 505</a></p><p> declared that petitioner\'s parental rights respecting the three sons were terminated.</p>\n<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the termination order based on "parental incapacity, which does not involve parental misconduct."  <em>In re William L., supra,</em> at 331, 383 A.2d at 1232.  It held that the legislature\'s power to protect the physical and emotional needs of children authorized termination in the absence of serious harm or risk of serious harm to the children and in the absence of parental misconduct.  The court stressed that, "[i]n the instant cases, the basis for termination is several years of demonstrated parental incapacity. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  It also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague either on its face or as applied.</p>\n<p>Petitioner sought this Court\'s review in a petition for certiorari, rather than by appeal. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We denied the petition.  <em>Lehman v. Lycoming County Children\'s Services,</em> 439 U.S. 880 (1978).  Petitioner then filed the instant proceeding on January 16, 1979, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, seeking a writ of habeas corpus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 458 U. S. 506</a></p><p> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2241 and 2254.  Petitioner requested (i) a declaration of the invalidity of the Pennsylvania statute under which her parental rights were terminated; (ii) a declaration that petitioner was the legal parent of the children; and (iii) an order releasing the children to her custody unless, within 60 days, an appropriate state court judicially determined that the best interest of the children required that temporary custody remain with the State.</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the petition without a hearing.  Relying primarily on <em>Sylvander v. New England Home for Little Wanderers,</em> 584 F.2d 1103 (CA1 1978), the court concluded that</p>\n<p>"the custody maintained by the Respondent over the three Lehman children is not that type of custody to which the federal habeas corpus remedy may be addressed."</p>\n<p><em>Lehman v. Lycoming County Children\'s Services Agency,</em> Civ. No. 79-65 (MD Pa.1979), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, 147a.</p>\n<p>Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s order of dismissal by a divided vote of six to four.  648 F.2d 135 (1981).  No majority opinion was written.  A plurality of four, in an opinion written by Judge Garth, concluded that</p>\n<p>"disputes of the nature addressed here and which essentially involve no more than the question of who shall raise a child to maturity, do not implicate the federal interest in personal liberty sufficiently to warrant the extension of federal habeas corpus."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 146.  In support of this conclusion, Judge Garth reasoned that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is not the liberty interest of the children that is sought to be protected in such a case, but only the right of the particular parent to raise them."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 140 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>A second plurality of four, in an opinion written by Judge Adams, wrote that it "would appear to be both unwise and impolitic for the federal courts to uncover a whole new font of jurisdiction. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  He would have disposed of the case on the ground that Ms. Lehman did not have standing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 458 U. S. 507</a></p><p> to assert a habeas corpus action on behalf of her children.  <em>See id.</em> at 151-155.  This view was based on the conclusion that, once a parent\'s rights have been terminated in a state proceeding, a parent is no longer presumed to represent the interest of the child.  <em>See id.</em> at 153-154. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The question presented to this Court can be stated more fully as whether federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, under \xc2\xa7 2254, may be invoked to challenge the constitutionality of a state statute under which a State has obtained custody of children and has terminated involuntarily the parental rights of their natural parent.  As this is a question of importance not heretofore considered by this Court, and one over which the Circuits are divided, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] we granted certiorari.  454 U.S. 813 (1981).  We now affirm. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 458 U. S. 508</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioner seeks habeas corpus collateral review by a federal court of the Pennsylvania decision.  Her application was filed under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254(a):</p>\n<p>"The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>Although the language of \xc2\xa7 2254(a), especially in light of \xc2\xa7 2241, suggests that habeas corpus is available only to challenge the convictions of prisoners actually in the physical custody of the State, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] three modern cases have extended it to other situations involving challenges to state court decisions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 458 U. S. 509</a></p><p> The first of these cases is <em>Jones v. Cunningham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/236/case.html">371 U. S. 236</a></span> (1963), in which the Court allowed a parolee to challenge his conviction by a habeas petition.  The Court considered the parolee in "custody" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 2254(b) because</p>\n<p>"the custody and control of the Parole Board involve significant restraints on petitioner\'s liberty . . . which are in addition to those imposed by the State upon the public generally."</p>\n<p>371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/236/case.html#242">371 U. S. 242</a></span>.  And in <em>Carafas v. LaVallee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/234/case.html">391 U. S. 234</a></span> (1968), the Court allowed the writ in a challenge to a state court judgment even though the prisoner, incarcerated at the time the writ was filed, had finished serving his sentence during the proceedings.  The custody requirement had, of course, been met at the time the writ was filed, and the case was not moot, because Carafas was subject to "<em>collateral consequences\'" as a result of his conviction, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/234/case.html#237">391 U.

S. 239</a></span>.  Most recently, in <em>Hensley v. Municipal Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/case.html">411 U. S. 345</a></span> (1973), the Court allowed the writ to be used to challenge a state court conviction even though the defendant had been released on his own recognizance after sentencing but prior to the commencement of his incarceration.  The Court held that the defendant was in the custody of the State for purposes of \xc2\xa7 2254(b) because he was "subject to restraints `not shared by the public generally,\'" 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/case.html#351">411 U. S. 351</a></span> (citation omitted) -- indeed, his arrest was imminent. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 458 U. S. 510</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Thus, although the scope of the writ of habeas corpus has been extended beyond that which the most literal reading of the statute might require, the Court has never considered it a generally available federal remedy for every violation of federal rights.  Instead, past decisions have limited the writ\'s availability to challenges to state court judgments in situations where -- as a result of a state court criminal conviction -- a petitioner has suffered substantial restraints not shared by the public generally.  In addition, in each of these cases, the Court considered whether the habeas petitioner was "in custody" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 2254. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Ms. Lehman argues that her sons are involuntarily in the custody of the State for purposes of \xc2\xa7 2254 because they are in foster homes pursuant to an order issued by a state court.  Her sons, of course, are not prisoners.  Nor do they suffer any restrictions imposed by a state criminal justice system.  These factors alone distinguish this case from all other cases in which this Court has sustained habeas challenges to state court judgments.  Moreover, although the children have been placed in foster homes pursuant to an order of a Pennsylvania court, they are not in the "custody" of the State in the sense in which that term has been used by this Court in determining the availability of the writ of habeas corpus.  They are in the "custody" of their foster parents in essentially the same way, and to the same extent, other children are in the custody of their natural or adoptive parents.  Their situation in this respect differs little from the situation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 458 U. S. 511</a></p><p> of other children in the public generally; they suffer no unusual restraints not imposed on other children.  They certainly suffer no restraint on liberty as that term is used in <em>Hensley</em> and <em>Jones,</em> and they suffer no "collateral consequences" -- like those in <em>Carafas</em> -- sufficient to outweigh the need for finality.  The "custody" of foster or adoptive parents over a child is not the type of custody that traditionally has been challenged through federal habeas. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Ms. Lehman simply seeks to relitigate, through federal habeas, not any liberty interest of her sons, but the interest in her own parental rights. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Although a federal habeas corpus statute has existed ever since 1867, federal habeas has never been available to challenge parental rights or child custody. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Indeed, in two cases, the Court refused to allow the writ in such instances.  <em>Matters v. Ryan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/375/case.html">249 U. S. 375</a></span> (1919); <em>In re Burrus,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/136/586/case.html">136 U. S. 586</a></span> (1890).  These decisions rest on the absence of a federal question, but the opinions suggest that federal habeas corpus is not available to challenge child custody.  Moreover, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 458 U. S. 512</a></p><p> federal courts consistently have shown special solicitude for state interests "in the field of family and family-property arrangements."  <em>United States v. Yazell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/341/case.html">382 U. S. 341</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/341/case.html#352">382 U. S. 352</a></span> (1966).  Under these circumstances, extending the federal writ to challenges to state child custody decisions -- challenges based on alleged constitutional defects collateral to the actual custody decision -- would be an unprecedented expansion of the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Federalism concerns and the exceptional need for finality in child custody disputes argue strongly against the grant of Ms. Lehman\'s petition. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The writ of habeas corpus is a major exception to the doctrine of <em>res judicata,</em> as it allows relitigation of a final state court judgment disposing of precisely the same claims.  Because of this tension between the State\'s interest in finality and the asserted federal interest, federal courts properly have been reluctant to extend the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 458 U. S. 513</a></p><p> writ beyond its historic purpose.  As Judge Campbell noted in <em>Sylvander v. New England Home for Little Wanderers:</em></p>\n<p>"Federal habeas involves a substantial thrust by the federal system into the sphere normally reserved to the states, and hence a change in the federal-state balance.  This is so because the federal habeas remedy, as recently fashioned, offers a federal forum regardless of what state proceedings have already taken place, and, in effect, allows a single federal district judge to overrule the judgment of the highest state court, unfettered by the constraints of collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata.</em>"</p>\n<p>584 F.2d at 1111-1112. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>The State\'s interest in finality is unusually strong in child custody disputes.  The grant of federal habeas would prolong uncertainty for children such as the Lehman sons, possibly lessening their chances of adoption.  It is undisputed that children require secure, stable, long-term, continuous relationships with their parents or foster parents.  There is little that can be as detrimental to a child\'s sound development as uncertainty over whether he is to remain in his current "home," under the care of his parents or foster parents, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 458 U.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that habeas corpus should be available to her because it has been used as a procedure in child custody cases in various States and in England.  She notes that, in <em>Jones v. Cunningham,</em> 371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/236/case.html#238">371 U. S. 238</a></span>-240, the Court indicated that, in construing the habeas statute, reference may be made to the common law and to practices in the States and in England.  It is true that habeas has been used in child custody cases in England and in many of the States.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/236/case.html#239">371 U. S. 239</a></span>-240, and nn. 8, 12, and 13, citing <em>Ford v. Ford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/187/case.html">371 U. S. 187</a></span> (1962); <em>Boardman v. Boardman,</em> 135 Conn.124, 138, 62 A.2d 521, 528 (1948); <em>Ex parte Swall,</em> 36 Nev. 171, 174, 134 P. 96, 97 (1913); <em>Ex parte M\'Clellan,</em> 1 Dowl. 81 (K.B. 1831); <em>Earl of Westmeath v. Countess of Westmeath,</em> as set out in reporter\'s footnote in <em>Lyons v. Blenkin,</em> 1 Jac. 245, 264, 37 Eng.Rep. 842, 848 (Ch. 1821).  As these cases illustrate, the term "custody" in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255 -- authorizing federal court collateral review of federal decisions -- could be construed to include the type of custody the Lehman children are subject to, since they are in foster homes pursuant to court orders.  But reliance on what may be appropriate <em>within</em> the federal system or <em>within</em> a state system is of little force where -- as in this case -- a <em>state judgment</em> is attacked collaterally in a federal court.  It is one thing to use a proceeding called "habeas corpus" in resolving child custody disputes within a single system obligated to resolve such disputes.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 458 U. S. 515</a></p><p> The question in such a case may be which procedure is most appropriate.  The system is free to set time limits on the bringing of such actions, as well as to impose other requirements to ensure finality and a speedy resolution of disputes in cases involving child custody or termination of parental rights.  In this case, however, petitioner would have the federal judicial system entertain a writ that is not time-barred to challenge collaterally a final judgment entered in a state judicial system.  In <em>Sylvander v. New England Home for Little Wanderers,</em> the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit gave a compelling answer to this argument:</p>\n<p>"Federal habeas, when applied to persons under state control, is a procedure of unique potency within the federal-state framework, having far different and more far-reaching consequences than a state\'s utilization of habeas within its own system.  State utilization of habeas to test the legal custody of a child is part of the fabric of its reserved jurisdiction over child custody matters.  If a habeas remedy were not provided, some other procedure would be needed to effectuate the state\'s substantive interest in these relationships.  It is purely a matter of procedural detail whether the remedy is called \'habeas\' or something else.  The federal government, however, has no parallel substantive interest in child custody matters that federal habeas would serve.  The sole federal interest is in the constitutional issues collateral to such disputes.  At bottom, the question is whether these constitutional issues can be adequately raised through the usual channels -- appeal, certiorari and the civil rights statutes -- or whether the vehicle of federal habeas, with its unique features, is required."</p>\n<p>584 F.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The considerations in a child custody case are quite different from those present in any prior case in which this Court has sustained federal court jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 2254.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 458 U. S. 516</a></p><p> federal writ of habeas corpus, representing as it does a profound interference with state judicial systems and the finality of state decisions, should be reserved for those instances in which the federal interest in individual liberty is so strong that it outweighs federalism and finality concerns. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Congress has indicated no intention that the reach of \xc2\xa7 2254 encompass a claim like that of petitioner.  We therefore hold that \xc2\xa7 2254 does not confer federal court jurisdiction.  The decision below, affirming the denial of a writ of habeas corpus, therefore is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner has never been married.

The other two sons, Bill and Mark, are now 12 and 16, respectively.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The judge relied on the Pennsylvania statute which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"The rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated after a petition filed on any of the following grounds:"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(2) The repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental wellbeing and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent."</p>\n<p>23 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 2511(a) (1980).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>This decision appeared to have been a strategic one, making possible, in the event this Court did not grant plenary review, the filing of a habeas corpus petition in federal district court without any problem of <em>res judicata</em> on the federal issues as a result of this Court\'s summary affirmance or dismissal of the appeal for want of a substantial federal question.  At oral argument, however, petitioner\'s lawyer also explained that he was confused as to whether he could appeal both the facial attack on the statute and the challenge to the statute as applied, and had therefore chosen the more conservative route of seeking a petition for a writ of certiorari on both issues.  <em>See</em> Tr. Oral Arg. 21-22.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Chief Judge Seitz filed a separate concurring opinion.  He found the case "most difficult," noting that "the literal statutory requirements for exercise of section 2254 federal habeas corpus jurisdiction can be said to be satisfied."  648 F.2d at 155.  But he nevertheless concurred in the result because habeas corpus has never been used to challenge state child custody decisions, and "such a major departure from traditional uses of federal habeas corpus to challenge state court judgments" should "await a congressional directive on the matter."  <em>Id.</em> at 156.</p>\n<p>Judge Rosenn, joined by two other judges, dissented.  He stressed that</p>\n<p>"[t]he total extinction of a familial relationship between children and their biological parents is the most drastic measure that a state can impose, short of criminal sanctions."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163.  Judge Gibbons also filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that there was federal subject matter jurisdiction, and that habeas corpus should be an available remedy because a decision terminating parental rights has ongoing effects.  <em>Id.</em> at 177.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The federal courts have split on this issue.  Only one court other than the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has addressed the question in a full opinion; in <em>Sylvander v. New England Home for Little Wanderers,</em> 584 F.2d 1103 (1978), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that habeas corpus could not be used to avoid the finality of prior state court child custody proceedings, with a rationale much like Judge Garth\'s in the instant case.  Other federal courts have assumed -- without full analysis -- that habeas jurisdiction lies.  <em>See Davis v. Page,</em> 640 F.2d 599, 602 (CA5 1981) (en banc); <em>Rowell v. Oesterle,</em> 626 F.2d 437 (CA5 1980).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2241 (empowering federal judges to grant such writs; subsection (c) provides that "[t]he writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a <em>prisoner</em> unless . . .") (emphasis added); <em>see also</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254(b) ("An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall . . . be granted unless [state remedies have not been exhausted or are not available, or there are] circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights of the <em>prisoner</em>") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>When habeas corpus is made available by a federal court to challenge custody by <em>federal</em> entities, federalism concerns are not implicated.  The only relevant question then is what federal remedy may be available.  The grant of habeas relief in such instances -- <em>e.g., Strait v. Laird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/341/case.html">406 U. S. 341</a></span> (1972) (inactive Army Reserve member allowed to bring habeas petition to challenge his military obligation); <em>Brownell v.

As Judge Garth noted in his decision below:</p>\n<p>"[T]he writ assumes even more profound implications when its operation cuts across the federal and state judicial systems.  In this latter context, the writ empowers a single federal judge to overrule determinations of federal issues which have been adjudicated by the highest court of a state."</p>\n<p>648 F.2d at 139.</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction to challenge both state and federal judgments is conferred by \xc2\xa7 2241.  But \xc2\xa7 2254, conferring general jurisdiction to consider collateral attacks on state judgments, has no relevance to <em>federal</em> habeas proceedings challenging federal custody of nonprisoners.  Thus, federal decisions made pursuant to \xc2\xa7 2241 constitute no authority for the claim of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 2254 in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Hensley,</em> the State would have placed the petitioner behind bars, but was prevented by a stay entered by the state trial court that subsequently was extended by two Justices of this Court.  411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/case.html#351">411 U.

Thus, although <em>Hensley</em> held the writ to be available in a case in which there was no actual custody in a state penal institution at the time the writ was filed, the extension was in the context of a person who had a strong claim to be treated as a prisoner for jurisdictional purposes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Hensley,</em> 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/345/case.html">411 U.

Moreover, for at least 100 years after passage of the statute in 1867, the writ was not used in child custody cases.  This history strongly suggests that the extension of federal habeas corpus to state custody cases was never contemplated by Congress, nor understood by the Bar to have been an available remedy.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains that the approval of habeas jurisdiction in this case may be limited.  She suggests that it could be available only when the State takes the child away from its natural parents, but not when the State simply determines custody in a routine intrafamily dispute.  It is not apparent that such distinctions are possible, either in legal theory or as a practical matter.  The circumstances of custody vary widely, though in each disputed case the child is in the custody of one person -- over the objections of someone else -- by order of a state court.  We see no principled basis for distinguishing between the claim of a natural parent and the claim of grandparents or even the claim of an unrelated person who has been given legal custody that is challenged by a third party.  Moreover, the arguments of <em>res judicata</em> and federalism apply with equal force in every collateral attack on a state custody decision in a federal court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent suggests that comity and federalism concerns cannot inform a court\'s construction of a statute in determining a question of jurisdiction over certain kinds of cases.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/502/case.html#522">458 U.

English common law courts traditionally were authorized to order the release of minor children from unlawful custody. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Relying on the English tradition, American state courts very early asserted their own power to issue common law habeas writs in child custody matters.  <em>See generally</em> Oaks, Habeas Corpus in the States -- 1776-1865, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 243, 270-274 (1965).</p>\n<p>While acknowledging that "habeas has been used in child custody cases in England and in many of the States," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/502/case.html#514">458 U.

Yet because unadopted children whose ties with their natural parents have been severed are wards of the State, the State decides where they will live, reserves the right to move them to new physical settings at will, and consents to their marriage, their enlistment in the Armed Forces, as well as all major decisions regarding medical, psychiatric, and surgical treatment.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 and 18, citing 23 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 2521(c) (1980).</p>\n<p>This Court has found the statutory concept of "custody" broad enough to confer jurisdiction on federal courts to hear </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 458 U.

Under these precedents, I have difficulty finding that minor children, who, as state wards, are fully subject to state court custody orders, are not sufficiently and peculiarly restrained to be deemed "in custody" for the purposes of the habeas corpus statute.  <em>Cf.

Although the Court\'s decisions involving collateral attack by state prisoners against state criminal convictions have recognized similar federalism and finality concerns, they have never held that those interests erect jurisdictional bars to relief.  To the contrary, the Court has carefully separated the question whether federal courts have the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus from the question whether,</p>\n<p>"in some circumstances considerations of comity and concerns for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 458 U.

In my view, the difficult discretionary question in this case is whether, 11 years after petitioner voluntarily relinquished her sons to state custody and 4 years after the involuntary termination of her parental rights was affirmed on direct appeal, she remains a proper "next friend" to apply for the federal habeas writ on behalf of her natural children.</p>\n<p>As amended in 1948, the federal habeas statute permits a third-party application for habeas relief only if it is "signed and verified by the person for whose relief it is intended or <em>by someone acting in his behalf.</em>"  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2242 (emphasis added).  "But one who so signs and verifies does not thereby become the applicant"; the person under detention remains the real party in interest.  <em>Nash ex rel. Hashimoto v.

For that reason, the "next friend" application has been uncommonly granted, <em>see Weber v. Garza,</em> 570 F.2d 511, 513-514 (CA5 1978); <em>United States ex rel. Bryant v.

American common law courts, however, soon relied on Lord Mansfield\'s language in <em>King v. Delaval, see</em> <l=|458 1|="" 502fn2="" u.s.="">n. 1, <em>supra,</em> to resolve custody disputes initiated by way of a habeas writ in a manner best adapted to serve the welfare of the child.  <em>See</em> Oaks, Habeas Corpus in the States -- 1776-1865, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 270 and 274.

Moreover, in filing her federal habeas petition, petitioner expressly did not seek to disturb the state trial court\'s factual findings.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioner 6.  Those findings made</p>\n<p>"absolutely clear . . . that, by reason of her very limited social and intellectual development combined with her five-year separation from the children, [petitioner] is incapable of providing minimal care, control and supervision for the three children.
