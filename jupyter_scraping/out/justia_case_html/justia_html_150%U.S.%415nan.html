The appeal was allowed January 14, 1890, conditioned on giving bond, and certain findings of the supreme court were filed that day.  January 24, 1890, the required bond was approved and filed, and the record was filed here March 14, 1890 at October term, 1889.  No citation was issued and served, nor has any appearance for appellee been entered, nor is any waiver of citation shown.</p>\n<p>It must be regarded as settled that:  (1) where an appeal is allowed in open court and perfected during the term at which the decree or judgment appealed from was rendered, no citation is necessary; (2) where the appeal is allowed at the term of the decree or judgment, but not perfected until after the term, a citation is necessary to bring in the parties; but if the appeal be docketed here at our next ensuing term, or the record reaches the clerk\'s hands seasonably for that term, and legal excuse exists for lack of docketing, a citation may be issued, by leave of this Court, although the time for taking the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 150 U.
