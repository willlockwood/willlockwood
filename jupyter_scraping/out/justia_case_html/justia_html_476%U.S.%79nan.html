The prosecutor then used his peremptory challenges to strike all four black persons on the venire, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected.  Defense counsel moved to discharge the jury on the ground that the prosecutor\'s removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner\'s rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws.  Without expressly ruling on petitioner\'s request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted petitioner.  Affirming the conviction, the Kentucky Supreme Court observed that recently, in another case, it had relied on <em>Swain v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U.

However, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the defendant that the State will not exclude members of his race from the jury venire on account of race, or on the false assumption that members of his race as a group are not qualified to serve as jurors.  By denying a person participation in jury service on account of his race, the State also unconstitutionally discriminates against the excluded juror.  Moreover, selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.

Alabama, supra,</em> concerning the evidentiary burden placed on a defendant who claims that he has been denied equal protection through the State\'s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges is rejected.  In <em>Swain,</em> it was held that a black defendant could make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of purposeful discrimination on proof that the peremptory challenge system as a whole was being perverted.  Evidence offered by the defendant in <em>Swain</em> did not meet that standard, because it did not demonstrate the circumstances under which prosecutors in the jurisdiction were responsible for striking black jurors beyond the facts of the defendant\'s case.  This evidentiary formulation is inconsistent with equal protection standards subsequently developed in decisions relating to selection of the jury venire.  A defendant may make a <em>prima facie</em> showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying solely on the facts concerning its selection in his case.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#89">476 U. S. 89</a></span>-96.</p>\n<p>3. A defendant may establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of purposeful discrimination solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\'s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\'s trial.  The defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\'s race.  The defendant may also rely on the fact that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.  Finally, the defendant must show that such facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.  Once the defendant makes a <em>prima facie</em> showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors.  The prosecutor may not rebut a <em>prima facie</em> showing by stating that he challenged the jurors on the assumption that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race or by affirming his good faith in individual selections.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span> (1965), concerning the evidentiary burden placed on a criminal defendant who claims that he has been denied equal protection through the State\'s use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his race from the petit jury. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner, a black man, was indicted in Kentucky on charges of second-degree burglary and receipt of stolen goods.  On the first day of trial in Jefferson Circuit Court, the judge conducted <em>voir dire</em> examination of the venire, excused certain jurors for cause, and permitted the parties to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 476 U. S. 83</a></p><p> exercise peremptory challenges. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to strike all four black persons on the venire, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected.  Defense counsel moved to discharge the jury before it was sworn on the ground that the prosecutor\'s removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner\'s rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws.  Counsel requested a hearing on his motion.  Without expressly ruling on the request for a hearing, the trial judge observed that the parties were entitled to use their peremptory challenges to "strike anybody they want to."  The judge then denied petitioner\'s motion, reasoning that the cross-section requirement applies only to selection of the venire, and not to selection of the petit jury itself.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted petitioner on both counts.  On appeal to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, petitioner pressed, among other claims, the argument concerning the prosecutor\'s use of peremptory challenges.  Conceding that <em>Swain v. Alabama, supra,</em> apparently foreclosed an equal protection claim based solely on the prosecutor\'s conduct in this case, petitioner urged the court to follow decisions of other States, <em>People v. Wheeler,</em> 22 Cal.3d 258, 583 P.2d 748 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Soares,</em> 377 Mass. 461, 387 N.E.2d 499, <em>cert. denied,</em> 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and to hold that such conduct violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment and \xc2\xa7 11 of the Kentucky Constitution to a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.  Petitioner also contended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 476 U. S. 84</a></p><p> that the facts showed that the prosecutor had engaged in a "pattern" of discriminatory challenges in this case and established an equal protection violation under <em>Swain.</em></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed.  In a single paragraph, the court declined petitioner\'s invitation to adopt the reasoning of <em>People v. Wheeler, supra,</em> and <em>Commonwealth v. Soares, supra.</em>  The court observed that it recently had reaffirmed its reliance on <em>Swain,</em> and had held that a defendant alleging lack of a fair cross-section must demonstrate systematic exclusion of a group of jurors from the venire.  <em>See Commonwealth v. McFerron,</em> 680 S.W.2d 924 (1984).  We granted certiorari, 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Swain v.

That decision laid the foundation for the Court\'s unceasing efforts to eradicate racial discrimination in the procedures used to select the venire from which individual jurors are drawn.

Thus, the Court has found a denial of equal protection where the procedures implementing a neutral statute operated to exclude persons from the venire on racial grounds, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and has made clear that the Constitution prohibits all forms of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of jurors. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  While decisions of this Court have been concerned largely with discrimination during selection of the venire, the principles announced there also forbid discrimination on account of race in selection of the petit jury.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  To preserve the peremptory nature of the prosecutor\'s challenge, the Court in <em>Swain</em> declined to scrutinize his actions in a particular case by relying on a presumption that he properly exercised the State\'s challenges.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#221">380 U. S. 221</a></span>-222.</p>\n<p>The Court went on to observe, however, that a State may not exercise its challenges in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause.  It was impermissible for a prosecutor to use his challenges to exclude blacks from the jury "for reasons wholly unrelated to the outcome of the particular case on trial," or to deny to blacks "the same right and opportunity to participate in the administration of justice enjoyed by the white population."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#224">380 U. S. 224</a></span>.  Accordingly, a black defendant could make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of purposeful discrimination on proof that the peremptory challenge system was "being perverted" in that manner.  <em>Ibid.</em>  For example, an inference of purposeful discrimination would be raised on evidence that a prosecutor,</p>\n<p>"in case after case, whatever the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 476 U. S. 92</a></p><p> circumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the removal of Negroes who have been selected as qualified jurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived challenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever serve on petit juries."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#223">380 U. S. 223</a></span>.  Evidence offered by the defendant in <em>Swain</em> did not meet that standard.  While the defendant showed that prosecutors in the jurisdiction had exercised their strikes to exclude blacks from the jury, he offered no proof of the circumstances under which prosecutors were responsible for striking black jurors beyond the facts of his own case.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#224">380 U. S. 224</a></span>-228.</p>\n<p>A number of lower courts following the teaching of <em>Swain</em> reasoned that proof of repeated striking of blacks over a number of cases was necessary to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Since this interpretation of <em>Swain</em> has placed on defendants a crippling burden of proof, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] prosecutors\' peremptory challenges are now largely immune </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 476 U. S. 93</a></p><p> from constitutional scrutiny.  For reasons that follow, we reject this evidentiary formulation as inconsistent with standards that have been developed since <em>Swain</em> for assessing a <em>prima facie</em> case under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Since the decision in <em>Swain,</em> we have explained that our cases concerning selection of the venire reflect the general equal protection principle that the "invidious quality" of governmental action claimed to be racially discriminatory "must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose."  <em>Washington v.

As in any equal protection case, the "burden is, of course," on the defendant who alleges discriminatory selection of the venire "to prove the existence of purposeful discrimination."  <em>Whitus v.

We have observed that, under some circumstances, proof of discriminatory impact</p>\n<p>"may, for all practical purposes, demonstrate unconstitutionality because, in various circumstances, the discrimination is very difficult to explain on nonracial grounds."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  For example, "total or seriously disproportionate exclusion of Negroes from jury venires," <em>ibid.,</em> "is itself such an <em>unequal application of the law . . . as to show intentional discrimination,\'"  <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#241">426 U.

This combination of factors raises the necessary inference of purposeful discrimination because the Court has declined to attribute to chance the absence of black citizens on a particular jury array where the selection mechanism is subject to abuse.

These principles support our conclusion that a defendant may establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\'s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\'s trial.  To establish such a case, the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, <em>Castaneda v. Partida, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/482/case.html#494">430 U. S. 494</a></span>, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\'s race.  Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits "those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate."  <em>Avery v. Georgia,</em> 345 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/559/case.html#562">345 U. S. 562</a></span>.  Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.  This combination of factors in the empaneling of the petit jury, as in the selection of the venire, raises the necessary inference of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p>In deciding whether the defendant has made the requisite showing, the trial court should consider all relevant circumstances.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 476 U. S. 97</a></p><p> For example, a "pattern" of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.  Similarly, the prosecutor\'s questions and statements during <em>voir dire</em> examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.  These examples are merely illustrative.  We have confidence that trial judges, experienced in supervising <em>voir dire,</em> will be able to decide if the circumstances concerning the prosecutor\'s use of peremptory challenges creates a <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination against black jurors.</p>\n<p>Once the defendant makes a <em>prima facie</em> showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors.  Though this requirement imposes a limitation in some cases on the full peremptory character of the historic challenge, we emphasize that the prosecutor\'s explanation need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.  <em>See McCray v. Abrams,</em> 750 F.2d at 1132; <em>Booker v. Jabe,</em> 775 F.2d 762, 773 (CA6 1985), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 85-1028.  But the prosecutor may not rebut the defendant\'s <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination by stating merely that he challenged jurors of the defendant\'s race on the assumption -- or his intuitive judgment -- that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race.  <em>Cf. Norris v. Alabama,</em> 294 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/587/case.html#598">294 U. S. 598</a></span>-599; <em>see Thompson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/1024/case.html">469 U. S. 1024</a></span>, 1026 (1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Just as the Equal Protection Clause forbids the States to exclude black persons from the venire on the assumption that blacks as a group are unqualified to serve as jurors, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#86">476 U. S. 86</a></span>, so it forbids the States to strike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased in a particular case simply because the defendant is black.  The core guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their State will not discriminate on account of race, would be meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 476 U. S. 98</a></p><p> such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors\' race.  Nor may the prosecutor rebut the defendant\'s case merely by denying that he had a discriminatory motive or "affirm[ing] [his] good faith in making individual selections."  <em>Alexander v. Louisiana,</em> 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/625/case.html#632">405 U. S. 632</a></span>.  If these general assertions were accepted as rebutting a defendant\'s <em>prima facie</em> case, the Equal Protection Clause "would be but a vain and illusory requirement."  <em>Norris v. Alabama, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/587/case.html#598">294 U. S. 598</a></span>.  The prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The State contends that our holding will eviscerate the fair trial values served by the peremptory challenge.  Conceding that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to peremptory challenges and that <em>Swain</em> did state that their use ultimately is subject to the strictures of equal protection, the State argues that the privilege of unfettered exercise of the challenge is of vital importance to the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>While we recognize, of course, that the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our trial procedures, we do not agree that our decision today will undermine the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 476 U. S. 99</a></p><p> contribution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.  The reality of practice, amply reflected in many state and federal court opinions, shows that the challenge may be, and unfortunately at times has been, used to discriminate against black jurors.  By requiring trial courts to be sensitive to the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, our decision enforces the mandate of equal protection and furthers the ends of justice. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In view of the heterogeneous population of our Nation, public respect for our criminal justice system and the rule of law will be strengthened if we ensure that no citizen is disqualified from jury service because of his race.</p>\n<p>Nor are we persuaded by the State\'s suggestion that our holding will create serious administrative difficulties.  In those States applying a version of the evidentiary standard we recognize today, courts have not experienced serious administrative burdens, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] and the peremptory challenge system has survived.  We decline, however, to formulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant\'s timely objection to a prosecutor\'s challenges. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 476 U. S. 100</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In this case, petitioner made a timely objection to the prosecutor\'s removal of all black persons on the venire.  Because the trial court flatly rejected the objection without requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action, we remand this case for further proceedings.  If the trial court decides that the facts establish, <em>prima facie,</em> purposeful discrimination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action, our precedents require that petitioner\'s conviction be reversed.  <em>E.g., Whitus v. Georgia,</em> 385 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/545/case.html#549">385 U. S. 549</a></span>-550; <em>Hernandez v.

Van Dyke, Jury Selection Procedures:  Our Uncertain Commitment to Representative Panels 183-189 (1977).  Prior to <em>voir dire</em> examination, which serves as the basis for exercise of challenges, lawyers wish to know as much as possible about prospective jurors, including their age, education, employment, and economic status, so that they can ensure selection of jurors who at least have an open mind about the case.  In some jurisdictions, where a pool of jurors serves for a substantial period of time, <em>see id.</em> at 116-118, counsel also may seek to learn which members of the pool served on juries in other cases and the outcome of those cases.  Counsel even may employ professional investigators to interview persons who have served on a particular petit jury.  We have had no occasion to consider particularly this practice.  Of course, counsel\'s effort to obtain possibly relevant information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the practice at issue here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g. Vasquez v.

The standard we adopt under the Federal Constitution is designed to ensure that a State does not use peremptory challenges to strike any black juror because of his race.  We have no reason to believe that prosecutors will not fulfill their duty to exercise their challenges only for legitimate purposes.  Certainly, this Court may assume that trial judges, in supervising <em>voir dire</em> in light of our decision today, will be alert to identify a <em>prima facie</em> case of purposeful discrimination.  Nor do we think that this historic trial practice, which long has served the selection of an impartial jury, should be abolished because of an apprehension that prosecutors and trial judges will not perform conscientiously their respective duties under the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, in <em>People v.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span> (1965), that the Constitution does not require in any given case an inquiry into the prosecutor\'s reasons for using his peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the petit jury panel in the criminal trial of a black defendant, and that, in such a case, it will be presumed that the prosecutor is acting for legitimate trial-related reasons.  The Court now rules that such use of peremptory challenges in a given case may, but does not necessarily, raise an inference, which the prosecutor carries the burden of refuting, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 476 U.

I do so because <em>Swain</em> itself indicated that the presumption of legitimacy with respect to the striking of black venire persons could be overcome by evidence that, over a period of time, the prosecution had consistently excluded blacks from petit juries. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html">*</a></span>  This should have warned prosecutors that using peremptories to exclude blacks on the assumption that no black juror could fairly judge a black defendant would violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>It appears, however, that the practice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in cases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so that I agree that an opportunity to inquire should be afforded when this occurs.  If the defendant objects, the judge, in whom the Court puts considerable trust, may determine that the prosecution must respond.  If not persuaded otherwise, the judge may conclude that the challenges rest on the belief that blacks could not fairly try a black defendant.  This, in effect, attributes to the prosecutor the view that all blacks should be eliminated from the entire venire.  Hence, the Court\'s prior cases dealing with jury venires, rather than petit juries, are not without relevance in this case.</p>\n<p>The Court emphasizes that using peremptory challenges to strike blacks does not end the inquiry; it is not unconstitutional, without more, to strike one or more blacks from the jury.  The judge may not require the prosecutor to respond at all.  If he does, the prosecutor, who in most cases has had a chance to <em>voir dire</em> the prospective jurors, will have an opportunity to give trial-related reasons for his strikes -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 476 U.

But I agree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has, and I join its opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p>I would, however, adhere to the rule announced in <em>DeStefano v. Woods,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/631/case.html">392 U. S. 631</a></span> (1968), that <em>Duncan v.

The same result was reached in <em>DeStefano</em> with respect to the retroactivity of <em>Bloom v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/194/case.html">391 U.

The Court\'s opinion cogently explains the pernicious nature of the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, and the repugnancy of such discrimination to the Equal Protection Clause.  The Court\'s opinion also ably demonstrates the inadequacy of any burden of proof for racially discriminatory use of peremptories that requires that "justice . . . sit supinely by" and be flouted in case after case before a remedy is available. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I nonetheless write separately to express my views.  The decision today will not end the racial discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 476 U. S. 103</a></p><p> that peremptories inject into the jury selection process.  That goal can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A little over a century ago, this Court invalidated a state statute providing that black citizens could not serve as jurors.  <em>Strauder West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/case.html">100 U.

Although the means used to exclude blacks have changed, the same pernicious consequence has continued.</p>\n<p>Misuse of the peremptory challenge to exclude black jurors has become both common and flagrant.  Black defendants rarely have been able to compile statistics showing the extent of that practice, but the few cases setting out such figures are instructive.  <em>See United States v.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting, concedes that exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely because they are black, is at best based upon "crudely stereotypical and . . . in many cases hopelessly mistaken" notions.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#138">476 U.

Yet the Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State from taking any action based on crude, inaccurate racial stereotypes -- even an action that does not serve the State\'s interests.  Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely because of race, can no more be justified by a belief that blacks are less likely than whites to consider fairly or sympathetically the State\'s case against a black defendant than it can be justified by the notion that blacks </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 476 U. S. 105</a></p><p> lack the "intelligence, experience, or moral integrity," <em>Neal, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/370/case.html#397">103 U. S. 397</a></span>, to be entrusted with that role.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I wholeheartedly concur in the Court\'s conclusion that use of the peremptory challenge to remove blacks from juries on the basis of their race violates the Equal Protection Clause.  I would go further, however, in fashioning a remedy adequate to eliminate that discrimination.  Merely allowing defendants the opportunity to challenge the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in individual cases will not end the illegitimate use of the peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p>Evidentiary analysis similar to that set out by the Court <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>-98 has been adopted as a matter of state law in States including Massachusetts and California.  Cases from those jurisdictions illustrate the limitations of the approach.  First, defendants cannot attack the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges at all unless the challenges are so flagrant as to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case.  This means, in those States, that where only one or two black jurors survive the challenges for cause, the prosecutor need have no compunction about striking them from the jury because of their race.  <em>See Commonwealth v. Robinson,</em> 382 Mass. 189, 195, 415 N.E.2d 805, 809-810 (1981) (no <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination where defendant is black, prospective jurors include three blacks and one Puerto Rican, and prosecutor excludes one for cause and strikes the remainder peremptorily, producing all-white jury); <em>People v. Rousseau,</em> 129 Cal.App.3d 526, 536-537, 179 Cal.Rptr. 892, 897-898 (1982) (no <em>prima facie</em> case where prosecutor peremptorily strikes only two blacks on jury panel).  Prosecutors are left free to discriminate against blacks in jury selection provided that they hold that discrimination to an "acceptable" level.</p>\n<p>Second, when a defendant can establish a <em>prima facie</em> case, trial courts face the difficult burden of assessing prosecutors\' motives.  <em>See King v. County of Nassau,</em> 581 F.Supp. 493, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 476 U. S. 106</a></p><p> 501-502 (EDNY 1984).  Any prosecutor can easily assert facially neutral reasons for striking a juror, and trial courts are ill-equipped to second-guess those reasons.  How is the court to treat a prosecutor\'s statement that he struck a juror because the juror had a son about the same age as defendant, <em>see People v. Hall,</em> 35 Cal.3d 161, 672 P.2d 854 (1983), or seemed "uncommunicative," <em>King, supra,</em> at 498, or "never cracked a smile" and, therefore "did not possess the sensitivities necessary to realistically look at the issues and decide the facts in this case," <em>Hall, supra,</em> at 165, 672 P.2d at 856?  If such easily generated explanations are sufficient to discharge the prosecutor\'s obligation to justify his strikes on nonracial grounds, then the protection erected by the Court today may be illusory.</p>\n<p>Nor is outright prevarication by prosecutors the only danger here.  "[I]t is even possible that an attorney may lie to himself in an effort to convince himself that his motives are legal."  <em>King, supra,</em> at 502.  A prosecutor\'s own conscious or unconscious racism may lead him easily to the conclusion that a prospective black juror is "sullen," or "distant," a characterization that would not have come to his mind if a white juror had acted identically.  A judge\'s own conscious or unconscious racism may lead him to accept such an explanation as well supported.  As JUSTICE REHNQUIST concedes, prosecutors\' peremptories are based on their "seat-of-the-pants instincts" as to how particular jurors will vote.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#138">476 U. S. 138</a></span>; <em>see also</em> THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'s dissenting opinion, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#123">476 U.

I believe that this case presents just such a choice, and I would resolve that choice by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely in criminal cases.</p>\n<p>Some authors have suggested that the courts should ban prosecutors\' peremptories entirely, but should zealously guard the defendant\'s peremptory as "essential to the fairness of trial by jury," <em>Lewis v.

We can maintain that balance, not by permitting both prosecutor and defendant to engage in racial discrimination in jury selection, but by banning the use of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 476 U. S. 108</a></p><p> peremptory challenges by prosecutors and by allowing the States to eliminate the defendant\'s peremptories as well.</p>\n<p>Much ink has been spilled regarding the historic importance of defendants\' peremptory challenges.  The approving comments of the <em>Lewis</em> and <em>Pointer</em> Courts are noted above; the <em>Swain</em> Court emphasized the "very old credentials" of the peremptory challenge, 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#212">380 U.

The potential for racial prejudice, further, inheres in the defendant\'s challenge as well.  If the prosecutor\'s peremptory challenge could be eliminated only at the cost of eliminating the defendant\'s challenge as well, I do not think that would be too great a price to pay.</p>\n<p>I applaud the Court\'s holding that the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges violates the Equal Protection Clause, and I join the Court\'s opinion.

In this case, however -- unlike <em>Connelly</em> and <em>T.L.O.</em> -- the party defending the judgment has explicitly rested on the issue in question as a controlling basis for affirmance.  In defending the Kentucky Supreme Court\'s judgment, Kentucky\'s Assistant Attorney General emphasized the State\'s position on the centrality of the equal protection issue:</p>\n<p>". . .  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before this Court today is simply whether <em>Swain versus Alabama</em> should be reaffirmed. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>". . .  We believe that it is the Fourteenth Amendment that is the item that should be challenged, and presents perhaps an address to the problem.  <em>Swain</em> dealt primarily with the use of peremptory challenges to strike individuals who were of a cognizable or identifiable group."</p>\n<p>"Petitioners show no case other than the State of California\'s case dealing with the use of peremptories wherein the Sixth Amendment was cited as authority for resolving the problem.  So we believe that the Fourteenth Amendment is indeed the issue.  That was the guts and primarily the basic concern of <em>Swain.</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"In closing, we believe that the trial court of Kentucky and the Supreme Court of Kentucky have firmly embraced <em>Swain,</em> and we respectfully request that this Court affirm the opinion of the Kentucky court, as well as to reaffirm <em>Swain versus Alabama.</em> [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]"</p>\n<p>In addition to the party\'s reliance on the equal protection argument in defense of the judgment, several <em>amici curiae</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 476 U. S. 110</a></p><p> also addressed that argument.

The pending petition for certiorari in <em>McCray</em> similarly raises the equal protection question that has long been central to this issue.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 84-1426 (Question 2).  Indeed, shortly after agreeing to hear <em>Batson,</em> the Court was presented with a motion to consolidate <em>McCray</em> and <em>Batson,</em> and consider the cases together.  Presumably because the Court believed that <em>Batson</em> adequately presented the issues with which other courts had consistently grappled in considering this question, the Court denied the motion.  <em>See Abrams v.

It does so on the basis of a constitutional argument that was rejected, without a single dissent, in <em>Swain Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span> (1965).  Reversal of such settled principles would be unusual enough on its own terms, for only three years ago we said that "<em>stare decisis,</em> while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question, is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law."  <em>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html">462 U. S. 416</a></span>, 420 (1983).  What makes today\'s holding truly extraordinary is that it is based on a constitutional argument that the petitioner has <em>expressly</em> declined to raise, both in this Court and in the Supreme Court of Kentucky.</p>\n<p>In the Kentucky Supreme Court, petitioner disclaimed specifically any reliance on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pressing instead only a claim based on the Sixth Amendment.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant 14 and Reply Brief for Appellant 1 in No. 84-SC-733-MR (Ky.).  As petitioner explained at oral argument here:</p>\n<p>"We have not made an equal protection claim. . . .  We have not made a specific argument in the briefs that have been filed either in the Supreme Court of Kentucky or in this Court saying that we are attacking <em>Swain</em> as such."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7.  Petitioner has not suggested any barrier prevented raising an equal protection claim in the Kentucky courts.  In such circumstances, review of an equal protection argument is improper </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 476 U. S. 113</a></p><p> in this Court:  "<em>The Court has consistently refused to decide federal constitutional issues raised here for the first time on review of state court decisions. . . .\'"  <em>Illinois v.

This provides an additional and completely separate procedural novelty to today\'s decision.  Petitioner\'s "question presented" involved only the</p>\n<p>"constitutional provisions guaranteeing the defendant an impartial jury and a jury composed of persons representing a fair cross-section of the community."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. i.  These provisions are found in the Sixth Amendment, not the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment relied upon by the Court.  In his brief on the merits, under a heading distinguishing equal protection cases, petitioner noted "the irrelevance of the <em>Swain</em> analysis to the present case," Brief for Petitioner 11; instead, petitioner relied solely on Sixth Amendment analysis found in cases such as <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html">419 U. S. 522</a></span> (1975).  During oral argument, counsel for petitioner was pointedly asked:</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Mr. Niehaus, <em>Swain</em> was an equal protection challenge, was it not?"</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  Yes."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Your claim here is based solely on the Sixth Amendment?"</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  Yes."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Is that correct?"</p>\n<p>"MR.

I think that <em>Swain</em> will have to be reconsidered to a certain extent, if only to consider the arguments that are made on behalf of affirmance by the respondent and the solicitor general."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  We have not made a specific argument in the briefs that have been filed either in the Supreme Court of Kentucky or in this Court saying that we are attacking <em>Swain</em> as such. . . ."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-7.  A short time later, after discussing the difficulties attendant with a Sixth Amendment claim, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  So I come back again to my question why you didn\'t attack <em>Swain</em> head on, but I take it, if the Court were to overrule <em>Swain,</em> you wouldn\'t like that result."</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  Simply overrule <em>Swain</em> without adopting the remedy?"</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  Yes."</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  I do not think that would give us much comfort, Your Honor, no."</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  That is a concession."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 10.  Later, petitioner\'s counsel refused to answer the Court\'s questions concerning the implications of a holding based on equal protection concerns:</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  . . . [T]here is no state action involved where the defendant is exercising his peremptory challenge. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 476 U. S. 115</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  But there might be under an equal protection challenge if it is the state system that allows that kind of a strike."</p>\n<p>"MR. NIEHAUS:  I believe that is possible.  I am really not prepared to answer that specific question. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 20.</p>\n<p>In reaching the equal protection issue despite petitioner\'s clear refusal to present it, the Court departs dramatically from its normal procedure without any explanation.  When we granted certiorari, we could have -- as we sometimes do -- directed the parties to brief the equal protection question in addition to the Sixth Amendment question.  <em>See, e.g., Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</em> 408 U.S. 921 (1972); <em>Colorado v. Connelly,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/1050/case.html">474 U. S. 1050</a></span> (1986).

Alternatively, we could have simply dismissed this petition as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p>The Court today rejects these accepted courses of action, choosing instead to reverse a 21-year-old unanimous constitutional holding of this Court on the basis of constitutional arguments expressly disclaimed by petitioner.  The only explanation for this action is found in JUSTICE STEVENS\' concurrence.  JUSTICE STEVENS apparently believes that this issue is properly before the Court because "the party defending the judgment has explicitly rested on the issue in question as a controlling basis for affirmance."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#109">476 U. S. 109</a></span>.  <em>Cf. Illinois v. Gates,</em> 459 U.S. at 1029, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) ("[T]here is no impediment to presenting a new argument as an alternative basis for <em>affirming</em> the decision below") (emphasis in original).  To be sure, respondent and supporting <em>amici</em> did cite <em>Swain</em> and the Equal Protection Clause.  But their arguments were largely limited to explaining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 476 U. S. 117</a></p><p> that <em>Swain</em> placed a negative gloss on the Sixth Amendment claim actually raised by petitioner.  In any event, it is a strange jurisprudence that looks to the arguments made by respondent to determine the breadth of the questions presented for our review by petitioner.  Of course, such a view is directly at odds with our Rule 21.1(a), which provides that "[o]nly the questions set forth in the petition or fairly included therein will be considered by the Court."  JUSTICE STEVENS does not cite, and I am not aware of, any case in this Court\'s nearly 200-year history where the alternative grounds urged by respondent to affirm a judgment were then seized upon to permit petitioner to obtain relief from that very judgment despite petitioner\'s failure to urge that ground.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS also observes that several <em>amici curiae</em> address the equal protection argument.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#109">476 U. S. 109</a></span>-110, and n. 3.  But I thought it well settled that, even if a "point is made in an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief," if the claim "has never been advanced by petitioners, . . . we have no reason to pass upon it."  <em>Knetsch v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/361/case.html">364 U.

S. 370</a></span> (1960).</p>\n<p>When objections to peremptory challenges were brought to this Court three years ago, JUSTICE STEVENS agreed with JUSTICE MARSHALL that the challenge involved "a significant and recurring question of constitutional law."  <em>McCray v. New York,</em> 461 U.S. 961, 963 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), <em>referred to with approval, id.</em> at 961 (opinion of STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari).  Nonetheless, JUSTICE STEVENS wrote that the issue could be dealt with "more wisely at a later date."  <em>Id.</em> at 962.  The same conditions exist here today.  JUSTICE STEVENS concedes that reargument of this case "might enable some of us to have a better informed view of a problem that has been percolating in the courts for several years."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#110">476 U.

Thus, at bottom, his position is that we should overrule an extremely important prior constitutional decision of this Court on a claim not advanced here, even though briefing and oral </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 476 U. S. 118</a></p><p> argument on this claim might convince us to do otherwise. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]  I believe that "[d]ecisions made in this manner are unlikely to withstand the test of time."  <em>United States v.

Before contemplating such a holding, I would at least direct reargument and briefing on the issue of whether the equal protection holding in <em>Swain</em> should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because the Court nonetheless chooses to decide this case on the equal protection grounds not presented, it may be useful to discuss this issue as well.  The Court acknowledges, albeit in a footnote, the "<em>very old credentials\'" of the peremptory challenge and the "`widely held belief that peremptory challenge is a necessary part of trial by jury.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#91">476 U.

But proper resolution of this case requires more than a nodding reference to the purpose of the challenge.  Long ago, it was </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 476 U. S. 119</a></em></p><p><em> recognized that "[t]he right of challenge is almost essential for the purpose of securing perfect fairness and impartiality in a trial."  W. Forsyth, History of Trial by Jury 175 (1852).  The peremptory challenge has been in use without scrutiny into its basis for nearly as long as juries have existed.\n</em></p>\n<p>"It was in use amongst the Romans in criminal cases, and the <em>Lex Servilia</em> (B.C. 104) enacted that the accuser and the accused should severally propose one hundred <em>judices,</em> and that each might reject fifty from the list of the other, so that one hundred would remain to try the alleged crime."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.; see also</em> J. Pettingal, An Enquiry into the Use and Practice of Juries Among the Greeks and Romans 115, 135 (1769).</p>\n<p>In <em>Swain,</em> JUSTICE WHITE traced the development of the peremptory challenge from the early days of the jury trial in England:</p>\n<p>"In all trials for felonies at common law, the defendant was allowed to challenge peremptorily 35 jurors, and the prosecutor originally had a right to challenge any number of jurors without cause, a right which was said to tend to \'infinite delayes and danger.\'  Coke on Littleton 156 (14th ed. 1791).  Thus The Ordinance for Inquests, 33 Edw. 1, Stat. 4 (1305), provided that, if \'they that sue for the King will challenge any . . . Jurors, they shall assign . . . a Cause certain.\'  So persistent was the view that a proper jury trial required peremptories on both sides, however, that the statute was construed to allow the prosecution to direct any juror after examination to \'stand aside\' until the entire panel was gone over and the defendant had exercised his challenges; only if there was a deficiency of jurors in the box at that point did the Crown have to show cause in respect to jurors recalled to make up the required number.  Peremptories on both sides became the settled law of England, continuing in the above form until after the separation of the Colonies."</p>\n<p>380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#212">380 U.

In regard to trials for other offenses without the 1790 statute, both the defendant and the Government were thought to have a right of peremptory challenge, although the source of this right was not wholly clear. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The course in the States apparently paralleled that in the federal system.  The defendant\'s right of challenge was early conferred by statute, the number often corresponding to the English practice, the prosecution was thought to have retained the Crown\'s common law right to stand aside, and by 1870, most, if not all, States had enacted statutes conferring on the prosecution a substantial number of peremptory challenges, the number generally being at least half, but often equal to, the number had by the defendant."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#214">380 U.

One commentator has recognized:</p>\n<p>"The peremptory, made without giving any reason, avoids trafficking in the core of truth in most common stereotypes. . . .  Common human experience, common sense, psychosociological studies, and public opinion polls tell us that it is likely that certain classes of people statistically have predispositions that would make them inappropriate jurors for particular kinds of cases.  But to allow this knowledge to be expressed in the evaluative terms necessary for challenges for cause would undercut our desire for a society in which all people are judged as individuals, and in which each is held reasonable and open to compromise. . . .   [For example,] [a]lthough experience reveals that black males as a class can be biased against young alienated blacks who have not tried to join the middle class, to enunciate this in the concrete expression required of a challenge for cause is societally divisive.  Instead we have evolved in the peremptory challenge a system that allows the covert expression of what we dare not say, but know is true more often than not."</p>\n<p>Babcock, Voir Dire:  Preserving "Its Wonderful Power," 27 Stan.L.Rev. 545, 553-554 (1975).  For reasons such as these, this Court concluded in <em>Swain</em> that "the [peremptory] challenge is <em>one of the most important of the rights\'" in our justice system.  <em>Swain,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#219">380 U.

For close to a century, then, it has been settled that "[t]he denial or impairment of the right is reversible error without a showing of prejudice."  <em>Swain, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#219">380 U.

S. 122</a></p><p> violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  I too reaffirm that principle, which has been a part of our constitutional tradition since at least <em>Strauder West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/case.html">100 U. S. 303</a></span> (1880).  But if today\'s decision is nothing more than mere "application" of the "principles announced in <em>Strauder,</em>" as the Court maintains, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#89">476 U. S. 89</a></span>-90, some will consider it curious that the application went unrecognized for over a century.  The Court in <em>Swain</em> had no difficulty in unanimously concluding that cases such as <em>Strauder</em> did not require inquiry into the basis for a peremptory challenge.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#135">476 U. S. 135</a></span>-137 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  More recently we held that "[d]efendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition. . . ."  <em>Taylor v. Louisiana,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/case.html#538">419 U. S. 538</a></span>.</p>\n<p>A moment\'s reflection quickly reveals the vast differences between the racial exclusions involved in <em>Strauder</em> and the allegations before us today:</p>\n<p>"Exclusion from the venire summons process implies that the government (usually the legislative or judicial branch) . . . has made the general determination that those excluded are unfit to try <em>any</em> case.  Exercise of the peremptory challenge, by contrast, represents the discrete decision, made by one of two or more opposed <em>litigants</em> in the trial phase of our adversary system of justice, that the challenged venireperson will likely be more unfavorable to that litigant in that <em>particular case</em> than others on the same venire."</p>\n<p>"Thus, excluding a particular cognizable group from an venire pools is stigmatizing and discriminatory in several interrelated ways that the peremptory challenge is not.  The former singles out the excluded group, while individuals of all groups are equally subject to peremptory challenge on any basis, including their group affiliation.  Further, venire-pool exclusion bespeaks <em>a priori</em> across-the-board total unfitness, while peremptory-strike exclusion merely suggests potential partiality in a particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 476 U. S. 123</a></p><p> isolated case.  Exclusion from venires focuses on the inherent attributes of the excluded group and infers its <em>inferiority,</em> but the peremptory does not.  To suggest that a particular race is unfit to judge in any case necessarily is racially insulting.  To suggest that each race may have its own special concerns, or even may tend to favor its own, is not."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Leslie,</em> 783 F.2d 541, 554 (CA5 1986) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Unwilling to rest solely on jury venire cases such as <em>Strauder,</em> the Court also invokes general equal protection principles in support of its holding.  But peremptory challenges are often lodged, of necessity, for reasons</p>\n<p>"normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty."</p>\n<p><em>Swain, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#220">380 U. S. 220</a></span>.  Moreover, in making peremptory challenges, both the prosecutor and defense attorney necessarily act on only limited information or hunch.  The process cannot be indicted on the sole basis that such decisions are made on the basis of "assumption" or "intuitive judgment."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>.  As a result, unadulterated equal protection analysis is simply inapplicable to peremptory challenges exercised in any particular case.

[<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, it is quite probable that every peremptory challenge could be objected to on the basis that, because it excluded a venireman who had some characteristic not shared by the remaining members of the venire, it constituted a "classification" subject to equal protection scrutiny.  <em>See McCray v. Abrams,</em> 750 F.2d 1113, 1139 (CA2 1984) (Meskill, J., dissenting), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 84-1426.

Peremptory challenges have long been viewed as a means to achieve an impartial jury that will be sympathetic toward neither an accused nor witnesses for the State on the basis of some shared factor of race, religion, occupation, or other characteristic.  Nearly a century ago, the Court stated that the peremptory challenge is "essential to the fairness of trial by jury."  <em>Lewis v. United States,</em> 146 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/370/case.html#376">146 U. S. 376</a></span>.  Under conventional equal protection principles, a state interest of this magnitude and ancient lineage might well overcome an equal protection objection to the application of peremptory challenges.  However, the Court is silent on the strength of the State\'s interest, apparently leaving this issue, among many others, to the further "litigation [that] will be required to spell out the contours of the Court\'s equal protection holding today. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#102">476 U.

Challenges for cause obviously have to be explained; by definition, peremptory challenges do not.</p>\n<p>"It is called a peremptory challenge because the prisoner may challenge peremptorily, on his own dislike, <em>without showing of any cause.</em>"</p>\n<p>H. Joy, On Peremptory Challenge of Jurors 1 (1844) (emphasis added).  Analytically, there is no middle ground:  a challenge either has to be explained or it does not.  It is readily apparent, then, that to permit inquiry into the basis for a peremptory challenge would force "the peremptory challenge [to] collapse into the challenge for cause."  <em>United States v. Clark,</em> 737 F.2d 679, 682 (CA7 1984).  Indeed, the Court recognized without dissent in <em>Swain</em> that, if scrutiny were permitted,</p>\n<p>"[t]he challenge, <em>pro tanto,</em> would no longer be peremptory, each and every challenge being open to examination, either at the time of the challenge or at a hearing afterwards."</p>\n<p><em>Swain,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#222">380 U. S. 222</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Confronted with the dilemma it created, the Court today attempts to decree a middle ground.  To rebut a <em>prima facie</em> case, the Court requires a "neutral explanation" for the challenge, but is at pains to "emphasize" that the "explanation need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>.  I am at a loss to discern the governing principles here.  A "clear and reasonably specific" explanation of "legitimate reasons" for exercising the challenge will be difficult to distinguish from a challenge for cause.  Anything </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 476 U. S. 128</a></p><p> short of a challenge for cause may well be seen as an "arbitrary and capricious" challenge, to use Blackstone\'s characterization of the peremptory.  <em>See</em> 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *353.  Apparently the Court envisions permissible challenges short of a challenge for cause that are just a little bit arbitrary -- but not too much.  While our trial judges are "experienced in supervising <em>voir dire,</em> " <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>, they have no experience in administering rules like this.</p>\n<p>An example will quickly demonstrate how today\'s holding, while purporting to "further the ends of justice," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#99">476 U. S. 99</a></span>, will not have that effect.  Assume an Asian defendant, on trial for the capital murder of a white victim, asks prospective jury members, most of whom are white, whether they harbor racial prejudice against Asians.  <em>See Turner v. Murray, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/28/case.html#36">476 U. S. 36</a></span>-37.  The basis for such a question is to flush out any "juror who believes that [Asians] are violence-prone or morally inferior. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/28/case.html#35">476 U. S. 35</a></span>. [<a href="#F4/9" name="T4/9">Footnote 4/9</a>]  Assume further that all white jurors deny harboring racial prejudice, but that the defendant, on trial for his life, remains unconvinced by these protestations.  Instead, he continues to harbor a hunch, an "assumption," or "intuitive judgment," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>, that these white jurors will be prejudiced against him, presumably based in part on race.  The time-honored rule before today was that peremptory challenges could be exercised on such a basis.  The Court explained in <em>Lewis v. United States:</em></p>\n<p>"[H]ow necessary it is that a prisoner (when put to defend his life) should have good opinion of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him; the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 476 U. S. 129</a></p><p> he has conceived a prejudice even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike."</p>\n<p>146 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/370/case.html#376">146 U. S. 376</a></span>.  The effect of the Court\'s decision, however, will be to force the defendant to come forward and "articulate a neutral explanation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#98">476 U. S. 98</a></span>, for his peremptory challenge, a burden he probably cannot meet.  This example demonstrates that today\'s holding will produce juries that the parties do not believe are truly impartial.  This will surely do more than "disconcert" litigants; it will diminish confidence in the jury system.</p>\n<p>A further painful paradox of the Court\'s holding is that it is likely to interject racial matters back into the jury selection process, contrary to the general thrust of a long line of Court decisions and the notion of our country as a "melting pot."  In <em>Avery v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/559/case.html">345 U. S. 559</a></span> (1953), for instance, the Court confronted a situation where the selection of the venire was done through the selection of tickets from a box; the names of whites were printed on tickets of one color and the names of blacks were printed on different color tickets.  The Court had no difficulty in striking down such a scheme.  Justice Frankfurter observed that</p>\n<p>"opportunity for working of a discriminatory system exists whenever the mechanism for jury selection <em>has a component part,</em> such as the slips here, <em>that differentiates between white and colored. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/559/case.html#564">345 U. S. 564</a></span> (concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Today we mark the return of racial differentiation as the Court accepts a positive evil for a perceived one.  Prosecutors and defense attorneys alike will build records in support of their claims that peremptory challenges have been exercised in a racially discriminatory fashion by asking jurors to state their racial background and national origin for the record, despite the fact that "such questions may be offensive to some jurors, and thus are not ordinarily asked on <em>voir dire.</em>"  <em>People v. Motton,</em> 39 Cal.3d 596, 604, 704 P.2d </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 476 U. S. 130</a></p><p> 176, 180, <em>modified,</em> 40 Cal.3d 4b (1985) (advance sheet). [<a href="#F4/10" name="T4/10">Footnote 4/10</a>]  This process is sure to tax even the most capable counsel and judges, since determining whether a <em>prima facie</em> case has been established will "require a continued monitoring and recording of the <em>group\' composition of the panel present and prospective. . . ."  <em>People v. Wheeler,</em> 22 Cal.3d 258, 294, 583 P.2d 748, 773 (1978) (Richardson, J., dissenting).\n</em></p>\n<p>Even after a "record" on this issue has been created, disputes will inevitably arise.  In one case, for instance, a conviction was reversed based on the assumption that no blacks were on the jury that convicted a defendant.  <em>See People v. Motton, supra.</em>  However, after the court\'s decision was announced, Carolyn Pritchett, who had served on the jury, called the press to state that the court was in error, and that she was black.  71 A.B.A.J. 22 (Nov.1985).  The California court nonetheless denied a rehearing petition. [<a href="#F4/11" name="T4/11">Footnote 4/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court does not tarry long over any of these difficult, sensitive problems, preferring instead to gloss over them as swiftly as it slides over centuries of history:  "[W]e make no attempt to instruct [trial] courts how best to implement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 476 U. S. 131</a></p><p> our holding today."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#99">476 U. S. 99</a></span>-100, n. 24.  That leaves roughly 7,000 general jurisdiction state trial judges and approximately 500 federal trial judges at large to find their way through the morass the Court creates today.  The Court essentially wishes these judges well as they begin the difficult enterprise of sorting out the implications of the Court\'s newly created "right."  I join my colleagues in wishing the Nation\'s judges well as they struggle to grasp how to implement today\'s holding.  To my mind, however, attention to these "implementation" questions leads quickly to the conclusion that there is no "good" way to implement the holding, let alone a "best" way.  As one apparently frustrated judge explained after reviewing a case under a rule like that promulgated by the Court today, judicial inquiry into peremptory challenges</p>\n<p>"from case to case will take the courts into the quagmire of quotas for groups that are difficult to define and even more difficult to quantify in the courtroom.  The pursuit of judicial perfection will require both trial and appellate courts to provide speculative and impractical answers to artificial questions."</p>\n<p><em>Holley v. J &amp; S Sweeping Co.,</em> 143 Cal.App.3d 588, 595-596, 192 Cal.Rptr. 74, 79 (1983) (Holmdahl, J., concurring) (footnote omitted).

Levin &amp; R. Wheeler eds.1979).  Pound warned then that "too much of the current dissatisfaction has a just origin in our judicial organization and procedure."  <em>Id.</em> at 352.

S. 297</a></span> (1967)."</p>\n<p>If we are to ignore Justice Harlan\'s admonition that making constitutional changes prospective only "cuts this Court loose from the force of precedent," <em>Mackey v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html">401 U. S. 667</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/case.html#680">401 U. S. 680</a></span> (1971) (concurring in judgment), then all three of these factors point conclusively to a nonretroactive holding.  With respect to the first factor, the new rule the Court announces today is not designed to avert "the clear danger of convicting the innocent."  <em>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html">382 U. S. 406</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/406/case.html#416">382 U.

Second, it is readily apparent that "law enforcement authorities and state courts have justifiably relied on a prior rule of law. . . ."  <em>Solem,</em> 465 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#645">465 U. S. 645</a></span>-646.  Today\'s holding clearly "overrule[s] [a] prior decision" and drastically "transform[s] standard practice."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#647">465 U.

Third, applying today\'s decision retroactively obviously would lead to a whole host of problems, if not utter chaos.  Determining whether a defendant has made a "<em>prima facie</em> showing" of invidious intent, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>, and, if so, whether the state has a sufficient "neutral explanation" for its actions, <em>ibid.,</em> essentially requires reconstructing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 476 U. S. 133</a></p><p> the entire <em>voir dire,</em> something that will be extremely difficult even if undertaken soon after the close of the trial. [<a href="#F4/12" name="T4/12">Footnote 4/12</a>]  In most cases, therefore, retroactive application of today\'s decision will be "a virtual impossibility."  <em>State v. Neil,</em> 457 So.2d 481, 488 (Fla.1984).</p>\n<p>In sum, under our prior holdings, it is impossible to construct even a colorable argument for retroactive application.  The few States that have adopted judicially created rules similar to that announced by the Court today have all refused full retroactive application.  <em>See People v. Wheeler,</em> 22 Cal.3d at 283, n. 31, 583 P.2d at 766, n. 31; <em>State v. Neil, supra,</em> at 488; <em>Commonwealth v.

[<a href="#F4/13" name="T4/13">Footnote 4/13</a>]  I therefore am persuaded by JUSTICE WHITE\'s position, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#102">476 U.

As one commentator aptly observed:</p>\n<p>"The real question is whether to tinker with a system, be it of jury selection or anything else, that has done the job for centuries.  We stand on the shoulders of our ancestors, as Burke said.  It is not so much that the past is always worth preserving, he argued, but rather that"</p>\n<p>"it is with infinite caution that any man ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice, which has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 476 U.

At the very least, this important case reversing centuries of history and experience ought to be set for reargument next Term.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Colorado v. Connelly,</em> JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, filed a memorandum objecting to this briefing of an additional question, explaining that</p>\n<p>"it is hardly for this Court to \'second chair\' the prosecutor to alter his strategy or guard him from mistakes.  Under this Court\'s Rule 21.1(a), \'[o]nly the questions set forth in the petition or fairly included therein will be considered by the Court.\'  Given petitioner\'s express disclaimer that [this] issue is presented, that question obviously is not \'fairly included\' in the question submitted.  The Court\'s direction that the parties address it anyway makes meaningless in this case the provisions of this Rule and is plainly cause for concern, particularly since it is clear that a similar dispensation would not be granted a criminal defendant, however strong his claim."</p>\n<p>474 U.S. at 1052.  If the Court\'s limited step of directing briefing on an additional point at the time certiorari was granted was "cause for concern," I would think <em>a fortiori</em> that the far more expansive action the Court takes today would warrant similar concern.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/2" name="F4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissented from the order directing reargument in <em>New Jersey v.

Evidently unable or unwilling to decide the question presented by the parties, the Court, instead of dismissing the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, orders reargument directed to the questions that [petitioner] decided not to bring here. . . .  Volunteering unwanted advice is rarely a wise course of action."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"I believe that the adversary process functions most effectively when we rely on the initiative of lawyers, rather than the activism of judges, to fashion the questions for review."</p>\n<p>468 U.S. at 1215-1216.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS\' proffered explanation notwithstanding, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#109">476 U.

To be sure, some of the discussion in these separate statements might be parsimoniously viewed as "[un]necessary to the disposition of the case or petition."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#111">476 U.

More important, in none of these separate statements was it even suggested that it would be proper to overturn a state court judgment on issues that had not been briefed and argued by petitioner in this Court, as the Court does today.  Finally, in <em>Colorado v. Connelly,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/1050/case.html">474 U. S. 1050</a></span> (1986), and <em>New Jersey v.

Surely the question rests on generalized, stereotypic racial notions that would be condemned on equal protection grounds in other contexts.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/10" name="F4/10">Footnote 4/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court has attempted to finesse this problem by asserting that</p>\n<p>"discrimination is more often based on appearances than verified racial descent, and a showing that the prosecution was systematically excusing persons who appear to be Black would establish a <em>prima facie</em> case"</p>\n<p>of racial discrimination.  <em>People v. Motton,</em> 39 Cal.3d at 604, 704 P.2d at 180.  This suggests, however, that proper inquiry here concerns not the actual race of the jurors who are excluded, but rather counsel\'s subjective impressions as to what race they spring from.  It is unclear just how a "record" of such impressions is to be made.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/11" name="F4/11">Footnote 4/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Similar difficulties may lurk in this case on remand.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html">380 U. S. 202</a></span> (1965), concerning</p>\n<p>"the evidentiary burden placed on a criminal defendant who claims that he has been denied equal protection through the State\'s use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his race from the petit jury."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#82">476 U. S. 82</a></span> (footnote omitted).  But in reality the majority opinion deals with much more than "evidentiary burden[s]."  With little discussion and less analysis, the Court also overrules one of the fundamental substantive holdings of <em>Swain,</em> namely, that the State may use its peremptory challenges to remove from the jury, on a case-specific basis, prospective jurors of the same race as the defendant.  Because I find the Court\'s rejection of this holding both ill-considered and unjustifiable under established principles of equal protection, I dissent.</p>\n<p>In <em>Swain,</em> this Court carefully distinguished two possible scenarios involving the State\'s use of its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from juries in criminal cases.  In Part III of the majority opinion, the <em>Swain</em> Court concluded that the first of these scenarios, namely, the exclusion of blacks</p>\n<p>"for reasons wholly unrelated to the outcome of the particular case on trial . . . to deny the Negro the same right and opportunity to participate in the administration of justice enjoyed by the white population,"</p>\n<p>380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#224">380 U.

S. 222</a></span>-228.  The Court felt that the important and historic purposes of the peremptory challenge were not furthered by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 476 U.

S. 223</a></span> (emphasis added).  Nevertheless, the Court ultimately held that</p>\n<p>"the record in this case is not sufficient to demonstrate that th[is] rule has been violated. . . .  Petitioner has the burden of proof, and he has failed to carry it."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#224">380 U.

Three Justices dissented, arguing that the petitioner\'s evidentiary burden was satisfied by testimony that no black had ever served on a petit jury in the relevant county.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#228">380 U. S. 228</a></span>-247 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren, C.J., and Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Significantly, the <em>Swain</em> Court reached a very different conclusion with respect to the second kind of peremptory challenge scenario.  In Part II of its opinion, the Court held that the State\'s use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from a particular jury based on the assumption or belief that they would be more likely to favor a black defendant does not violate equal protection.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#209">380 U.

JUSTICE WHITE, writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<p>"While challenges for cause permit rejection of jurors on a narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable basis of partiality, the peremptory permits rejection for a <em>real or imagined</em> partiality that is less easily designated or demonstrable.  <em>Hayes v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/120/68/case.html">120 U. S. 68</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/120/68/case.html#70">120 U. S. 70</a></span> [1887].

It is no less frequently exercised on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 476 U. S. 136</a></p><p> summoned for jury duty.  For the question a prosecutor or defense counsel must decide is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is in fact partial, but whether one from a different group is less likely to be. . . .  Hence veniremen are not always judged solely as individuals for the purpose of exercising peremptory challenges.  Rather, they are challenged in light of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, <em>which may include their group affiliations,</em> in the context of the case to be tried.  With these considerations in mind, we cannot hold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial of equal protection of the laws.  In the quest for an impartial and qualified jury, Negro and white, Protestant and Catholic, are alike subject to being challenged without cause.  To subject the prosecutor\'s challenge in any particular case to the demands and traditional standards of the Equal Protection Clause would entail a radical change in the nature and operation of the challenge.  The challenge, <em>pro tanto,</em> would no longer be peremptory. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#220">380 U. S. 220</a></span>-222 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  At the beginning of Part III of the opinion, the <em>Swain</em> Court reiterated:</p>\n<p>"We have decided that it is permissible to insulate from inquiry the removal of Negroes from a particular jury on the assumption that the prosecutor is acting on acceptable considerations related to the case he is trying, <em>the particular defendant involved,</em> and the particular crime charged."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#223">380 U. S. 223</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Even the <em>Swain</em> dissenters did not take issue with the majority\'s position that the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the State from using its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks based on the assumption or belief that they would be partial to a black defendant.  The dissenters emphasized that their view concerning the evidentiary burden facing a defendant who alleges an equal protection claim based on the State\'s use of peremptory challenges</p>\n<p>"would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 476 U. S. 137</a></p><p> [not] mean that where systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service has not been shown, a prosecutor\'s motives are subject to question or judicial inquiry when he excludes Negroes or any other group from sitting on a jury <em>in a particular case.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#245">380 U. S. 245</a></span> (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Court today asserts, however, that</p>\n<p>"the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely . . . on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\'s case against a black defendant."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#89">476 U. S. 89</a></span>.  Later, in discussing the State\'s need to establish a nondiscriminatory basis for striking blacks from the jury, the Court states that</p>\n<p>"the prosecutor may not rebut the defendant\'s <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination by stating merely that he challenged jurors of the defendant\'s race on the assumption -- or his intuitive judgment -- that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#97">476 U. S. 97</a></span>.  Neither of these statements has anything to do with the "evidentiary burden" necessary to establish an equal protection claim in this context, and both statements are directly contrary to the view of the Equal Protection Clause shared by the majority and the dissenters in <em>Swain.</em>  Yet the Court in the instant case offers absolutely no analysis in support of its decision to overrule <em>Swain</em> in this regard, and in fact does not discuss Part II of the <em>Swain</em> opinion at all.</p>\n<p>I cannot subscribe to the Court\'s unprecedented use of the Equal Protection Clause to restrict the historic scope of the peremptory challenge, which has been described as "a necessary part of trial by jury."  <em>Swain,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/202/case.html#219">380 U. S. 219</a></span>.  In my view, there is simply nothing "unequal" about the State\'s using its peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the jury in cases involving black defendants, so long as such challenges are also used to exclude whites in cases involving white defendants, Hispanics in cases involving Hispanic defendants, Asians in cases involving Asian defendants, and so </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 476 U. S. 138</a></p><p> on.  This case-specific use of peremptory challenges by the State does not single out blacks, or members of any other race for that matter, for discriminatory treatment. [<a href="#F5/1" name="T5/1">Footnote 5/1</a>]  Such use of peremptories is, at best, based upon seat-of-the-pants instincts, which are undoubtedly crudely stereotypical and may in many cases be hopelessly mistaken.  But as long as they are applied across-the-board to jurors of all races and nationalities, I do not see -- and the Court most certainly has not explained -- how their use violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>Nor does such use of peremptory challenges by the State infringe upon any other constitutional interests.  The Court does not suggest that exclusion of blacks from the jury through the State\'s use of peremptory challenges results in a violation of either the fair-cross-section or impartiality component of the Sixth Amendment.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#84">476 U. S. 84</a></span>-85, n. 4.  And because the case-specific use of peremptory challenges by the State does not deny blacks the right to serve as jurors in cases involving nonblack defendants, it harms neither the excluded jurors nor the remainder of the community.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/case.html#87">476 U. S. 87</a></span>-88.</p>\n<p>The use of group affiliations, such as age, race, or occupation, as a "proxy" for potential juror partiality, based on the assumption or belief that members of one group are more likely to favor defendants who belong to the same group, has long been accepted as a legitimate basis for the State\'s exercise of peremptory challenges.  <em>See Swain, supra; United States v. Leslie,</em> 783 F.2d 541 (CA5 1986) (en banc); <em>United States v. Carter,</em> 528 F.2d 844 (CA8 1975), <em>cert. denied,</em> 425 U.S. 961 (1976).  Indeed, given the need for reasonable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 476 U. S. 139</a></p><p> limitations on the time devoted to <em>voir dire,</em> the use of such "proxies" by both the State and the defendant [<a href="#F5/2" name="T5/2">Footnote 5/2</a>] may be extremely useful in eliminating from the jury persons who might be biased in one way or another.  The Court today holds that the State may not use its peremptory challenges to strike black prospective jurors on this basis without violating the Constitution.  But I do not believe there is anything in the Equal Protection Clause, or any other constitutional provision, that justifies such a departure from the substantive holding contained in Part II of <em>Swain.</em>  Petitioner in the instant case failed to make a sufficient showing to overcome the presumption announced in <em>Swain</em> that the State\'s use of peremptory challenges was related to the context of the case.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5/1" name="F5/1">Footnote 5/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I note that the Court does not rely on the argument that, because there are fewer "minorities" in a given population than there are "majorities," the equal use of peremptory challenges against members of "majority" and "minority" racial groups has an unequal impact.  The flaws in this argument are demonstrated in Judge Garwood\'s thoughtful opinion for the en banc Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Leslie,</em> 783 F.2d 541, 558-561 (1986).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5/2" name="F5/2">Footnote 5/2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. DiMatteo,</em> 12 Mass.App. 547, 427 N.E.2d 754 (1981) (under State Constitution, trial judge properly rejected white defendant\'s attempted peremptory challenge of black prospective juror).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
