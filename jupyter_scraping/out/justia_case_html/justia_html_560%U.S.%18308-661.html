The teams, each of which owns its own name, colors, logo, trademarks, and related intellectual property, formed respondent National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license, and market that property.  At first, NFLP granted nonexclusive licenses to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell team-labeled apparel.  In December 2000, however, the teams authorized NFLP to grant exclusive licenses.  NFLP granted an exclusive license to respondent Reebok International Ltd. to produce and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams.  When petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s license was not renewed, it filed this action alleging that the agreements between respondents violated the Sherman Act, \xc2\xa71 of which makes \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very contract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade\xe2\x80\x9d illegal.  Respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s meaning because the NFL and its teams are, in antitrust law jargon, a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged.  The District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.

Section 1 \xe2\x80\x9ctreat[s] concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 768, because, unlike independent action, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it \xe2\x80\x9cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 768\xe2\x80\x93769.  And because concerted action is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct.  That creates less risk of deterring a firm\xe2\x80\x99s necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete agreements.  An arrangement must therefore embody concerted action in order to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or, conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71.

The Court has repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated \xc2\xa71 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sealy, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/350/index.html">388 U. S. 350</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93356.  Conversely, the Court has found that although the entities may be \xe2\x80\x9cseparate\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of incorporation or formal title, if they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power, an agreement between them does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or, conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Copperweld,</em> 467 U.

The inquiry is whether the agreement in question joins together \xe2\x80\x9cseparate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Copperweld,</em> 467 U. S., at 768, such that it \xe2\x80\x9cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 769, and therefore of diversity of entrepreneurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition.  If it does, then there is concerted action covered by \xc2\xa71, and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore illegal.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.  Each of them is a substantial, independently owned, independently managed business, whose \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral corporate actions are guided or determined\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cseparate corporate consciousnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d and whose \xe2\x80\x9cobjectives are\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9ccommon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 771.  They compete with one another, not only on the playing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts, and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Pro Football, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/231/index.html">518 U. S. 231</a>, 249.  Directly relevant here, the teams are potentially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.  When teams license such property, they are not pursuing the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon interests of the whole\xe2\x80\x9d league, but, instead, the interests of each \xe2\x80\x9ccorporation itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 770.  It is not dispositive, as respondents argue, that, by forming NFLP, they have formed a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands through a single outlet.  Although the NFL respondents may be similar<em> </em>in some sense to a single enterprise, they are not similar in the relevant functional sense.  While teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned.  Nor does it matter that the teams may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other forms of entertainment.  Although decisions made by NFLP are not as easily classified as concerted activity, the NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s decisions about licensing the teams\xe2\x80\x99 separately owned intellectual property are concerted activity and thus covered by \xc2\xa71 for the same reason that decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by \xc2\xa71.  In making the relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is \xe2\x80\x9can instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of the teams.  <em>Sealy, </em>388 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93354.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law.  The fact that the NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate to produce games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions.  Because some of these restraints on competition are necessary to produce the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s product, the Rule of Reason generally should apply, and teams\xe2\x80\x99 cooperation is likely to be permissible.  And depending upon the activity in question, the Rule of Reason can at times be applied without detailed analysis.  But the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activity covered for \xc2\xa71 purposes.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  The question whether an arrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is different from and antecedent to the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade.  This case raises that antecedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the National Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity that they formed to manage their intellectual property.  We conclude that the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s licensing activities constitute concerted action that is not categorically beyond the coverage of \xc2\xa71.  The legality of that concerted action must be judged under the Rule of Reason.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorporated association that now includes 32 separately owned professional football teams.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Each team has its own name, colors, and logo, and owns related intellectual property.  Like each of the other teams in the league, the New Orleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, for example, have their own distinctive names, colors, and marks that are well known to millions of sports fans.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 1963, the teams made their own arrangements for licensing their intellectual property and marketing trademarked items such as caps and jerseys.  In 1963, the teams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license, and market their intellectual property.  Most, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by NFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally among the teams.  However, the teams are able to and have at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive licenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manufacture and sell apparel bearing team insignias.  Petitioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees.  In December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to grant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok International Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams.  It thereafter declined to renew American Needle\xe2\x80\x99s nonexclusive license.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0American Needle filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the NFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  In their answer to the complaint, the defendants averred that the teams, NFL, and NFLP were incapable of conspiring within the meaning of \xc2\xa71 \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect to the conduct challenged.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 99.  After limited discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, with regard to the facet of their operations respecting exploitation of intellectual property rights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of antitrust law, acting as a single entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Needle, Inc.</em> v. <em>New Orleans La. Saints</em>, 496 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 941, 943 (2007).  The court concluded \xe2\x80\x9cthat in that facet of their operations they have so integrated their operations that they should be deemed a single entity rather than joint ventures cooperating for a common purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  The panel observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin some contexts, a league seems more aptly described as a single entity immune from antitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a joint venture between independently owned teams that is subject to review under \xc2\xa71.\xe2\x80\x9d  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, 736, 741 (2008).  Relying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry to the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams\xe2\x80\x99 intellectual property.  The panel agreed with petitioner that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen making a single-entity determination, courts must examine whether the conduct in question deprives the marketplace of the independent sources of economic control that competition assumes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 742.  The court, however, discounted the significance of potential competition among the teams regarding the use of their intellectual property because the teams \xe2\x80\x9ccan function only as one source of economic power when collectively producing NFL football.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 743.  The court noted that football itself can only be carried out jointly.  See <em>ibid.  </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cAsserting that a single football team could produce a football game \xe2\x80\xa6 is a Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cNFL teams share a vital economic interest in collectively promoting NFL football \xe2\x80\xa6 [to] compet[e] with other forms of entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cIt thus follows,\xe2\x80\x9d the court found, \xe2\x80\x9cthat only one source of economic power controls the promotion of NFL football,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit makes little sense to assert that each individual team has the authority, if not the responsibility, to promote the jointly produced NFL football.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Recognizing that NFL teams have \xe2\x80\x9clicense[d] their intellectual property collectively\xe2\x80\x9d since 1963, the court held that \xc2\xa71 did not apply.  <em>Id.</em>, at 744.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  557 U.

To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence\xe2\x80\x9d).

Section 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains trade.  Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and independent action, but only if that action \xe2\x80\x9cmonopolize[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 15 U.

Monopoly power may be equally harmful whether it is the product of joint action or individual action. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress used this distinction between concerted and independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and compensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competition through ordinary business operations.  The distinction also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal business decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in \xc2\xa71 Congress \xe2\x80\x9ctreated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 768.  This is so because unlike independent action, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it \xe2\x80\x9cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 768\xe2\x80\x93769.  And because concerted action is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct.  As a result, there is less risk of deterring a firm\xe2\x80\x99s necessary conduct; courts need only examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may be remedied simply through prohibition.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb61464c, at 206.  Concerted activity is thus \xe2\x80\x9cjudged more sternly than unilateral activity under \xc2\xa72,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 768.  For these reasons, \xc2\xa71 prohibits any concerted action \xe2\x80\x9cin restraint of trade or commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the action does not \xe2\x80\x9cthreate[n] monopolization,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid</em>.  And therefore, an arrangement must embody concerted action in order to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have long held that concerted action under \xc2\xa71 does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities.

We have similarly looked past the form of a legally \xe2\x80\x9csingle entity\xe2\x80\x9d when competitors were part of professional organizations[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] or trade groups.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Conversely, there is not necessarily concerted action simply because more than one legally distinct entity is involved.  Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known as the \xe2\x80\x9cintraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d we once treated cooperation between legally separate entities as necessarily covered by \xc2\xa71, we now embark on a more functional analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The roots of this functional analysis can be found in the very decision that established the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Yellow Cab Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/218/index.html">332 U. S. 218</a> (1947), we observed that \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate interrelationships \xe2\x80\xa6 are not determinitive of the applicability of the Sherman Act\xe2\x80\x9d because the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis aimed at substance rather than form.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 227.  We nonetheless held that cooperation between legally separate entities was necessarily covered by \xc2\xa71 because an unreasonable restraint of trade \xe2\x80\x9cmay result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co.</em> v. <em>Joseph E.

Applying a specific immunity provision for agricultural cooperatives, we held that the three cooperatives were \xe2\x80\x9cin practical effect\xe2\x80\x9d one \xe2\x80\x9corganization,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the controlling farmers \xe2\x80\x9chave formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 29.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo hold otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to impose grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of <em>de minimis</em> meaning and effect\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as \xe2\x80\x9cuse of separate corporations had [no] economic significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat.

S. 86</a> (1975), a large bank, Citizens and Southern (C&amp;S), formed a holding company that operated <em>de facto</em> suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area through ownership of the maximum amount of stock in each local branch that was allowed by law, \xe2\x80\x9cownership of much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C&amp;S, use by the suburban banks of the C&amp;S logogram and all of C&amp;S\xe2\x80\x99s banking services, and close C&amp;S oversight of the operation and governance of the suburban banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 89 (footnote omitted).  The Government challenged the cooperation between the banks.  In our analysis, we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98corporate interrelationships \xe2\x80\xa6 are not determinative,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 116, \xe2\x80\x9clooked to economic substance,\xe2\x80\x9d and observed that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the sponsored banks were not set up to be competitors, \xc2\xa71 did not compel them to compete.\xe2\x80\x9d  Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb61463, at 200\xe2\x80\x93201; see also <em>Citizens &amp; Southern</em>, 422 U.

Considering it \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly plain that an internal agreement to implement a single, unitary firm\xe2\x80\x99s policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that \xc2\xa71 was designed to police,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 769, we held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary \xe2\x80\x9care incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 777.  We explained that although a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are \xe2\x80\x9cseparate\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of incorporation or formal title, they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power.

S., at 773, n.\xc2\xa021.  This inquiry is sometimes described as asking whether the alleged conspirators are a single entity.  That is perhaps a misdescription, however, because the question is not whether the defendant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is the question whether the parties involved \xe2\x80\x9cseem\xe2\x80\x9d like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense.  The key is whether the alleged \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, or conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d is concerted action\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether it joins together separate decisionmakers.  The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d amongst \xe2\x80\x9cseparate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 769, such that the agreement \xe2\x80\x9cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and therefore of \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity of entrepreneurial interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fraser</em> v. <em>Major League Soccer, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.,</em> 284 F.\xc2\xa03d 47, 57 (CA1 2002) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J.), and thus of actual or potential competition, see <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>San Diego Assn. of Realtors</em>, 322 F.\xc2\xa03d 1133, 1148\xe2\x80\x931149 (CA9 2003) (Kozinski, J.); <em>Rothery Storage &amp; Van Co.</em> v. <em>Atlas Van Line, Inc.</em>, 792 F.\xc2\xa02d 210, 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (CADC 1986) (Bork, J.); see also Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb61462b, at 193\xe2\x80\x93194 (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9ccentral evil addressed by Sherman Act \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9celimin[ation of] competition that would otherwise exist\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, while the president and a vice president of a firm could (and regularly do) act in combination, their joint action generally is not the sort of \xe2\x80\x9ccombination\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa71 is intended to cover.  Such agreements might be described as \xe2\x80\x9creally unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a single enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 767.  Nor, for this reason, does \xc2\xa71 cover \xe2\x80\x9cinternally coordinated conduct of a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 770, because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] division within a corporate structure pursues the common interests of the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and therefore \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination between a corporation and its division does not represent a sudden joining of two independent sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 770\xe2\x80\x93771.  Nor, for the same reasons, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary\xe2\x80\x9d covered.  See <em>id.</em>, at 771.  They \xe2\x80\x9chave a complete unity of interest\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith or without a formal \xe2\x80\x98agreement,\xe2\x80\x99 the subsidiary acts for the benefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the inquiry is one of competitive reality, it is not determinative that two parties to an alleged \xc2\xa71 violation are legally distinct entities.  Nor, however, is it determinative that two legally distinct entities have organized themselves under a single umbrella or into a structured joint venture.  The question is whether the agreement joins together \xe2\x80\x9cindependent centers of decisionmaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 769.  If it does, the entities are capable of conspiring under \xc2\xa71, and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and therefore illegal one.  </p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.  Each of the teams is a substantial, independently owned, and independently managed business.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]heir general corporate actions are guided or determined\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cseparate corporate consciousnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]heir objectives are\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9ccommon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U.

The teams compete with one another, not only on the playing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel.  See <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Pro Football, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/231/index.html">518 U.

S., at 99.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Directly relevant to this case, the teams compete in the market for intellectual property.  To a firm making hats, the Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing suppliers of valuable trademarks.  When each NFL team licenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon interests of the whole\xe2\x80\x9d league but is instead pursuing interests of each \xe2\x80\x9ccorporation itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 770; teams are acting as \xe2\x80\x9cseparate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,\xe2\x80\x9d and each team therefore is a potential \xe2\x80\x9cindependent cente[r] of decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 769.  Decisions by NFL teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[e] the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and therefore of actual or potential competition.  See <em>NCAA</em>, 468 U. S., at 109, n.\xc2\xa039 (observing a possible \xc2\xa71 violation if two separately owned companies sold their separate products through a \xe2\x80\x9csingle selling agent\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb61478a, at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, the most significant competitive threats arise when joint venture participants are actual or potential competitors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In defense, respondents argue that by forming NFLP, they have formed a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands through a single outlet.  But it is not dispositive that the teams have organized and own a legally separate entity that centralizes the management of their intellectual property.  An ongoing \xc2\xa71 violation cannot evade \xc2\xa71 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a name and label.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps every agreement and combination in restraint of trade could be so labeled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Timken Roller Bearing Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/593/index.html">341 U. S. 593</a>, 598 (1951).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NFL respondents may be similar<em> </em>in some sense to a single enterprise that owns several pieces of intellectual property and licenses them jointly, but they are not similar in the relevant functional sense.  Although NFL teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned.  See generally Hovenkamp, Exclusive Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 1995 Colum. Bus. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 52\xe2\x80\x9361 (1995); Shishido, Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Duties in the Operation of a Joint Venture, 39 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J. 63, 69\xe2\x80\x9381 (1987).

S., at 770\xe2\x80\x93771; brackets in original).  But illegal restraints often are in the common interests of the parties to the restraint, at the expense of those who are not parties.  It is true, as respondents describe, that they have for some time marketed their trademarks jointly.  But a history of concerted activity does not immunize conduct from \xc2\xa71 scrutiny.  \xe2\x80\x9cAbsence of actual competition may simply be a manifestation of the anticompetitive agreement itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freeman</em>, 322 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1149.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals held, they constitute a single entity because without their cooperation, there would be no NFL football.  It is true that \xe2\x80\x9cthe clubs that make up a professional sports league are not completely independent economic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation for economic survival.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em>, 518 U. S., at 248.  But the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The justification for cooperation is not relevant to whether that cooperation is concerted or independent action.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  A \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71, that is necessary or useful to a joint venture is still a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract, combination \xe2\x80\xa6 or conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d if it \xe2\x80\x9cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Copperweld</em>, 467 U. S., at 769.  See <em>NCAA,</em> 468 U. S., at 113 (\xe2\x80\x9c[J]oint ventures have no immunity from antitrust laws\xe2\x80\x9d).  Any joint venture involves multiple sources of economic power cooperating to produce a product.  And for many such ventures, the participation of others is necessary.  But that does not mean that necessity of cooperation transforms concerted action into independent action; a nut and a bolt can only operate together, but an agreement between nut and bolt manufacturers is still subject to \xc2\xa71 analysis.  Nor does it mean that once a group of firms agree to produce a joint product, cooperation amongst those firms must be treated as independent conduct.  The mere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense does not mean that they are immune.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute concerted activity covered by \xc2\xa71 is closer than whether decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by \xc2\xa71.  This is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation with its own management and because the record indicates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are shared by the teams on an equal basis.  Nevertheless we think it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams\xe2\x80\x99 conduct is covered by \xc2\xa71, NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s actions also are subject to \xc2\xa71, at least with regards to its marketing of property owned by the separate teams.  NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s licensing decisions are made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of them actually owns its share of the jointly managed assets.  Cf. <em>Sealy</em>, 388 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93354.  Apart from their agreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, including their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to prevent each of the teams from making its own market decisions relating to purchases of apparel and headwear, to the sale of such items, and to the granting of licenses to use its trademarks.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We generally treat agreements within a single firm as independent action on the presumption that the components of the firm will act to maximize the firm\xe2\x80\x99s profits.   But in rare cases, that presumption does not hold.  Agreements made within a firm can constitute concerted action covered by \xc2\xa71 when the parties to the agreement act on interests separate from those of the firm itself,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and the intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for ongoing concerted action.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Topco Associates, Inc.</em>, 405 U. S., at 609; <em>Sealy, </em>388 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For that reason, decisions by the NFLP regarding the teams\xe2\x80\x99 separately owned intellectual property constitute concerted action.  Thirty-two teams operating independently through the vehicle of the NFLP are not like the components of a single firm that act to maximize the firm\xe2\x80\x99s profits.  The teams remain separately controlled, potential competitors with economic interests that are distinct from NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s financial well-being.  See generally Hovenkamp, 1995 Colum. Bus. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 52\xe2\x80\x9361.  Unlike typical decisions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions effectively require the assent of more than a mere majority of shareholders.  And each team\xe2\x80\x99s decision reflects not only an interest in NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s profits but also an interest in the team\xe2\x80\x99s individual profits.  See generally Shusido<em>,</em> 39 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J., at 69\xe2\x80\x9371.  The 32 teams capture individual economic benefits separate and apart from NFLP profits as a result of the decisions they make for the NFLP.  NFLP\xe2\x80\x99s decisions thus affect each team\xe2\x80\x99s profits from licensing its own intellectual property.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the business interests of\xe2\x80\x9d the teams \xe2\x80\x9cwill <em>often</em> coincide with those of the\xe2\x80\x9d NFLP \xe2\x80\x9cas an entity in itself, that commonality of interest exists in every cartel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>NFL</em>, 726 F.\xc2\xa02d 1381, 1389 (CA9 1984) (emphasis added).  In making the relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is therefore \xe2\x80\x9can instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d of the teams.  <em>Sealy, </em>388 U.

S., at 252 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions.  But the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted activity under the Sherman Act that is subject to \xc2\xa71 analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When \xe2\x80\x9crestraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>per se</em> rules of illegality are inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged according to the flexible Rule of Reason.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>NCAA</em>, 468 U.
