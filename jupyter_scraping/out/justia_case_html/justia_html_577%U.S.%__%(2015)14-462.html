It specified that the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable if the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d made class-arbitration waivers unenforceable.  The agreement also declared that the arbitration clause was governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.  At the time that respondents, California residents, entered into that agreement with DIRECTV, California law made class-arbitration waivers unenforceable, see <i>Discover Bank</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i>, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100.  This Court subsequently held in <i>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC</i> v. <i>Concepcion</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333\n, however, that California\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Discover Bank</i> rule was pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act,\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">When respondents sued petitioner, the trial court deniedDIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s request to order the matter to arbitration, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The court thought that California law would render class-arbitration waivers unenforceable, so it held the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable under the agreement.  The fact that the Federal Arbitration Act pre-empted that California law did not change the result, the court said, because the parties were free to refer in the contract to California law as it would have been absent federal pre-emption.  The court reasoned that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d was both a specific provision that should govern more general provisions and an ambiguous provision that should be construed against the drafter.  Therefore, the court held, the parties had in fact included California law as it would have been without federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because the California Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act, that court must enforce the arbitration agreement.

The state court interpreted the contract to mean that the parties did so, and the interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a matter of state law to which this Court defers, <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</i> v. <i>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 468\n.  The issue here is not whether the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a correct statement of California law but whether it is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The California court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not place arbitration contracts \xe2\x80\x9con equal footing with all other contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cardegna</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440\n, because California courts would not interpret contracts other than arbitration contracts the same way.  Several considerations lead to this conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">First, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d is not ambiguous and takes its ordinary meaning: valid state law.  Second, California case law\xe2\x80\x94that under \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral contract principles,\xe2\x80\x9d references to California law incorporate the California Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s power to change the law retroactively, <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 57 Cal. 4th 64, 69\xe2\x80\x9370, 302 P.\xc2\xa03d 598, 601\xe2\x80\x93602\xe2\x80\x94clarifies any doubt about how to interpret it.  Third, because the court nowhere suggests that California courts would reach the same interpretation in any other context, its conclusion appears to reflect the subject matter, rather than a general principle that would include state statutes invalidated by other federal law.  Fourth, the language the court uses to frame the issue focuses only on arbitration.  Fifth, the view that state law retains independent force after being authoritatively invalidated is one courts are unlikely to apply in other contexts.  Sixth, none of the principles of contract interpretation relied on by the California court suggests that other California courts would reach the same interpretation elsewhere.  The court applied the canon that contracts are construed against the drafter, but the lack of any similar case interpreting similar language to include invalid laws indicates that the antidrafter canon would not lead California courts to reach a similar conclusion in cases not involving arbitration.

They seek damages for early termination fees that they believe violate California law.  After various proceedings not here relevant, DIRECTV, pointing to the arbitration provision, asked the court to send the matter to arbitration.  The state trial court denied that request, and DIRECTVappealed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The California Court of Appeal thought that the critical legal question concerned the meaning of the contractual phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state,\xe2\x80\x9d in this case<i> </i>the law of California.  Does the law of California make the contract\xe2\x80\x99s class-arbitration waiver unenforceable?  If so, as the contract provides, the entire arbitration provision is unenforceable.  Or does California law permit the parties to agree to waive the right to proceed as a class in arbitration?  If so, the arbitration provision is enforceable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At one point, the law of California would have made the contract\xe2\x80\x99s class-arbitration waiver unenforceable.  In 2005, the California Supreme Court held in <i>Discover Bank</i> v. <i>Superior Court, </i>36 Cal. 4th 148, 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100, 1110, that a \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver\xe2\x80\x9d of class arbitration in a \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer contract of adhesion\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cpredictably involve[s] small amounts of damages\xe2\x80\x9d and meets certain other criteria not contested here is \xe2\x80\x9cunconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>DirecTV, Inc.</i>, 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1446\xe2\x80\x931447, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 813, 815\xe2\x80\x93816 (2006) (holding a class-action waiver similar to the one at issue here unenforceable pursuant to <i>Discover Bank</i>); see also Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71751, 1781(a) (West 2009) (invalidating class-action waivers for claims brought under that statute).  But in 2011, this Court held that California\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Discover Bank </i>rule \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d embodied in the Federal Arbitration Act.  <i>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC</i> v. <i>Concepcion</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333,\n352 (2011)\n (quoting <i>Hines</i> v. <i>Davidowitz</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52,\n67 (1941)\n); see <i>Sanchez</i> v. <i>Valencia Holding Co., LLC</i>, 61 Cal. 4th 899, 923\xe2\x80\x93924, 353 P. 3d 741, 757 (2015) (holding that <i>Concepcion </i>applies to the Consumers Legal Remedies Act to the extent that it would have the same effect as <i>Discover Bank</i>).  The Fed-eral Arbitration Act therefore pre-empts and invalidates that rule.  563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352; see U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The California Court of Appeal subsequently held in this case that, despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Concepcion</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of California would find the class action waiver unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  225 Cal. App. 4th 338, 342, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190, 194 (2014).  The court noted that <i>Discover Bank</i> had held agreements to dispense with class-arbitration procedures unenforceable under circumstances such as these.  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 341, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 194.  It conceded that this Court in <i>Concepcion </i>had held that the Federal Arbitration Act invalidated California\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>rule.  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 341, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 194.  But it then concluded that this latter circumstance did not change the result\xe2\x80\x94that the \xe2\x80\x9cclass action waiver is unenforceable under California law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 347, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 198.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeal referred to two sections of California\xe2\x80\x99s Consumers Legal Remedies Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71751, 1781(a), rather than <i>Discover Bank</i> itself.  See 225 Cal. App. 4th, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.  Section 1751 renders invalid any waiver of the right under \xc2\xa71781(a) to bring a class action for violations of that Act.  The Court of Appeal thought that applying \xe2\x80\x9cstate law alone\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, those two sections) would render unenforceable the class-arbitration waiver in \xc2\xa79 of the contract.  <i>Id.</i>, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.  But it nonetheless recognized that if it applied federal law \xe2\x80\x9cthen the class action waiver is enforceable and any state law to the contrary is preempted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  As far as those sections apply to class-arbitration waivers, they embody the <i>Discover Bank</i> rule.  The California Supreme Court has recognized as much, see <i>Sanchez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 923\xe2\x80\x93924, 353 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 757, and no party argues to the contrary.  See Supp. Brief for Respondents 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ruling in <i>Sanchez</i> tracks respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position precisely\xe2\x80\x9d).  We shall consequently refer to the here-relevant rule as the <i>Discover Bank</i> rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court reasoned that just as the parties were free in their contract to refer to the laws of different States or different nations, so too were they free to refer to California law as it would have been without this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding invalidating the <i>Discover Bank </i>rule.  The court thought that the parties in their contract had done just that.  And it set forth two reasons for believing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, \xc2\xa710 of the contract, stating that the Federal Arbitration Act governs \xc2\xa79 (the arbitration provision), is a <i>general</i> provision.  But the provision voiding arbitration if the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d would find the class-arbitration waiver unenforceable is a <i>specific</i> provision.  The court believed that the specific provision \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is paramount to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and must govern the general.  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195 (quoting <i>Prouty</i> v. <i>Gores Technology Group</i>, 121 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1235, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 178, 185\xe2\x80\x93186 (2004); brackets omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the court said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  255 Cal. App. 4th, at 345, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 196 (quoting <i>Mastrobuono</i> v. <i>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52,\n62 (1995)\n).  DIRECTV had drafted the language; to void the arbitration provision was against its interest.  Hence the arbitration provision was void.  The Court of Appeal consequently affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s motion to enforce the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The California Supreme Court denied discretionary review.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a.  DIRECTV then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, noting that the Ninth Circuit had reached the opposite conclusion on precisely the same interpretive question decided by the California Court of Appeal.  <i>Murphy</i> v. <i>DirecTV, Inc.</i>, 724 F.\xc2\xa03d 1218, 1226\xe2\x80\x931228 (2013).  We granted the petition.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">No one denies that lower courts must follow this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Concepcion.</i>  The fact that <i>Concepcion </i>was a closely divided case, resulting in a decision from which four Justices dissented, has no bearing on that undisputed obligation.  Lower court judges are certainly free to note their disagreement with a decision of this Court.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cSupremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Howlett</i> v. <i>Rose</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356,\n371 (1990)\n; cf. <i>Khan</i> v. <i>State Oil Co.</i>, 93 F.\xc2\xa03d 1358, 1363\xe2\x80\x931364 (CA7 1996), vacated,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 3 (1997)\n.  The Federal Arbitration Act is a law of the United States, and <i>Concepcion </i>is an authoritative interpretation of that Act.  Consequently, the judges of every State must follow it.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Judges in every State shall be bound\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cthe Laws of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While all accept this elementary point of law, that point does not resolve the issue in this case.  As the Court of Appeal noted, the Federal Arbitration Act allows parties to an arbitration contract considerable latitude to choose what law governs some or all of its provisions, including the law governing enforceability of a class-arbitration waiver.  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 194.  In principle, they might choose to have portions of their contract governed by the law of Tibet, the law of pre-revolutionary Russia, or (as is relevant here) the law of California including the <i>Discover Bank </i>rule and irrespective of that rule\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation in <i>Concepcion</i>.  The Court of Appeal decided that, as a matter of contract law, the parties did mean the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to this last possibility.  Since the interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a matter of state law to which we defer, <i>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</i> v. <i>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 468,\n474 (1989)\n<i>, </i>we must decide not whether its decision is a correct statement of California law but whether (assuming it is) that state law is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although we may doubt that the Court of Appeal has correctly interpreted California law, we recognize that California courts are the ultimate authority on that law.  While recognizing this, we must decide whether the decision of the California court places arbitration contracts \xe2\x80\x9con equal footing with all other contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cardegna</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440,\n443 (2006)\n.  And in doing so, we must examine whether the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s decision in fact rests upon \xe2\x80\x9cgrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  That is to say, we look not to grounds that the California court might have offered but rather to those it did in fact offer.  Neither this approach nor our result \xe2\x80\x9csteps beyond <i>Concepcion</i>\xe2\x80\x9d or any other aspect of federal arbitration law.  See <i>post,</i> at 9 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (hereinafter the dissent).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We recognize, as the dissent points out, <i>post,</i> at 4, that when DIRECTV drafted the contract, the parties likely believed that the words \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d included California law that then made class-arbitration waivers unenforceable.  But that does not answer the legal question before us.  That is because this Court subsequently held in <i>Concepcion</i> that the <i>Discover Bank</i> rule was invalid.  Thus the underlying question of contract law at the time the Court of Appeal made its decision was whether the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d included <i>invalid</i> California law.  We must now decide whether answering <i>that</i> question in the affirmative is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.  After examining the grounds upon which the Court of Appeal rested its decision, we conclude that California courts would not interpret contracts other than arbitration contracts the same way.  Rather, several considerations lead us to conclude that the court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of this arbitration contract is unique, restricted to that field.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, we do not believe that the relevant contract language is ambiguous.  The contract says that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable, then this entire Section 9 [the arbitration section] is unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 129.  Absent any indication in the contract that this language is meant to refer to <i>invalid </i>state law, it presumably takes its ordinary meaning: <i>valid </i>state law.  Indeed, neither the parties nor the dissent refer us to any contract case from California or from any other State that in-terprets similar language to refer to state laws authoritatively held to be invalid.  While we recognize that the dissent believes this phrase to be \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 7, 9, or \xe2\x80\x9canomalous,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 10, we cannot agree with that characterization.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, California case law itself clarifies any doubt about how to interpret the language.  The California Supreme Court has held that under \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral contract principles,\xe2\x80\x9d references to California law incorporate the California Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s power to change the law retroactively.  See <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 57 Cal. 4th 64, 69\xe2\x80\x9370, 302 P.\xc2\xa03d 598, 601\xe2\x80\x93602 (2013) (holding that plea agreements, which are governed by general contract principles, are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to incorporate and contemplate not only the existing law but the reserve power of the state to amend the law or enact additional laws\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>People</i> v. <i>Gipson</i>, 117 Cal. App. 4th 1065, 1070, 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 478, 481 (2004))).  And judicial construction of a statute ordinarily applies retroactively.  <i>Rivers</i> v. <i>Roadway Express, Inc.</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298\n\xe2\x80\x93313 (1994).  As far as we are aware, the principle of California law announced in <i>Harris</i>, not the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s decision here, would ordinarily govern the scope of phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> Third, nothing in the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning suggests that a California court would reach the same interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d in any context other than arbitration.  The Court of Appeal did not explain why parties might generally intend the words \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass \xe2\x80\x9c<i>invalid</i> law of your state.\xe2\x80\x9d  To the contrary, the contract refers to \xe2\x80\x9cstate law\xe2\x80\x9d that makes the waiver of class arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cunenforceable,\xe2\x80\x9d while an in-valid state law would not make a contractual provision unenforceable.  Assuming\xe2\x80\x94as we must\xe2\x80\x94that the court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is a correct statement as to the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d in this arbitration provision, we can find nothing in that opinion (nor in any other California case) suggesting that California would generally interpret words such as \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d to include state laws held invalid because they conflict with, say, federal labor statutes, federal pension statutes, federal antidiscrimination laws, the Equal Protection Clause, or the like.  Even given our assumption that the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is correct, its conclusion appears to reflect the subject matter at issue here (arbitration), rather than a general principle that would apply to contracts using similar language but involving state statutes invalidated by other federal law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, the language used by the Court of Appeal focused only on arbitration.  The court asked whether \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmean[s] \xe2\x80\x98the law of your state to the extent it is not preempted by the [Federal Arbitration Act],\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect, if any of the [Federal Arbitration Act].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.  Framing the question in such terms, rather than in generally applicable terms, suggests that the Court of Appeal could well have meant that its holding was limited to the specific subject matter of this contract\xe2\x80\x94arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fifth, the Court of Appeal reasoned that invalid state arbitration law, namely the <i>Discover Bank </i>rule, maintained legal force despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Concepcion</i>.  The court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f we apply state law alone .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the class action waiver, then the waiver is unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.  And at the end of its opinion it reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he class action waiver is unenforceable under California law, so the entire arbitration agreement is unenforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 347, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 198.  But those statements do not describe California law.  See <i>Concepcion</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 344, 352; <i>Sanchez</i>, 61 Cal. 4th, at 923\xe2\x80\x93924, 353 P. 3d, at 757.  The view that state law retains independent force even after it has been authoritatively invalidated by this Court is one courts are unlikely to accept as a general matter and to apply in other contexts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> Sixth, there is no other principle invoked by the Court of Appeal that suggests that California courts would reach the same interpretation of the words \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9din other contexts.  The court said that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawof your state\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a specific <i>exception</i>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>general</i> adoption of the [Federal Arbitration Act].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.  But that tells us nothing about how to interpret the words \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d elsewhere.  It does not answer the relevant question: whether those words encompass laws that have been authoritatively held invalid.  Cf. <i>Prouty</i>, 121 Cal. App. 4th, at 1235, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 185\xe2\x80\x93186 (specific words govern only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a general and a particular provision are inconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court added that it would interpret \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d namely DIRECTV.  225 Cal. App. 4th, at 345, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 196 (quoting <i>Mastrobuono</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62).  The dissent adopts a similar argument.  See <i>post,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  But, as we have pointed out, <i>supra,</i> at 8, were the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d ambiguous, surely some court would have construed that term to incorporate state laws invalidated by, for example, federal<i> </i>labor law, federal pension law, or federal civil rights law.  Yet, we have found no such case.  Moreover, the reach of the canon construing contract language against the drafter must have limits, no matter who the drafter was.  The fact that we can find no similar case interpreting the words \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d to include <i>invalid </i>state laws indicates, at the least, that the antidrafter canon would not lead California courts to reach a similar conclusion in similar cases that do not involve arbitration.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Taking these considerations together, we reach a conclusion that, in our view, falls well within the confines of (and goes no further than) present well-established law.  California\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d does not place arbitration contracts \xe2\x80\x9con equal footing with all other contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 443.  For that reason, it does not give \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the federal policy favoring arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Volt Information Sciences</i>, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 476.  Thus, the Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is pre-empted by the Federal Arbitration Act.  See <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,\n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483\n, n.\xc2\xa09 (1987) (noting that the Federal Arbitration Act pre-empts decisions that take their \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence, the California Court of Appeal must \xe2\x80\x9cenforc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the arbitration agreement.\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3504574">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x93462</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">DIRECTV, INC., PETITIONER <i>v.</i> AMY IMBURGIA, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[December 14, 2015]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I remain of the view that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, does not apply to proceedings in state courts.

The form contract in this case contains a Delphic provision stating that \xe2\x80\x9cif the law of your state\xe2\x80\x9d does not permit agreements barring class arbitration, then the entire agreement to arbitrate becomes unenforceable, freeing the aggrieved customer to commence class-based litigation in court.  This Court reads that provision in a manner most protective of the drafting enterprise.  I would read it, as the California court did, to give the customer, not the drafter, the benefit of the doubt.  Acknowledging the precedent so far set by the Court, I would take no further step to disarm consumers, leaving them without effective access to justice.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case began as a putative class action in state court claiming that DIRECTV, by imposing hefty early-termination fees, violated California consumer-protective legislation, including the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa71750 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i> (West 2015)<i>.  </i>App. 58.  DIRECTV did not initially seek to stop the lawsuit and compel bilateral arbitration.  See <i>id., </i>at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  The reason for DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s failure to oppose the litigation is no mystery.  The version of DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s service agreement applicable in this case (the 2007 version) requires consumers to arbitrate all disputes and to forgo class arbitration.  <i>Id., </i>at 128\xe2\x80\x93129.  If the relevant provision stopped there, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent precedent, see <i>American Express Co. </i>v. <i>Italian Colors Restaurant</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013); <i>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC </i>v. <i>Concepcion</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333 (2011)\n, would control, and DIRECTV could have resisted the lawsuit.  But DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s form contract continued:The entire arbitration clause is unenforceable \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the law of your state would find\xe2\x80\x9d unenforceable the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s class-arbitration prohibition.  App. 129.  At the time plaintiff-respondents Imburgia and Greiner commenced their court action, class-arbitration bars like the one in DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s agreement were <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i> unenforceable as unconscionable under the law of California.  See <i>Discover Bank </i>v. <i>Superior Court</i>, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 1100, 1110 (2005).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nearly three years into the litigation, this Court held in <i>Concepcion</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 338\xe2\x80\x93351, that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, preempts state rules that render class-arbitration bans unenforceable.  DIRECTV then moved to halt the long-pending lawsuit and compel bilateral arbitration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  The California Superior Court denied DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s motion, No. BC398295 (Super. Ct. Los Angeles Cty., Cal., Jan. 26, 2012),<i> </i>App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a\xe2\x80\x9320a, and the Califor-nia Court of Appeal affirmed.  The Court of Appeal first observed that, under the California law DIRECTV confronted when it drafted the clause in question, provisions relinquishing the right to proceed under the CLRA on behalf of a class would not be enforced.  225 Cal. App. 4th 338, 342, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190, 194 (2014).  The question dispositive of DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the California court explained, trains on the meaning of the atypical contractual phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of your state\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cdoes it mean \xe2\x80\x98the law of your state to the extent it is not preempted by the FAA,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect, if any, of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 344, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 195.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In resolving this question, the California court emphasized that DIRECTV drafted the service agreement, giving its customers no say in the matter, and reserving to itself the right to modify the agreement unilaterally at any time.  <i>Id.,</i> at 345, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 196.  See also Brief for Respondents 1\xe2\x80\x932.  DIRECTV used the same take-it-or-leave-it contract everywhere it did business.  <i>Ibid</i>.  \xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa0T\xc2\xa0]o protect the party who did not choose the language from an unintended or unfair result,\xe2\x80\x9d the California court applied \xe2\x80\x9cthe common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it.\xe2\x80\x9d  225 Cal.

That rule was particularly appropriate in this case, the court reasoned, for, \xe2\x80\x9cas a practical matter, it seems unlikely that plaintiffs anticipated in 2007 that the Supreme Court would hold in 2011 that the FAA preempts\xe2\x80\x9d state-law protection against compelled class-arbitration waivers.  255 Cal.

As I see it, the California court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d provision is not only reasonable, it is entirely right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Arbitration is a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cconsent, not coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>AnimalFeeds Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662,\n681 (2010)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).

Historically, this Court has respected state-court interpretations of arbitration agreements.  See <i>Mastrobuono</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 60, n. 4; <i>Volt Information Sciences</i>, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 484.  Indeed, in the more than 25 years between <i>Volt Information Sciences </i>and this case, not once has this Court reversed a state-court decision on the ground that the state court misapplied state contract law when it determined the meaning of a term in a particular arbitration agreement.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a dangerous first.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beyond genuine debate, DIRECTV originally meant the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d clause to refer to its customer\xe2\x80\x99s home state law untouched by federal preemption.  As DIRECTV explained in a state-court filing, the clause prevented enforcement of the arbitration agreement in those States, California among them, where the class-arbitration proscription was unenforceable as a matter of state law, while requiring bilateral arbitration in States that did not outlaw purported waivers of class proceedings.  App. 52 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Customer Agreement between DIRECTV and its customers provides that the customer\xe2\x80\x99s home state laws will govern the relationship, and that any disputes will be resolved in individual arbitration <i>if</i> the customer\xe2\x80\x99s home state laws enforce the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">According to DIRECTV, because the class-arbitration ban, post-<i>Concepcion</i>, is enforceable in all States, this case must now be resolved, if at all, in bilateral arbitration.  The Court agrees.  After <i>Concepcion</i>, the Court maintains, it no longer matters whether DIRECTV meant California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chome state laws\xe2\x80\x9d when it drafted the 2007 version of its service agreement.  But <i>Concepcion </i>held only that a State cannot <i>compel</i> a party to engage in class arbitration when the controlling agreement unconditionally prohibits class procedures.  See 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 351 (\xe2\x80\x9cArbitration is a matter of contract, and the FAA requires courts to honor parties\xe2\x80\x99 expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d so parties may consent to class procedures even though such procedures \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be required by state law.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Just as a contract itself may provide for class arbitration, so the parties may <i>choose </i>to be bound by a particular state law, in this case, the CLRA, even if the FAA would otherwise displace that state law.  <i>Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. </i>v. <i>Mattel, Inc.</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 576,\n586 (2008)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he FAA lets parties tailor some, even many, features of arbitration by contract, including .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. procedure and choice of substantive law.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cIn principle,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court acknowledges, parties \xe2\x80\x9cmight choose to have portions of their contract governed by the law of Tibet, [or] the law of pre-revolutionary Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6; see Brief for Petitioner 20 (observing that the FAA would allow parties \xe2\x80\x9cto bind themselves by reference to the rules of a board game\xe2\x80\x9d).  Pre-revolutionary Russian law, but not California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chome state laws\xe2\x80\x9d operative and unquestionably valid in 2007?  Makes little sense to me.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in <i>Concepcion </i>or the FAA nullifies provisions of the CLRA.  They hold sway when parties elect judicial resolution of their disputes, and should similarly control when parties choose that consumer-protective law to govern their arbitration agreements.  See <i>Volt Information Sciences</i>, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 475 (where parties had \xe2\x80\x9cincorporat[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. California rules of arbitration into their agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d they had \xe2\x80\x9cno FAA-guaranteed right to compel arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d on terms inconsistent with those California rules).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Thus, even after <i>Concepcion</i>, one could properly refer to the CLRA\xe2\x80\x99s class-waiver proscription as \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia law.\xe2\x80\x9d  To repeat, the dispositive question in this case is whether the parties intended the \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d provision to mean state law as preempted by federal law, as the Court today reads the provision, or home state law as framed by the California Legislature, without considering the preemptive effect of federal law, as the California court read it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The latter reading is the better one.  DIRECTV had no occasion to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of [its customer\xe2\x80\x99s] state\xe2\x80\x9d had it meant to incorporate state law as preempted by the FAA.  That is, DIRECTV, like virtually every other company with a similar service agreement, could have employed a clause directly conditioning enforceability of the arbitration agreement on the exclusion of class arbitration.  Indeed, DIRECTV has done just that in service agreements both before and after 2007.  App. 121 (the 2004 version provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] Court may sever any portion of [the arbitration agreement] that it finds to be unenforce-able, except for the prohibition on class or representative arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Respondents 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (stating that the June 2015 version of DIRECTV\xe2\x80\x99s agreement provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] court may sever any portion of [the arbitration agreement] that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibition on [class arbitration]\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Had DIRECTV followed this pattern in its 2007 form contract, the arbitration agreement, post-<i>Concepcion</i>, unquestionably would have been enforceable in all States.  In the 2007 version, however, DIRECTV chose a different formulation, one referring to the \xe2\x80\x9claw of [its customer\xe2\x80\x99s] state.\xe2\x80\x9d  I would not translate that term to be synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9cfederal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  If DIRECTV meant to exclude the application of California legislation, it surely chose a bizarre way to accomplish that result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As earlier noted, see <i>supra,</i> at 3, and as the California court appreciated, courts generally construe ambiguous contractual terms against the drafter.  See <i>Mastrobuono</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63 (\xe2\x80\x9cRespondents drafted an ambiguous document, and they cannot now claim the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d).  This \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law rule of contract interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 62, reflects the principle that a party should not be permitted to write an ambiguous term, lock another party into agreeing to that term, and then reap the benefit of the ambiguity once a dispute emerges.  The rule has particular force where, as here, a court is interpreting a \xe2\x80\x9cstandardized contrac[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that was not the product of bilateral bargaining.  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7206, Comment <i>a </i>(1979).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Allowing DIRECTV to reap the benefit of an ambiguity it could have avoided would ignore not just the hugely unequal bargaining power of the parties, but also their reasonable expectations at the time the contract was formed.  See <i>Mastrobuono</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63 (it is particularly appropriate to construe terms against the drafter where the other party had no reason to anticipate or intend the drafter\xe2\x80\x99s preferred result).  See also <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Franklin Mint Corp.</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 243,\n262 (1984)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontract[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are to be read in the light of the conditions and circumstances existing at the time they were entered into, with a view to effecting the objects and purposes of the [parties] thereby contracting.\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Rocca</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>,\n\n223 U.\xc2\xa0S. 317\n\xe2\x80\x93332 (1912); ellipsis in original)).  At the time DIRECTV imposed this agreement on its customers, it assumed that the arbitration clause would be unenforceable in California.  App. 52 (explaining in state-court filing that, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause California law would not enforce the arbitration agreement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0, DIRECTV has not sought and will not seek to arbitrate disputes with California customers\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, any California customer who read the agreement would scarcely have understood that she had submitted to bilateral arbitration of any and all disputes with DIRECTV.  She certainly would have had no reason to anticipate the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Concepcion</i>, rendered four years later, or to consider whether \xe2\x80\x9claw of your state\xe2\x80\x9d is a chameleon term meaning California legislation when she received her service contract, but preemptive federal law later on.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">DIRECTV primarily responds that the FAA requires construction of all terms in arbitration agreements in favor of arbitrability.  True, this Court has found in the FAA a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal policy favoring arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10 (quoting <i>Volt Information Sciences</i>, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 476).  But the Court has also cautioned that an arbitration-favoring presumption applies \xe2\x80\x9conly where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed[, is] legally enforceable[,] and [is] best construed to encompass the dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Granite Rock Co. </i>v. <i>Teamsters</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287,\n303 (2010)\n.  DIRECTV acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involves a threshold dispute over the enforceability of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x9d in its entirety.  Reply Brief 7.  Like the California court, I would resolve that dispute by employing traditional rules of contract interpretation <i>sans </i>any arbitration-favoring presumption, including the rule that ambiguous language should be construed against the drafter.  See<i> supra,</i> at 3, 7.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision steps beyond <i>Concepcion </i>and <i>Italian Colors</i>.  There, as here, the Court misread the FAA to deprive consumers of effective relief against powerful economic entities that write no-class-action arbitration clauses into their form contracts.  In <i>Concepcion</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 336, customers brought a class action claiming that AT&amp;T Mobility had improperly charged $30.22 in sales tax while advertising cellular telephones as free.  AT&amp;T Mobility\xe2\x80\x99s form consumer contract contained a mandatory arbitration clause and a class-arbitration proscription.  Because consumers lacked input into the contractual terms, and because few rational consumers would go through the hassle of pursuing a $30.22 claim in bilateral arbitration, the California courts deemed the arbitration agreement unenforceable as unconscionable.  See <i>id.</i>, at 365 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he maximum gain to a customer for the hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just $30.22.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Laster </i>v. <i>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC</i>, 584 F.\xc2\xa03d 849, 856 (CA9 2009))); <i>Carnegie </i>v. <i>Household Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <i>realistic</i> alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\xe2\x80\x9d), cert. denied,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1051 (2005)\n.  Nonetheless, the Court held that the FAA mandated enforcement of the entire arbitration agreement, including the class-arbitration ban.  <i>Concepcion</i>, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 343.  Two years later, in <i>Italian Colors</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5), the Court reaffirmed that class-arbitration prohibitions are enforceable even where claimants \xe2\x80\x9chave no economic incentive to pursue their .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. claims individually in arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Today, the Court holds that consumers lack not only protection against unambiguous class-arbitration bans in adhesion contracts.  They lack even the benefit of the doubt when anomalous terms in such contracts reasonably could be construed to protect their rights.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These decisions have predictably resulted in the deprivation of consumers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to seek redress for losses, and, turning the coin, they have insulated powerful economic interests from liability for violations of consumer-protection laws.  See N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Nov. 1, 2015, p. A1, col. 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cBy inserting individual arbitration clauses into a soaring number of consumer and employment contracts, companies [have] devised a way to circumvent the courts and bar people from joining together in class-action lawsuits, realistically the only tool citizens have to fight illegalor deceitful business practices.\xe2\x80\x9d).

See Resnik, Diffusing Disputes 2860 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe merchants and lawyers who forged the public law of arbitration in the United States sought federal legislation to enforce <i>consensual</i> agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the text of the FAA compel this result.  Section 2, on which the Court relied in <i>Concepcion</i>, <i>Italian Colors</i>, and this case, prescribes simply that arbitration provisions are to be treated the same as other contractual terms: \xe2\x80\x9c[a] written provision in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforce-able, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.
