Bayer thought such an injunction warranted because, in a separate case, Bayer had persuaded the same Federal District Court to deny a similar class-certification motion that had been filed against Bayer by a different plaintiff, George McCollins.  The District Court had denied McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 certification motion under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court granted Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s requested injunction against the state court proceedings, holding that its denial of certification in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 case precluded litigation of the certification issue in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  It first noted that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act) generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.  But it found that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s relitigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his proposed class.  In so doing, the court concluded that Smith was invoking a State Rule, W.\xc2\xa0Va. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023, that was sufficiently similar to the Federal Rule McCollins had invoked, such that the certification issues presented in the two cases were the same.  The court further held that Smith, as an unnamed member of McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 putative class action, could be bound by the judgment in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 case.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>In enjoining the state court from considering Smith\xe2\x80\x99s class certification request, the federal court exceeded its authority under the \xe2\x80\x9crelitigation exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under that Act, a federal court \xe2\x80\x9cmay not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except\xe2\x80\x9d in rare cases, when necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect or effectuate [the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s] judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

Co., </em>398 U. S., at 297.  The exception at issue in this case, known as the \xe2\x80\x9crelitigation exception,\xe2\x80\x9d authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue \xe2\x80\x9cthat previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chick Kam Choo,</em> 486 U. S., at 147.  This exception is designed to implement \xe2\x80\x9cwell-recognized concepts\xe2\x80\x9d of claim and issue preclusion.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the <em>second </em>court\xe2\x80\x94here, the West Virginia court\xe2\x80\x94every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court, see <em>Atlantic Coast Line</em>, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.  For the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s class-action determination to preclude the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s motion, at least two conditions must be met.  First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.  And second, Smith must have been a party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.  This case is little more than a rerun of <em>Chick Kam Choo.  </em>There, a federal court dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds and then enjoined the plaintiff from pursuing the \xe2\x80\x9csame\xe2\x80\x9d claim in Texas state court.  However, because the legal standards for <em>forum non conveniens</em> differed in the two courts, the issues before those courts differed, making an injunction unwarranted.  Here, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s proposed class mirrored McCollins\xe2\x80\x99, and the two suits\xe2\x80\x99 substantive claims broadly overlapped.  But the federal court adjudicated McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 certification motion under Federal Rule 23, whereas the state court was poised to consider Smith\xe2\x80\x99s proposed class under W.\xc2\xa0Va.<em> </em>Rule 23.  And the State Supreme Court has generally stated that it will not necessarily interpret its Rule 23 as coterminous with the Federal Rule.  Absent clear evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to State Rule 23 tracking the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 case, this Court could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule the same way and, thus, could not tell whether the certification issues in the two courts were the same.  That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.  And indeed, the case against an injunction here is even stronger, because the State Supreme Court has expressly disapproved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s predominance requirement embraced by the Federal District Court.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s injunction was independently improper because Smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.  Generally, a party \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States ex rel. Eisenstein</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___, or who \xe2\x80\x9cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>May</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/72/index.html">484 U. S. 72</a>, 77.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom McCollins was denied leave to represent.  The only exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the exception that binds non-named members of \xe2\x80\x9cproperly conducted class actions\xe2\x80\x9d to judgments entered in such proceedings.  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Sturgell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/880/index.html">553 U. S. 880</a>, 894.  But McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit was not a proper class action.  Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues should have preclusive effect is the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to certify a class.  Absent certification of a class under Federal Rule 23, the precondition for binding Smith was not met.  Neither a proposed, nor a rejected, class action may bind nonparties.  See <em>id.,</em> at 901.  Bayer claims that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to class actions would permit class counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing plaintiffs.  But principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and comity among courts generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs.  The right approach does not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment.  And to the extent class actions raise special relitigation problems, the federal Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 provides a remedy that does not involve departing from the usual preclusion rules.

The District Court did so because it had earlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case, brought by a different plaintiff against the same defendant alleging similar claims.  The federal court thought its injunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue it had decided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold to the contrary.  In issuing this order to a state court, the federal court exceeded its authority under the \xe2\x80\x9crelitigation exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the Anti-Injunction Act.  That statutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a state proceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cpro-tect or effectuate [the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s] judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72283.  Here, that standard was not met for two reasons.  First, the issue presented in the state court was not identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal.  And second, the plaintiff in the state court did not have the requisite connection to the federal suit to be bound by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the question before us involves the effect of a former adjudication on this case, we begin our statement of the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another.  In August 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer Corporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia, asserting various state-law claims arising from Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug called Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that same month).  McCollins contended that Bayer had violated West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s consumer-protection statute and the company\xe2\x80\x99s express and implied warranties by selling him a defective product.  And pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state court to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had also purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a class action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Approximately one month later, the suit now before us began in a different part of West Virginia.  Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed state-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County, West Virginia.  And like McCollins, Smith asked the court to certify under West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 23 a class of Baycol purchasers residing in the State.  Neither Smith nor McCollins knew about the other\xe2\x80\x99s suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332, 1441.  The case was then transferred to the District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which had consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (numbering in the tens of thousands) before a single District Court Judge.  See \xc2\xa71407.  Bayer, however, could not \nremove Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case to federal court because Smith \nhad sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to Bayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity.  See \xc2\xa71441(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s suit thus remained in the state courthouse in Brooke County.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the next six years, the two cases proceeded along their separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace.  By 2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their respective plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motions for class certification.  The Federal District Court was the first to reach a decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the District Court declined to certify McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 proposed class \nof West Virginia Baycol purchasers.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning proceeded in two steps.  The court first ruled that, under West Virginia law, each plaintiff would have to prove \xe2\x80\x9cactual injury\xe2\x80\x9d from his use of Baycol to recover.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  The court then held that because the necessary showing of harm would vary from plaintiff to plaintiff, \xe2\x80\x9cindividual issues of fact predominate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d over issues common to all members of the proposed class, and so the case was not suitable for class treatment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 45a.  In the same order, the District Court also dismissed McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 claims on the merits in light of his failure to demonstrate physical injury from his use of Baycol.  McCollins chose not to appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit was now concluded, Bayer asked the District Court for another order based upon it, this one affecting Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case in West Virginia.  In a motion\xe2\x80\x94receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit\xe2\x80\x94Bayer explained that the proposed class in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case was identical to the one the federal court had just rejected.  Bayer therefore requested that the federal court enjoin the West Virginia state court from hearing Smith\xe2\x80\x99s motion to certify a class.  According to Bayer, that order was appropriate to protect the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit denying class certification.  The District Court agreed and granted the injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Baycol Prods. Litigation, </em>593 F.\xc2\xa03d 716 (2010).  The court noted that the Anti-Injunction Act generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.  But the court held that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s relitigation exception authorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his proposed class.  According to the court, Smith was invoking a similar class action rule as McCollins had used to seek certification \xe2\x80\x9cof the same class\xe2\x80\x9d in a suit alleging \xe2\x80\x9cthe same legal theories,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 724; the issue in the state court therefore was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently identical\xe2\x80\x9d to the one the federal court had decided to warrant preclusion, <em>ibid</em>.  In addition, the court held, the parties in the two proceedings were sufficiently alike: Because Smith was an unnamed member of the class McCollins had proposed, and because their \xe2\x80\x9cinterests were aligned,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith was appropriately bound by the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. __ (2010), because the order issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from application of the Anti-Injunction Act\xe2\x80\x99s relitigation exception.  The first involves the requirement of preclusion law that a subsequent suit raise the \xe2\x80\x9csame issue\xe2\x80\x9d as a previous case.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The second concerns the scope of the rule that a court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment cannot bind nonparties.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We think the District Court erred on both grounds when it granted the injunction, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Anti-Injunction Act, first enacted in 1793, provides that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as \nexpressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where \nnecessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or \neffectuate its judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

That exception is de-signed to implement \xe2\x80\x9cwell-recognized concepts\xe2\x80\x9d of claim and issue preclusion.  <em>Chick Kam Choo,</em> 486 U. S., at 147.  The provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue \xe2\x80\x9cthat previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>But in applying this exception, we have taken special care to keep it \xe2\x80\x9cstrict and narrow.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 148.  After all, a court does not usually \xe2\x80\x9cget to dictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 C. Wright, \nA. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).  Deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the <em>second </em>court (here, the one in West Virginia).  So issuing an injunction under the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  For that reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court, see <em>Atlantic Coast Line</em>, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question here is whether the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 proposed class precluded a later adjudication in state court of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s certification motion.  For the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the class issue to have this preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.  See 18 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74417, at 412.  And second, Smith must have been a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.  See 18A <em>id., </em>\xc2\xa74449, at 330.  In fact, \nas we will explain, the issues before the two courts were not the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the ex-ceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound.  So the courts below erred in finding the certification issue precluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction appropriate.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our most recent case on the relitigation exception, <em>Chick Kam Choo </em>v. <em>Exxon</em>,<em> </em>we applied the \xe2\x80\x9csame issue\xe2\x80\x9d requirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s injunction.  486 U. S., at 151.  The federal court had dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.  After the plaintiff brought the same claim in Texas state court, the federal court issued an injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in that alternate forum.  We held that the District Court had gone too far.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation exception,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis that the \xe2\x80\xa6 issues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings actually have been decided by the federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 148.  That prerequisite, we thought, was not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in state court was not the one the federal court had resolved.  The federal court had considered the permissibility of the claim under federal <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles.  But the Texas courts, we thought, \xe2\x80\x9cwould apply a significantly different <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 149; they had in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal doctrine.  Our conclusion followed: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether the Texas <em>state </em>courts are an appropriate forum for [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] Singapore law claims has not yet been litigated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Because the legal standards in the two courts differed, the issues before the courts differed, and an injunction was unwarranted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question here closely resembles the one in <em>Chick Kam Choo.  </em>The class Smith proposed in state court mirrored the class McCollins sought to certify in federal court: Both included all Baycol purchasers resident in West Virginia.  Moreover, the substantive claims in the two suits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that Bayer had sold a defective product in violation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s consumer protection law and the company\xe2\x80\x99s warranties.  So far, so good for preclusion.  But not so fast: \na critical question\xe2\x80\x94the question of the applicable legal standard\xe2\x80\x94remains.  The District Court ruled that the proposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal Rule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate over common ones).  But the state court was poised to consider whether the proposed class satisfied <em>West Virginia </em>Rule 23.  If those two legal standards differ (as federal and state <em>forum non conveniens </em>law differed in <em>Chick Kam Choo</em>)\xe2\x80\x94then the federal court resolved an issue not before the state court.  In that event, much like in <em>Chick Kam Choo</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the [West Virginia] <em>state </em>cour[t]\xe2\x80\x9d should certify the proposed class action \xe2\x80\x9chas not yet been litigated.\xe2\x80\x9d  486 U. S., at 149.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two competing ways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal Rules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in the middle.  The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively on the near-identity of the two Rules\xe2\x80\x99 texts.  See 593 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 723.  That was the right place to start, but not to end.  Federal and state courts, after all, can and do apply identically worded procedural provisions in widely varying ways.  If a State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural provision tracks the language of a Federal Rule, but a state court interprets that provision in a manner federal courts have not, then the state court is using a different standard and thus deciding a different issue.  See 18 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74417, at 454 (stating that preclusion is \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent legal standards \xe2\x80\xa6 masquerad[e] behind similar legal labels\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the other extreme, Smith contends that the source of law is all that matters: a different sovereign must in each and every case \xe2\x80\x9chave the opportunity, if it chooses, to construe its procedural rule differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI, Principles of the Law, Aggregate Litigation \xc2\xa72.11, Reporters\xe2\x80\x99 Notes, <em>cmt. b</em>, p.\xc2\xa0181 (2010)).  But if state courts have made crystal clear that they follow the same approach as the federal court applied, we see no need to ignore that determination; in that event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the same.  So a federal court considering whether the relitigation exception applies should examine whether state law parallels its federal counterpart.  But as suggested earlier, see <em>supra</em>, at 6, the federal court must resolve any uncertainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion to the state courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme Court has gone some way toward resolving the matter before us by declaring its independence from federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the Federal Rules\xe2\x80\x94and particularly of Rule 23.  In <em>In\xc2\xa0re W.\xc2\xa0Va. Rezulin Litigation, </em>214 W.\xc2\xa0Va. 52, 585 S. E. 2d 52 (2003) <em>(In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin)</em>, the West Virginia high court considered a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s motion to certify a class\xe2\x80\x94coincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defective pharmaceutical product.  The court made a point of complaining about the parties\xe2\x80\x99 and lower court\xe2\x80\x99s near-exclusive reliance on federal cases about Federal Rule 23 to decide the certification question.  Such cases, the court cautioned, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may be persuasive, but [they are] not binding or controlling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 61, 585 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 61.  And lest anyone mistake the import of this message, the court went on: The aim of \xe2\x80\x9cthis rule is to avoid having our legal analysis of our Rules \xe2\x80\x98amount to nothing more than Pavlovian responses to federal decisional law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(italics omitted)<em>.</em>  Of course, the state courts might still have adopted an approach to their Rule 23 that tracked the analysis the federal court used in McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 case.  But absent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule in the same way.  And if that is so, we could not tell whether the certification issues in the state and federal courts were the same.  That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But here the case against an injunction is even stronger, because the West Virginia Supreme Court has <em>disapproved</em> the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s predominance requirement that the Federal District Court embraced.  Recall that the federal court held that the presence of \na single individualized issue\xe2\x80\x94injury from the use of \nBaycol\xe2\x80\x94prevented class certification.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  The court did not identify the common issues in the case; nor did it balance these common issues against the need to prove individual injury to determine which predominated.  The court instead applied a strict test barring class treatment when proof of each plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury is necessary.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  By contrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court in <em>In\xc2\xa0\nre Rezulin </em>adopted an all-things-considered, balancing inquiry in interpreting its Rule 23.  Rejecting any \xe2\x80\x9crigid test,\xe2\x80\x9d the state court opined that the predominance requirement \xe2\x80\x9ccontemplates a review of many factors.\xe2\x80\x9d 214 W.\xc2\xa0Va., at 72, 585 S. E. 2d, at 72.  Indeed, the court noted, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98single common issue\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in a case could outweigh \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98numerous \xe2\x80\xa6 individual questions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>That meant, the court further explained (quoting what it termed the \xe2\x80\x9cleading treatise\xe2\x80\x9d on the subject), that even objections to certification \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98based on \xe2\x80\xa6 causation, or reliance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which typically involve showings of individual injury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98will not bar predominance satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting 2 A. Conte &amp; H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions \xc2\xa74.26, p. 241 (4th ed. 2002))<em>.  </em>So point for point, the analysis set out in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin</em> diverged from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Federal Rule 23.  A state court using the <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin </em>standard would decide a different question than the one the federal court had earlier resolved.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of <em>Chick Kam Choo</em>.  A federal court and a state court apply different law.  That means they decide distinct questions.  The federal court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of one issue does not preclude the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination of another.  It then goes without saying that the federal court may not issue an injunction.  The <em>Anti</em>-Injunction Act\xe2\x80\x99s <em>re</em>-litigation exception does not extend nearly so far.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The injunction issued here runs into another basic premise of preclusion law: A court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment binds only the parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete and limited exceptions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74449, at 330.  The importance of this rule and the narrowness of its exceptions go hand in hand.  We have repeatedly \xe2\x80\x9cemphasize[d] the fundamental nature of the general rule\xe2\x80\x9d that only parties can be bound by prior judgments; accordingly, we have taken a \xe2\x80\x9cconstrained approach to nonparty preclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Sturgell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/880/index.html">553 U. S. 880</a>, 898 (2008).  Against this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below by arguing that Smith\xe2\x80\x94an unnamed member of a proposed but uncertified class\xe2\x80\x94qualifies as a party to the McCollins litigation.  See Brief for Respondent 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  Alternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class actions.  See <em>id</em>., at 34\xe2\x80\x9339.  We think neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s first claim ill-comports with any proper understanding of what a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d is.  In general, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] \xe2\x80\x98party\xe2\x80\x99 to litigation is \xe2\x80\x98[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States ex rel. Eisenstein</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, 556 U.

S. 72</a>, 77 (1987).  And we have further held that an unnamed member of a <em>certified </em>class may be \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered a \xe2\x80\x98party\xe2\x80\x99 for the [particular] purpos[e] of appealing\xe2\x80\x9d an adverse judgment.  <em>Devlin</em> v. <em>Scardelletti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/1/index.html">536 U. S. 1</a>, 7 (2002).  But as the dissent in <em>Devlin</em> noted, no one in that case was \xe2\x80\x9cwilling to advance the novel and surely erroneous argument that a nonnamed class member is a party to the class-action litigation <em>before the class is certified.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 16, n. 1<em> </em>(opinion of Scalia, J.).  Still less does that argument make sense <em>once certification is denied</em>. <em> </em>The definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d can on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied leave to represent.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  If the judgment in the McCollins litigation can indeed bind Smith, it must do so under principles of <em>non</em>party preclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37, one such principle allows unnamed members of a class action to be bound, even though they are not parties to the suit.  See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/867/index.html">467 U. S. 867</a>, 874 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder elementary principles of prior adjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class action is binding on class members in any subsequent litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Taylor</em>, 553 U. S., at 894 (stating that nonparties can be bound in \xe2\x80\x9cproperly conducted class actions\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here Bayer faces a conundrum.  If we know one thing about the McCollins suit, we know that it was <em>not</em> a class action.  Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues ought to be given preclusive effect is the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that a class could not properly be certified.  So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class action (because it is only as such that a nonparty in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s situation can be bound) to a determination that there could not be a class action.  And if the logic of that position is not immediately transparent, here is Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to clarify: \xe2\x80\x9c[U]ntil the moment when class certi-fication was denied, the <em>McCollins</em> case <em>was </em>a properly conducted class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 37.  That is true, according to Bayer, because McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 interests were aligned with the members of the class he proposed and he \xe2\x80\x9cact[ed] in a representative capacity when he sought class certification.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 36.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But wishing does not make it so.  McCollins sought class certification, but he failed to obtain that result.  Because the District Court found that individual issues predominated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for class proceedings.  In these circumstances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class action existed at any time in the litigation.  Federal Rule 23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal court, where McCollins brought his suit.  So in the absence of a certification under that Rule, the precondition for binding Smith was not met.  Neither a proposed class action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties.  What does have this effect is a class action approved under Rule 23.  But McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit was never that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We made essentially these same points in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Sturgell </em>just a few Terms ago.  The question there concerned the propriety of binding nonparties under a theory of \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation\xe2\x80\x9d based on \xe2\x80\x9cidentity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties.\xe2\x80\x9d  553 U. S., at 901.  We rejected the theory unanimously, explaining that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould \xe2\x80\x98recogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Such a device, we objected, would authorize preclusion \xe2\x80\x9cshorn of [Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s] procedural protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Or as otherwise stated in the opinion: We could not allow \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvent[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d of Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s protections through a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to \xe2\x80\x98create <em>de facto </em>class actions at will.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>We could hardly have been more clear that a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly conducted class action,\xe2\x80\x9d with binding effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts in just one way\xe2\x80\x94through the procedure set out in Rule 23.  Bayer attempts to distinguish <em>Taylor </em>by noting that the party in the prior litigation there did not propose a class action.  But we do not see why that difference matters.  Yes, McCollins wished to represent a class, and made a motion to that effect.  But it did not come to pass.  To allow McCollins\xe2\x80\x99 suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt the very theory <em>Taylor </em>rejected.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s strongest argument comes not from established principles of preclusion, but instead from policy concerns relating to use of the class action device.  Bayer warns that under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try to certify the same class \xe2\x80\x9cby the simple expedient of changing the named plaintiff in the caption of the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  And in this world of \xe2\x80\x9cserial relitigation of class certification,\xe2\x80\x9d Bayer contends, defendants \xe2\x80\x9cwould be forced in effect to buy litigation peace by settling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2, 12; see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation,</em> \n333 F.\xc2\xa03d 763, 767 (CA7 2003) (objecting to an \xe2\x80\x9can asymmetric system in which class counsel can win but never lose\xe2\x80\x9d because of their ability to relitigate the issue of \ncertification).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this form of argument flies in the face of the rule against nonparty preclusion.  That rule perforce leads to relitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after plaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because none a party to the last suit) tries his hand at establishing some legal principle or obtaining some grant of relief.  We confronted a similar policy concern in <em>Taylor</em>, which involved litigation brought under the Freedom of Infor-mation Act (FOIA).  The Government there cautioned \nthat unless we bound nonparties a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98potentially limitless\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d number of plaintiffs, perhaps coordinating with each other, could \xe2\x80\x9cmount a series of repetitive lawsuits\xe2\x80\x9d demanding the selfsame documents.  553 U. S., at 903.  But we rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a single successful FOIA suit\xe2\x80\x94disclosure of documents to the public\xe2\x80\x94could \xe2\x80\x9ctrum[p]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubsum[e]\xe2\x80\x9d all prior losses, just as a single successful class certification motion could do.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bridgestone/Firestone</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 766, 767.  As that response suggests, our legal system generally relies on principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and comity among courts to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs.  We have not thought that the right approach (except in the discrete categories of cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And to the extent class actions raise special problems of relitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not involve departing from the usual rules of preclusion.  In the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled defendants to remove to federal court any sizable class action involving minimal diversity of citizenship.  Once removal takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification.  And federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping suits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many actions involving Baycol).  See \xc2\xa71407.  Finally, we would expect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each other\xe2\x80\x99s class certification decisions when addressing a common dispute.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc.</em> v. <em>Bill Harbert Constr. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/193/index.html">529 U. S. 193</a>, 198 (2000) (citing <em>Landis</em> v. <em>North American Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/248/index.html">299 U. S. 248</a>, 254 (1936)).  CAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to suits like this one beginning before its enactment.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to address the relitigation concerns associated with class actions through the mechanism of removal provides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere \nin this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  And once again, that is especially so when the federal court is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state proceeding.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District Court entered here.

As we said more than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained since that time, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny doubts \xe2\x80\xa6 should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Coast Line</em>, 398 U.

But this case does not even strike us as close.  The issues in the federal and state lawsuits differed because the relevant legal standards differed.

S. 281</a>, 287 (1970). </p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect of a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity.  See <em>Semtek Int\xe2\x80\x99l Inc.</em> v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/497/index.html">531 U. S. 497</a>, 508 (2001).  Smith assumes that federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s preclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15\xe2\x80\x9316, whereas Bayer favors looking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal interests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18.  We do not think the question matters here.  Neither party identifies any way in which federal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant respect.  Nor have we found any such divergence.  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Montana</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/147/index.html">440 U. S. 147</a>, 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (1979) (describing elements of issue preclusion), with <em>State</em> v. <em>Miller, </em>194 W.\xc2\xa0Va. 3, 9, 459 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same).  We therefore need not decide whether, in general, federal common law ought to incorporate state law in situations such as this.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the principles of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith\xe2\x80\x99s argument, based on <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Shutts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/797/index.html">472 U. S. 797</a> (1985), that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s action violated the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the predominance inquiry is consistent with the approach employed by the Eighth Circuit.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re St. Jude Medical, Inc.</em>, 522 F. 3d 836, 837\xe2\x80\x93840 (2008) (holding that most commercial misrepresentation cases are \xe2\x80\x9cunsuitable for class treatment\xe2\x80\x9d because individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate).  We express no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Bayer argues that <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin </em>does not preclude an injunction in this case because the West Virginia court there decided that common issues predominated over individual issues of damages, not over individual issues of liability (as exist here).  See Brief for Respondent 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  We think Bayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its consequence.  Our point is not that <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin</em> dictates the answer \nto the class certification question here; the two cases are indeed too dissimilar for that to be true.  The point instead is that <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rezulin </em>articulated a general approach to the predominance requirement that differs markedly from the one the federal court used.  Minor variations in the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat preclusion; but where, as here, the State\xe2\x80\x99s courts \xe2\x80\x9cwould apply a significantly different \xe2\x80\xa6 analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chick Kam Choo</em> v. <em>Exxon Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/140/index.html"></a><a href="/us/486/140/index.html">486 U. S. 140</a>, 149 (1988), the federal and state courts decide different issues.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two cases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class may wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an individual claim or move to intervene in the suit.  See Brief for Respondent 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (citing <em>United Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>McDonald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/385/index.html">432 U. S. 385</a> (1977); <em>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Utah</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/538/index.html">414 U. S. 538</a> (1974)).  But these cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial administration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class suit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations period) related to that proceeding.  See <em>id.,</em> at 553; <em>McDonald</em>, 432 U. S., at 394, n.\xc2\xa015.<em> </em>That result is consistent with a commonplace of preclusion law\xe2\x80\x94that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even though they cannot be bound by, former litigation. See <em>Parklane Hosiery Co.</em> v. <em>Shore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/322/index.html">439 U. S. 322</a>, 326\xe2\x80\x93333 (1979); <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.</em> v. <em>University of Ill. Foundation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/313/index.html">402 U. S. 313</a> (1971).</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The great weight of scholarly authority\xe2\x80\x94from the Restatement of Judgments to the American Law Institute to Wright and Miller\xe2\x80\x94agrees that an uncertified class action cannot bind proposed class members.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa741(1), p. 393 (1980) (A nonparty may be bound only when his interests are adequately represented by \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he representative of a class of persons similarly situated, designated as such with the approval of the court<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em>); ALI, Principles of the Law Aggregate Litigation \xc2\xa72.11, Reporters\xe2\x80\x99 Notes, <em>cmt. b</em>, p. 181 (2010) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]one of [the exceptions to the rule against nonparty preclusion] extend generally to the situation of a would-be absent class member with respect to a denial of class certification\xe2\x80\x9d); 18A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74455, at 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]bsent certification there is no basis for precluding a nonparty\xe2\x80\x9d under the class-action exception).</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0By the same token, nothing in our holding today forecloses legislation to modify established principles of preclusion should Congress decide that CAFA does not sufficiently prevent relitigation of class certification motions.  Nor does this opinion at all address the permissibility of a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to this question.
