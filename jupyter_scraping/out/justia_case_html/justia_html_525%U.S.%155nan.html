Argued November 10, 1998-Decided January 12, 1999</p><p>Before plaintiff/respondent Tseng boarded an El Al Israel Airlines flight from New York to Tel Aviv, El Al subjected her to an intrusive security search. Tseng sued El Al for damages in a New York state court, asserting a state-law personal injury claim for, <i>inter alia, </i>assault and false imprisonment, but alleging no bodily injury. El Al removed the case to the Federal District Court, which dismissed the claim on the basis of the treaty popularly known as the Warsaw Convention. Key Convention provisions declare that the treaty "appl[ies] to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft for hire," Ch. I, Art. 1(1); describe three areas of air carrier liability, Ch. III, Arts. 17 (bodily injuries suffered as a result of an "accident ... on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking"), 18 (baggage or goods destruction, loss, or damage), and 19 (damage caused by delay); and instruct that "cases covered by article 17" "can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in thEe] [C]onvention," Art. 24. Tseng\'s claim was not compensable under Article 17, the District Court stated, because Tseng sustained no bodily injury as a result of the search, and the Convention does not permit recovery for solely psychic or psychosomatic injury (citing <i>Eastern Airlines, Inc. </i>v. <i>Floyd, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/530/case.html">499 U. S. 530</a>, 552). That court further concluded that Tseng could not pursue her claim, alternately, under New York tort law because Article 24 shields the carrier from liability for personal injuries not compensable under Article 17. Reversing in relevant part, the Second Circuit concluded first that no "accident" within Article 17\'s compass had occurred. In that court\'s view, the Convention drafters did not aim to impose close to absolute liability for an individual\'s personal reaction to "routine operating procedures," which, although inconvenient and embarrassing, are the price passengers pay for airline safety. The court next concluded that the Convention does not shield the same routine operating procedures from assessment under the diverse laws of signatory nations (and, in the case of the United States, States within one Nation) governing assault and false imprisonment. Article 24, the court said, precludes resort to local law only where the incident is "covered" by Article 17, i. <i>e., </i>where there has been an accident, either on the plane or in the course of embarking or disembarking,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="156">156</a></p><p>156 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p align="center">\nSyllabus</p><p>which led to bodily injury. The court found support in the drafting history of the Convention, which it construed to indicate that national law was intended to provide the passenger\'s remedy where the Convention did not expressly apply.

So read, Article 24 precludes a passenger from asserting any air transit personal injury claims under local law, including claims that fail to satisfy Article 17\'s liability conditions, notably, because the injury did not result from an "accident," see <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 405, or because the "accident" did not result in physical injury or physical manifestation of injury, see <i>Floyd, </i>499 U. S., at 552.

Pp. 166-169.</p><p>(b) Recourse to local law would undermine the uniform regulation of international air carrier liability that the Convention was designed to foster. See, <i>e. g., Floyd, </i>499 U. S., at 552. The Convention\'s signa-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="157">157</a></p><p>tories, in the treaty\'s preamble, specifically recognized the advantage of regulating carrier liability in a uniform manner. To provide the desired uniformity, Chapter III sets out an array of liability rules applicable to all international air transportation of persons, baggage, and goods. These rules delineate the three areas of carrier liability (Articles 17, 18, and 19), the conditions exempting carriers from liability (Article 20), the monetary limits of liability (Article 22), and the circumstances in which carriers may not limit liability (Articles 23 and 25). Given the Convention\'s comprehensive scheme of liability rules and its textual emphasis on uniformity, the Court would be hard put to conclude that the Warsaw delegates meant to subject air carriers to the distinct, nonuniform liability rules of the individual signatory nations. The Second Circuit misperceived the meaning of <i>Zicherman, </i>which acknowledged the Convention\'s central endeavor to foster uniformity in the law of international air travel. See 516 U. S., at 230. <i>Zicherman </i>determined that Warsaw drafters intended to resolve <i>whether there </i>is <i>liability, </i>but to leave to domestic law (the local law identified by the forum under its choice-of-Iaw rules or approaches) determination of the compensatory damages available to the suitor. See id., at 231.</p><p>Articles 17,22, and 24 of the Convention are also designed as a compromise between the interests of passengers seeking recovery for personal injuries, and the interests of air carriers seeking to limit potential liability. See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Floyd, </i>499 U. S., at 546. In Article 17, carriers are denied the contractual prerogative to exclude or limit their liability for personal injury. In Articles 22 and 24, passengers are limited in the amount of damages they may recover, and are restricted in the claims they may pursue by the Convention\'s conditions and limits. Construing the Convention, as did the Second Circuit, to allow passengers to pursue claims under local law when the Convention does not permit recovery could produce several anomalies. Carriers might be exposed to unlimited liability under diverse legal regimes, but would be prevented, under the treaty, from contracting out of such liability. Passengers injured physically in an emergency landing might be subject to the liability caps of the Convention, while those merely traumatized in the same mishap would be free to sue outside of the Convention for potentially unlimited damages. The Second Circuit\'s construction would encourage artful pleading by plaintiffs seeking to opt out of the Convention\'s liability scheme when local law promised recovery in excess of that prescribed by the treaty. Such a reading would scarcely advance the predictability that adherence to the treaty has achieved worldwide.</p><p>The Second Circuit feared that a reading of Article 17 to exclude relief outside the Convention for Tseng would deprive a passenger injured by</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="158">158</a></p><p>158 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p align="center">\nSyllabus</p><p>a malfunctioning escalator in the airline\'s terminal of recourse against the airline, even if the airline recklessly disregarded its duty to keep the escalator in proper repair. The Convention\'s preemptive effect on local law, however, extends no further than the Convention\'s own substantive scope. A carrier, therefore, is subject to liability under local law for passenger injuries occurring before "any of the operations of embarking or disembarking," Art. 17. Tseng raised the concern that carriers will escape liability for their intentional torts if passengers are not permitted to pursue personal injury claims outside of the Convention\'s terms. But this Court has already cautioned that the definition of "accident" under Article 17 is an "unusual event ... <i>external to the passenger," </i>and that "[t]his definition should be flexibly applied." <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 405 (emphasis added). The parties chose not to pursue here the question whether an "accident" occurred, for an affirmative answer would still leave Tseng unable to recover under the treaty; she sustained no "bodily injury" and could not gain compensation under Article 17 for her solely psychic or psychosomatic injuries. Pp. 169-172.</p><p>(c) The Article 17 drafting history is consistent with this Court\'s understanding of the preemptive effect of the Convention. Although a preliminary draft of the Convention made carriers liable "\'in the case of death, wounding, or any other bodily injury suffered by a traveler,\'" <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 401, the later draft that prescribed what is now Article 17 narrowed airline liability to encompass only bodily injury caused by an "accident." It is improbable that, at the same time the drafters narrowed the conditions of liability in Article 17, they intended, in Article 24, to permit passengers to skirt those conditions by pursuing claims under local law. Inspecting the drafting history, the Second Circuit stressed a proposal by the Czechoslovak delegation to state in the treaty that, in the absence of a stipulation in the Convention itself, the provisions of laws and national rules relative to carriage in each signatory state would apply. That proposal was withdrawn upon amendment of the Convention\'s title to read "CONVENTION FOR THE UNIFICATION OF <i>CERTAIN </i>RULES RELATING To INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION BY AIR." (Emphasis added.) The British House of Lords found this drafting history inconclusive, reasoning that the inclusion of the word "certain" in the Convention\'s title indicated that the Convention was concerned with certain rules only, not with all the rules relating to international carriage by air; that the Convention is a partial harmonization, directed to the particular issues with which it deals, including a carrier\'s liability to passengers for personal injury; and that, given the Convention\'s overall objective to ensure uniformity, the Czechoslovak delegation may have meant only to underscore that national law controlled</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="159">159</a></p><p>chapters of law relating to international air carriage with which the Convention was not attempting to deal. In light of the Lords\' exposition, the withdrawn Czechoslovak proposal will not bear the weight the Second Circuit placed on it. Pp.172-174.</p><p>(d) Montreal Protocol No.4, to which the United States has recently subscribed, amends Article 24 to provide, in relevant part: "In the carriage of passengers ... , any action for damages ... can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention .... " Under amended Article 24, Tseng and EI Al agree, the Convention\'s preemptive effect is clear: The treaty precludes passengers from bringing actions under local law when they cannot establish air carrier liability under the treaty. Revised Article 24 merely clarifies, it does not alter, the Convention\'s rule of exclusivity. Supporting the position that revised Article 24 provides for preemption not earlier established, Tseng urges that federal preemption of state law is disfavored generally, and particularly when matters of health and safety are at stake. Tseng overlooks in this regard that the nation-state, not subdivisions within one nation, is the focus of the Convention and the perspective of the treaty partners. The Court\'s home-centered preemption analysis, therefore, should not be applied, mechanically, in construing this country\'s international obligations. Decisions of the courts of other Convention signatories, including the House of Lords opinion already noted, corroborate the Court\'s understanding of the Convention\'s preemptive effect. Such decisions are entitled to considerable weight. <i>Saks, 470 </i>U. S., at 404.

The episode-insuit, both parties now submit, does not qualify as an "accident" within the meaning of the treaty popularly known as the Warsaw Convention, which governs air carrier liability for "all international transportation." 1 Tseng alleges psychic or psychosomatic injuries, but no "bodily injury," as that term is used in the Convention.

We resolve in this case the question on which we earlier reserved judgment.</p><p>At the outset, we highlight key provisions of the treaty we are interpreting. Chapter I of the Warsaw Convention, entitled "ScoPE-DEFINITIONS," declares in Article 1(1) that the "[C]onvention shall apply to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft for hire." 49 Stat. 3014.4 Chapter III, entitled "LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER," defines in Articles 17, 18, and 19 the three kinds of liability for which the Convention provides. Article 17 establishes the conditions of liability for personal injury to passengers:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking." 49 Stat. 3018.</p></blockquote><p>Article 18 establishes the conditions of liability for damage to baggage or goods. <i>Id., </i>at 3019.5 Article 19 establishes</p><p>4 Citations in this opinion are to the official English translation of the Convention.

On May 22, 1993, Tsui Yuan Tseng arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport (hereinafter JFK) to board an EI Al Israel Airlines flight to Tel Aviv. In conformity with standard EI Al preboarding procedures, a security guard questioned Tseng about her destination and travel plans. The guard considered Tseng\'s responses "illogical," and ranked her as a "high risk" passenger. Tseng was taken to a private security room where her baggage and person were searched for explosives and detonating devices. She was told to remove her shoes, jacket, and sweater, and to lower her blue jeans to mid-</p><p>6 Article 19 provides:</p><p>"The carrier shall be liable for damage occasioned by delay in the transportation by air of passengers, baggage, or goods." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>7 Chapter III of the Convention sets forth a number of other rules governing air carrier liability. Among these, Article 20 relieves a carrier of liability if it has "taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage." <i>Ibid. </i>Article 22 sets monetary limits on a carrier\'s liability for harm to passengers and baggage. See <i>ibid. </i>Article 23 invalidates "[a]ny [contract] provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in thEe] [C]onvention." <i>Id., </i>at 3020.

A female security guard then searched Tseng\'s body outside her clothes by hand and with an electronic security wand.</p><p>After the search, which lasted 15 minutes, EI Al personnel decided that Tseng did not pose a security threat and allowed her to board the flight. Tseng later testified that she "was really sick and very upset" during the flight, that she was "emotionally traumatized and disturbed" during her monthlong trip in Israel, and that, upon her return, she underwent medical and psychiatric treatment for the lingering effects of the body search. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/122/99/">122 F.3d 99</a>, 101 (CA2 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>Tseng filed suit against EI Al in 1994 in a New York state court of first instance. Her complaint alleged a state-law personal injury claim based on the May 22, 1993 episode at JFK. Tseng\'s pleading charged, <i>inter alia, </i>assault and false imprisonment, but alleged no bodily injury. EI Al removed the case to federal court.</p><p>The District Court, after a bench trial, dismissed Tseng\'s personal injury claim. See 919 F. Supp. 155 (SDNY 1996). That claim, the court concluded, was governed by Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, which creates a cause of action for personal injuries suffered as a result of an "accident ... in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking," 49 Stat. 3018. See 919 F. Supp., at 157-158. Tseng\'s claim was not compensable under Article 17, the District Court stated, because Tseng "sustained no bodily injury" as a result of the search, id., at 158, and the Convention does not permit "recovery for psychic or psychosomatic injury unaccompanied by bodily injury," <i>ibid. </i>(citing <i>Floyd, </i>499 U. S., at 552). The District Court further concluded that Tseng could not pursue her claim, alternately, under New York tort law; as that court read the Convention, Article 24 shields the carrier from liability for personal injuries not compensable under Article 17. See 919 F. Supp., at 158.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="165">165</a></p><p>The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part.

S. 1117 (1998).</p><p>9 An "accident" under Article 17 is "an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger." <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 405. That definition, we have cautioned, should "be flexibly applied after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger\'s injuries." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The District Court, "[u]sing the flexible application prescribed by the Supreme Court," concluded that EI AI\'s search of Tseng was an "accident": "[A] routine search, applied erroneously to plaintiff in the course of embarking on the aircraft, is fairly accurately characterized as an accident." 919 F. Supp. 155, 158 (SDNY 1996).</p><p>The Court of Appeals disagreed. That court described security searches as "routine" in international air travel, part of a terrorismprevention effort that is "widely recognized and encouraged in the law," and "the price passengers pay for the degree of airline safety so far afforded them." 122 F. 3d, at 103. The court observed that passengers reasonably should be aware of "routine operating procedures" of the kind EI Al conducts daily. <i>Ibid. </i>The risk of mistakes, i. <i>e., </i>that innocent persons will be erroneously searched, is "[i]nherent in any effort to detect malefactors," the court explained. <i>Ibid. </i>Tseng thus encountered "ordinary events and procedures of air transportation," the court concluded, and not "an unexpected or unusual event." <i>Id., </i>at 104.</p><p>It is questionable whether the Court of Appeals "flexibly applied" the definition of "accident" we set forth in <i>Saks. </i>Both parties, however, now accept the Court of Appeals\' disposition of that issue. In any event, even if EI AI\'s search of Tseng was an "accident," the core question of the Convention\'s exclusivity would remain.

The court found support in the drafting history of the Convention, which it construed to "indicate that national law was intended to provide the passenger\'s remedy where the Convention did not expressly apply." <i>Id., </i>at 105. The Second Circuit also rejected the argument that allowance of statelaw claims when the Convention does not permit recovery would contravene the treaty\'s goal of uniformity. The court read our decision in <i>Zicherman </i>v. <i>Korean Air Lines Co., 516 </i>U.

Article 25, now altered by Montreal Protocol No.4, concerned damage caused by "wilful misconduct." 49 Stat. 3020. On that matter, the District Court found "no evidence and no basis for inferring that [the selection of Tseng to be searched] was anything more than a mistake. Even if such a mistake can be characterized as misconduct," the District Court added, "there is no basis for inferring that it was wilful." 919 F. Supp., at 158. The Court of Appeals left the District Court\'s finding on the absence of "wilful misconduct" undisturbed. See 122 F. 3d, at 104. Tseng\'s brief in opposition to certiorari did not cite Article 25. We agree with the United States, as <i>amicus curiae, </i>that Tseng has not preserved any argument putting Article 25 at issue in this Court. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>18, n. 10.</p><p>11 The french text of Article 24 reads:</p><p>"(1) Dans les cas prevus aux articles 18 et 19 toute action en responsabilite, it quelque titre que ce soit, ne peut etre exercee que dans les conditions et limites prevues par la presente Convention.</p><p>"(2) Dans les cas prevus it l\'article 17, s\'appliquent egalement les dispositions de l\'alinea precedent, sans prejudice de la determination des personnes qui ont Ie droit d\'agir et de leurs droits respectifs." 49 Stat. 3006.</p><p>Literally translated, "les cas prevus it l\'article 17" means "the cases anticipated by Article 17," see The New Cassell\'s French Dictionary 132,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="168">168</a></p><p>168 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p>limits set out in thee] [C]onvention." 49 Stat. 3020. That prescription is not a model of the clear drafter\'s art. We recognize that the words lend themselves to divergent interpretation.</p><p>In Tseng\'s view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, "les cas prevus a l\'article 17" means those cases in which a passenger could actually maintain a claim for relief under Article 17. So read, Article 24 would permit any passenger whose personal injury suit did not satisfy the liability conditions of Article 17 to pursue the claim under local law.</p><p>In EI AI\'s view, on the other hand, and in the view of the United States as <i>amicus curiae, </i>"les cas prevus a l\'article 17" refers generically to all personal injury cases stemming from occurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking or disembarking, and simply distinguishes that class of cases (Article 17 cases) from cases involving damaged luggage or goods, or delay (which Articles 18 and 19 address). So read, Article 24 would preclude a passenger from asserting any air transit personal injury claims under local law, including claims that failed to satisfy Article 17\'s liability conditions, notably, because the injury did not result from an "accident," see <i>Saks, </i>470 U.

S., at 552; see <i>Zicherman, </i>516 U. S., at 230. The Convention signatories, in the treaty\'s preamble, specifically "recognized the advantage of regulating in a uniform manner the conditions of ... the liability of the carrier." 49 Stat. 3014. To provide the desired uniformity, Chapter III of the Convention sets out an array of liability rules which, the treaty declares, "apply to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft." <i>Ibid. </i>In that Chapter, the Convention describes and defines the three areas of air carrier liability (personal injuries in Article 17, baggage or goods loss, destruction, or damage in Article 18, and damage occasioned by delay in Article 19), the conditions exempting air carriers from liability (Article 20), the monetary limits of liability (Article 22), and the circumstances in which air carriers may not limit liability (Articles 23 and 25). See <i>supra, </i>at 162-163, and n. 7. Given the Convention\'s comprehensive scheme of liability rules and its textual emphasis on uniformity, we would be hard put to conclude that the delegates at Warsaw meant to subject air carriers to the distinct, nonuniform liability rules of the individual signatory nations.</p><p>The Court of Appeals looked to our precedent for guidance on this point, but it misperceived our meaning. It misread our decision in <i>Zicherman </i>to say that the Warsaw Convention expresses no compelling interest in uniformity that would warrant preempting an otherwise applicable body of law, here New York tort law. See 122 F. 3d, at 107; <i>supra, </i>at 166. <i>Zicherman </i>acknowledges that the Convention cen-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="170">170</a></p><p>170 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p>trally endeavors "to foster uniformity in the law of international air travel." 516 U. S., at 230. It further recognizes that the Convention addresses the question whether there is airline liability <i>vel non. </i>See <i>id., </i>at 231. The <i>Zicherman </i>case itself involved auxiliary issues: who may seek recovery in lieu of passengers, and for what harms they may be compensated. See id., at 221, 227. Looking to the Convention\'s text, negotiating and drafting history, contracting states\' postratification understanding of the Convention, and scholarly commentary, the Court in <i>Zicherman </i>determined that Warsaw drafters intended to resolve <i>whether there is liability, </i>but to leave to domestic law (the local law identified by the forum under its choice-of-Iaw rules or approaches) determination of the compensatory damages available to the suitor. See id., at 231.</p><p>A complementary purpose of the Convention is to accommodate or balance the interests of passengers seeking recovery for personal injuries, and the interests of air carriers seeking to limit potential liability. Before the Warsaw accord, injured passengers could file suits for damages, subject only to the limitations of the forum\'s laws, including the forum\'s choice-of-Iaw regime. This exposure inhibited the growth of the then-fledgling international airline industry. See <i>Floyd, </i>499 U. S., at 546; Lowenfeld &amp; Mendelsohn, The United States and the Warsaw Convention, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 497, 499-500 (1967). Many international air carriers at that time endeavored to require passengers, as a condition of air travel, to relieve or reduce the carrier\'s liability in case of injury. See Second International Conference on Private Aeronautical Law, October 4-12, 1929, Warsaw, Minutes 47 (R. Horner &amp; D. Legrez transls. 1975) (hereinafter Minutes). The Convention drafters designed Articles 17, 22, and 24 of the Convention as a compromise between the interests of air carriers and their customers worldwide. In Article 17 of the Convention, carriers are denied the contractual prerogative to exclude or limit their liability for personal injury. In</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="171">171</a></p><p>Articles 22 and 24, passengers are limited in the amount of damages they may recover, and are restricted in the claims they may pursue by the conditions and limits set out in the Convention.</p><p>Construing the Convention, as did the Court of Appeals, to allow passengers to pursue claims under local law when the Convention does not permit recovery could produce several anomalies. Carriers might be exposed to unlimited liability under diverse legal regimes, but would be prevented, under the treaty, from contracting out of such liability. Passengers injured physically in an emergency landing might be subject to the liability caps of the Convention, while those merely traumatized in the same mishap would be free to sue outside of the Convention for potentially unlimited damages. The Court of Appeals\' construction of the Convention would encourage artful pleading by plaintiffs seeking to opt out of the Convention\'s liability scheme when local law promised recovery in excess of that prescribed by the treaty. See <i>Potter </i>v. <i>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/98/881/">98 F.3d 881</a>, 886 (CAS 1996). Such a reading would scarcely advance the predictability that adherence to the treaty has achieved worldwide.12</p><p>The Second Circuit feared that if Article 17 were read to exclude relief outside the Convention for Tseng, then a passenger injured by a malfunctioning escalator in the airline\'s terminal would have no recourse against the airline, even if the airline recklessly disregarded its duty to keep the escalator in proper repair. See 122 F. 3d, at 107. As the United States pointed out in its <i>amicus curiae </i>submission, however, the Convention addresses and concerns, only and exclusively,</p><p>12 The Court of Appeals recognized that the Convention aimed to "balance the interests of the passenger and the carrier," but concluded that, with the "increasing strength of the airline industry, the balance has properly shifted away from protecting the carrier and toward protecting the passenger." 122 F. 3d, at 107. Postratification adjustments, however, are appropriately made by the treaty\'s signatories. See S. Exec. Rep. No. 105-20, at 5-6.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="172">172</a></p><p>172 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p>the airline\'s liability for passenger injuries occurring "on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking." Art. 17,49 Stat. 3018; see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>16. "[T]he Convention\'s preemptive effect on local law extends no further than the Convention\'s own substantive scope." <i>Ibid. </i>A carrier, therefore, "is indisputably subject to liability under local law for injuries arising outside of that scope: <i>e. </i>g., for passenger injuries occurring before \'any of the operations of embarking\'" or disembarking. <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting Article 17).</p><p>Tseng raises a different concern. She argues that air carriers will escape liability for their intentional torts if passengers are not permitted to pursue personal injury claims outside of the terms of the Convention. See Brief for Respondent 15-16. But we have already cautioned that the definition of "accident" under Article 17 is an "unusual event <i>... external to the passenger," </i>and that "[t]his definition should be flexibly applied." <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 405 (emphasis added). In <i>Saks, </i>the Court concluded that no "accident" occurred because the injury there-a hearing loss-"indisput ably result[ed] from <i>the passenger\'s own internal reaction </i>to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft." <i>Id., </i>at 406 (emphasis added). As we earlier noted, see <i>supra, </i>at 165-166, n. 9, Tseng and EI Al chose not to pursue in this Court the question whether an "accident" occurred, for an affirmative answer would still leave Tseng unable to recover under the treaty; she sustained no "bodily injury" and could not gain compensation under Article 17 for her solely psychic or psychosomatic injuries.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The drafting history of Article 17 is consistent with our understanding of the preemptive effect of the Convention. The preliminary draft of the Convention submitted to the conference at Warsaw made air carriers liable "in the case of death, wounding, or any other bodily injury suffered by a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="173">173</a></p><p>traveler." Minutes 264; see <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 401. In the later draft that prescribed what is now Article 17, airline liability was narrowed to encompass only bodily injury caused by an "accident." See Minutes 205. It is improbable that, at the same time the drafters narrowed the conditions of air carrier liability in Article 17, they intended, in Article 24, to permit passengers to skirt those conditions by pursuing claims under local law. 13</p><p>Inspecting the drafting history, the Court of Appeals stressed a proposal made by the Czechoslovak delegation to state in the treaty that, in the absence of a stipulation in the Convention itself, "\'the provisions of laws and national rules relative to carriage in each [signatory] State shall apply.\'\'\' 122 F. 3d, at 105 (quoting Minutes 176). That proposal was withdrawn upon amendment of the Convention\'s title to read:</p><p>"CONVENTION FOR THE UNIFICATION OF <i>CERTAIN </i>RULES RELATING To INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION By AIR." 49 Stat. 3014 (emphasis added); see 122 F. 3d, at 105.

Inclusion of the word "certain" in the Convention\'s title, the Lords reasoned, accurately indicated that "the [C]onvention is concerned with certain rules only, not with all the rules relating to international carriage by air." <i>I d., </i>at 204.

See 1 All E. R., at 201, 207. Reviewing the text, structure, and drafting history of the Convention, the Lords concluded that the Convention was designed to "ensure that, in all questions relating to the carrier\'s liability, it is the provisions of the [C]onvention which apply and that the passenger does not have access to any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise, which may be available within the particular country where he chooses to raise his action." <i>Ibid. </i>Courts of other nations bound by the Convention have also recognized the treaty\'s encompassing preemptive ef-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="176">176</a></p><p>176 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p>fect.16 The "opinions of our sister signatories," we have observed, are "entitled to considerable weight." <i>Saks, 470 </i>U.

The decision is nevertheless significant because, in the end, it rests on the novel premise that preemption analysis should be applied differently to treaties than to other kinds of federal law, see <i>ante, </i>at 175. Because I disagree with that premise, I shall briefly explain why I believe the Court has erred.</p><p>I agree with the Court that the drafters of the Convention intended that the treaty largely supplant local law. Article 24 preempts local law in three major categories: (1) personal injury claims arising out of an accident; 1 (2) claims for lost or damaged baggage; and (3) damage occasioned by transportation delays.2 Those categories surely comprise the</p><p>1 As we have already held, Article 17 only covers accidents, which we defined as "an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger." <i>Air France </i>v. <i>Saks, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/392/case.html">470 U. S. 392</a>, 405 (1985). Thus, I believe Article 24(2)\'s reference to Article 17 does not include nonaccidents.</p><p>As a leading treatise states with regard to Article 17: "If the passenger\'s lawyer does not want the Convention\'s limits to be applicable, he must either: a) prove the Convention does not apply because his client was not a passenger in international transportation as defined in Article 1; or b) if the Convention is applicable, that the limits are unavailable because the carrier failed to deliver a ticket as provided by Article 3; or c) the carrier was guilty of wilful misconduct (Article 25) or d) <i>there was no \'accident\'." </i>L. Goldhirsch, The Warsaw Convention Annotated: A Legal Handbook 55 (1988) (emphasis added).</p><p>2 Article 24 provides:</p><p>"(1) In the cases covered by articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this convention.</p><p>"(2) In the cases covered by article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="178">178</a></p><p>178 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. <i>v. </i>TSUI YUAN TSENG</p><p align="center">\nSTEVENS, J., dissenting</p><p>bulk of potential disputes between international air carriers and their passengers.</p><p>The Convention, however, does not preempt local law in cases arising out of "wilful misconduct." Article 25 expressly provides that a carrier shall not be entitled to avail itself of the provisions of the Convention that "exclude or limit" its liability if its misconduct is willful.3 Moreover, the question whether the carrier\'s wrongful act "is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct" is determined by "the law of the court to which the case is submitted." <i>Ibid. </i>Accordingly, the vast majority of the potential claims by passengers against international air carriers are either preempted by Article 24 or unequivocally governed by local law under Article 25.</p><p>Putting these cases aside, we are left with a narrow sliver of incidents involving personal injury that arise neither from an accident nor willful misconduct.4 Although the drafters of the treaty may not have realized that any such cases might arise, our construction of the term "accident" in <i>Air France </i>v. <i>Saks, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/392/case.html">470 U. S. 392</a>, 405 (1985), had the effect of either recognizing or creating this narrow band of cases. Frankly, I am not persuaded that this case belongs in this interstitial niche because I believe it should have been resolved by determining that petitioner\'s alleged misconduct was either an</p><p>3 Article 25 provides:</p><p>"(1) The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability, if the damage is caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court to which the case is submitted, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.</p><p>"(2) Similarly the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the said provisions, if the damage is caused under the same circumstances by any agent of the carrier acting within the scope of his employment."</p><p>4 Article 18 (damage to goods) and Article 19 (damage occasioned by delay) are not limited to accidents; any liability under local law for damages to goods or for delay is therefore explicitly preempted by Article 24(1).

Be that as it may, the parties have insisted that we decide the case on the assumption that it belongs in the sliver about which the treaty is silent.</p><p>This case and <i>Saks </i>therefore differ from each of the cases that the Court has cited in footnote 16 of its opinion to emphasize the importance of respecting "the treaty\'s encompassing preemptive effect," as none of those cases involved personal injury resulting from a nonaccident. <i>Ante, </i>at 175176.5 Given the unique character of this and the few other cases in the sliver, it is clear to me that the central purposes of the Convention will not be affected, whether we treat them like accident cases, which preempt local law, or like willful cases, which do not.</p><p>The overriding interest in achieving" \'uniformity of rules governing claims arising from international air transportation,\'" <i>ante, </i>at 169, will be accommodated in the situations</p><p>5 See <i>Gal </i>v. <i>Northern Mountain Helicopters Inc., </i>Dkt. No. 3491834918, 1998 B. C. T. C.

Courts both in this country and in our sister signatories have frequently found a hijacking to be an accident within the meaning of Article 17. See <i>Saks, </i>470 U. S., at 405; <i>Ayache </i>v. <i>Air-France, </i>38 Rev. fran~. dr. aerien 450, 451 [1984] (T. G. I. Paris, 1st ch.)

In those circumstances, the Convention\'s basic tradeoff between the carriers\' interest in avoiding unlimited liability and the passengers\' interest in obtaining compensation without proving fault will be fully achieved.</p><p>On the other hand, the interest in uniformity is disregarded in the category of cases that involve willful misconduct. Under the treaty, a reckless act or omission may constitute willful misconduct. See <i>Koirala </i>v. <i>Thai Airways </i>Int\'l, Ltd., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/126/1205/">126 F.3d 1205</a>, 1209-1210 <i>(CA9 </i>1997); Goldhirsch, <i>supra, </i>n. 1, at 121 (stating that most civil law jurisdictions have found that gross negligence satisfies Article 25). This broad definition increases the number of cases not preempted by the Convention. In these circumstances, the delegates at Warsaw did decide "to subject air carriers to the distinct, nonuniform liability rules of the individual signatory nations." <i>Ante, </i>at 169.</p><p>Thus, the interest in uniformity would not be significantly impaired if the number of cases not preempted, like those involving willful misconduct, was slightly enlarged to encompass those relatively rare cases in which the injury resulted from neither an accident nor a willful wrong. That the interest in uniformity is accommodated in one category of cases but not the other simply raises, without resolving, the question whether the drafters of the treaty intended to treat personal injury nonaccident cases as though they involved accidents. A plaintiff in such a case, unlike those injured by an accident, receives no benefit from the treaty, and normally should not have a claim that is valid under local law preempted, unless the treaty expressly requires that result.6</p><p>6 The Convention does require such a result, for example, in the case of accidents resulting in no physical injury. I agree with the Court that, in that case, the victim\'s remedies under local law are preempted by Article 24. See <i>Eastern Airlines, Inc. </i>v. <i>Floyd, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/530/case.html">499 U. S. 530</a>, 552 (1991). My interpretation does not, therefore, produce the anomaly identified <i>ante, </i>at 171. Since I believe that all personal injuries (whether physical or</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="181">181</a></p><p>Everyone agrees that the literal text of the treaty does not preempt claims of personal injury that do not arise out of an accident. It is equally clear that nothing in the drafting history requires that result. On the contrary, the amendment to the title of the Convention made in response to the proposal advanced by the Czechoslovak delegation, see <i>ante, </i>at 173, suggests that the parties assumed that local law would apply to all nonaccident cases. I agree with the Court that that inference is not strong enough, in itself, to require that the ambiguity be resolved in the plaintiff\'s favor. It suffices for me, however, that the history is just as ambiguous as the text. I firmly believe that a treaty, like an Act of Congress, should not be construed to preempt state law unless its intent to do so is clear. See <i>Medtronic, Inc. </i>v. <i>Lohr, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/case.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1996); <i>Department of Revenue of Ore. </i>v. <i>ACF Industries, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/510/332/case.html">510 U.
