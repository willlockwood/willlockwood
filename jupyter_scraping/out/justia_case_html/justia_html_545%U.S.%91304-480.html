GROKSTER, LTD., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93480.Argued March 29, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 27, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent companies distribute free software that allows computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because the computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  Although such networks can be used to share any type of digital file, recipients of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 software have mostly used them to share copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  Seeking damages and an injunction, a group of movie studios and other copyright holders (hereinafter MGM) sued respondents for their users\xe2\x80\x99 copyright infringements, alleging that respondents knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to infringe copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discovery revealed that billions of files are shared across peer-to-peer networks each month.  Respondents are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, although the decentralized networks do not reveal which files are copied, and when.  Respondents have sometimes learned about the infringement directly when users have e-mailed questions regarding copyrighted works, and respondents have replied with guidance.  Respondents are not merely passive recipients of information about infringement.  The record is replete with evidence that when they began to distribute their free software, each of them clearly voiced the objective that recipients use the software to download copyrighted works and took active steps to encourage infringement.  After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitating copyright infringement, both respondents promoted and marketed themselves as Napster alternatives.  They receive no revenue from users, but, instead, generate income by selling advertising space, then streaming the advertising to their users.  As the number of users increases, advertising opportunities are worth more.  There is no evidence that either respondent made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users\xe2\x80\x99 downloads or otherwise to impede the sharing of copyrighted files.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While acknowledging that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 users had directly infringed MGM\xe2\x80\x99s copyrights, the District Court nonetheless granted respondents summary judgment as to liability arising from distribution of their software.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It read <em>Sony Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/417/index.html">464 U. S. 417</a>, as holding that the distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  Because the appeals court found respondents\xe2\x80\x99 software to be capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the software\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized architecture, the court held that they were not liable.  It also held that they did not materially contribute to their users\xe2\x80\x99 infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing the software in the first place.  Finally, the court held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the software\xe2\x80\x99s use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device\xe2\x80\x99s lawful uses.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The tension between the competing values of supporting creativity through copyright protection and promoting technological innovation by limiting infringement liability is the subject of this case.  Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents\xe2\x80\x99 software.  When a widely shared product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the device\xe2\x80\x99s distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.  One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it.  Although \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [another\xe2\x80\x99s] infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sony, </em>464 U. S.<em>, </em>at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 486.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Sony</em> addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, copyright holders sued Sony, the manufacturer of videocassette recorders, claiming that it was contributorily liable for the infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs.  The evidence showed that the VCR\xe2\x80\x99s principal use was \xe2\x80\x9ctime-shifting,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, noninfringing use.  464 U. S., at 423\xe2\x80\x93424.  Moreover, there was no evidence that Sony had desired to bring about taping in violation of copyright or taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  <em>Id.</em>, at 438.  On those facts, the only conceivable basis for liability was on a theory of contributory infringement through distribution of a product.  <em>Id.</em>, at 439.  Because the VCR was \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of commercially significant noninfringing uses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that Sony was not liable.  <em>Id.,</em> at 442.  This theory reflected patent law\xe2\x80\x99s traditional staple article of commerce doctrine that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C \xc2\xa7271(c).  The doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with lawful and unlawful uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault.  In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread <em>Sony </em>to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third parties\xe2\x80\x99 infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement and failed to act upon that information.  <em>Sony</em> did not displace other secondary liability theories.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Nothing in <em>Sony</em> requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists.  It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.  464 U. S., at 439.  Where evidence goes beyond a product\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s staple-article rule will not preclude liability.  At common law a copyright or patent defendant who \xe2\x80\x9cnot only expected but invoked [infringing use] by advertisement\xe2\x80\x9d was liable for infringement.  <em>Kalem Co.</em> v. <em>Harper Brothers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/222/55/index.html">222 U. S. 55</a>, 62\xe2\x80\x9363.  The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today.  Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct infringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, shows an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and overcomes the law\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.  A rule that premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9320. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0On the record presented, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 unlawful objective is unmistakable.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM argues persuasively that such a message is shown here.  Three features of the evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to supply services to former Napster users indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent to bring about infringement.  Second, neither respondent attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrelevant because respondents lacked an independent duty to monitor their users\xe2\x80\x99 activity, this evidence underscores their intentional facilitation of their users\xe2\x80\x99 infringement.  Third, respondents make money by selling advertising space, then by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  The more their software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue.  Since the extent of the software\xe2\x80\x99s use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but its import is clear in the entire record\xe2\x80\x99s context.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  There is evidence of such infringement on a gigantic scale.  Because substantial evidence supports MGM on all elements, summary judgment for respondents was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGM\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion will be in order.

We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users\xe2\x80\x99 computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users\xe2\x80\x99 computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users\xe2\x80\x99 copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act, 17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 <em>et seq</em>. (2000 ed. and Supp. II).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  MGM sought damages and an injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the user\xe2\x80\x99s request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers\xe2\x80\x99 computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for quantification, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGM\xe2\x80\x99s evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users\xe2\x80\x99 downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n.\xc2\xa06, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users\xe2\x80\x99 infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  App. 559\xe2\x80\x93563, 808\xe2\x80\x93816, 939\xe2\x80\x93954.  And MGM notified the companies of 8 million copyrighted files that could be obtained using their software.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement, <em>A &amp; M Records, Inc.</em> v. <em>Napster, Inc.</em>, 114 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), aff\xe2\x80\x99d in part, rev\xe2\x80\x99d in part, 239 F.\xc2\xa03d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users\xe2\x80\x99 computers.  Evidence indicates that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t was always [StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s] intent to use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to them,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to leverage Napster\xe2\x80\x99s 50 million user base,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 746.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program and the number of music files they downloaded.  <em>Id.</em>, at 859, 863, 866.  It also used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 861, 867, 1039.  Internal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster.  <em>Id.</em>, at 861.  A kit developed by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press articles about StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s potential to capture former Napster users, <em>id.</em>, at 568\xe2\x80\x93572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is similar to what Napster was,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 884.  It broadcast banner advertisements to users of other Napster-compatible software, urging them to adopt its OpenNap.  <em>Id.</em>, at 586.  An internal e-mail from a company executive stated: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We have put this network in place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service \xe2\x80\xa6 or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that \xe2\x80\xa6 we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alternative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 588\xe2\x80\x93589, 861.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its service as the best Napster alternative.  One proposed advertisement read: \xe2\x80\x9cNapster Inc. has announced that it will soon begin charging you a fee.  That\xe2\x80\x99s if the courts don\xe2\x80\x99t order it shut down first.  What will you do to get around it?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 897.  Another proposed ad touted StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s software as the \xe2\x80\x9c#1 alternative to Napster\xe2\x80\x9d and asked \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the lights went off at Napster \xe2\x80\xa6 where did the users go?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 836 (ellipsis in original).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network, the chief technology officer of the company averred that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to get in the new[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 916.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for \xe2\x80\x9cNapster\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ree filesharing\xe2\x80\x9d would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software.  <em>Id.</em>, at 992\xe2\x80\x93993.  And Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s name is an apparent derivative of Napster.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s executives monitored the number of songs by certain commercial artists available on their networks, and an internal communication indicates they aimed to have a larger number of copyrighted songs available on their networks than other file-sharing networks.  <em>Id</em>., at 868.  The point, of course, would be to attract users of a mind to infringe, just as it would be with their promotional materials developed showing copyrighted songs as examples of the kinds of files available through Morpheus.  <em>Id</em>., at 848.  Morpheus in fact allowed users to search specifically for \xe2\x80\x9cTop 40\xe2\x80\x9d songs, <em>id.</em>, at 735, which were inevitably copyrighted.  Similarly, Grokster sent users a newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular, popular copyrighted materials.  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users\xe2\x80\x99 downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files.  <em>Id.</em>, at 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  StreamCast not only rejected another company\xe2\x80\x99s offer of help to monitor infringement, <em>id.</em>, at 928\xe2\x80\x93929, but blocked the Internet Protocol addresses of entities it believed were trying to engage in such monitoring on its networks, <em>id.</em>, at 917\xe2\x80\x93922.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable \xe2\x80\x9cfor damages arising from <em>past</em> versions of their software, or from other past activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  259 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGM\xe2\x80\x99s copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.  Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read <em>Sony Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/417/index.html"></a><a href="/us/464/417/index.html">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984), as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users\xe2\x80\x99 infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.  We granted certiorari.  543 U.

The more artistic protection is favored, the more technological innovation may be discouraged; the administration of copyright law is an exercise in managing the trade-off.  See <em>Sony Corp.</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 442; see generally Ginsburg, Copyright and Control Over New Technologies of Dissemination, 101 Colum.

J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Tech. 395 (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the software\xe2\x80\x99s use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705\xe2\x80\x93717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and Napster\xe2\x80\x99s is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Law, 89 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 679, 724\xe2\x80\x93726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, Lemley &amp; Reese, Reducing Digital Copyright Infringement Without Restricting Innovation, 56 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1345, 1386\xe2\x80\x931390 (2004); Brief for Innovation Scholars and Economists as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15\xe2\x80\x9320; Brief for Emerging Technology Companies as<em> Amici Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9325; Brief for Intel Corporation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9322.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s and Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

In <em>Sony Corp. </em>v. <em>Universal City Studios</em>, <em>supra</em>, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98time-shifting,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  <em>Id.</em>, at 423\xe2\x80\x93424.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  <em>Id.</em>, at 438.  Although Sony\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98record favorite shows\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98build a library\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of recorded programs, <em>id.</em>, at 459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), neither of these uses was necessarily infringing, <em>id.</em>, at 424, 454\xe2\x80\x93455.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe.  <em>Id.</em>, at 439.  But because the VCR was \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of commercially significant noninfringing uses,\xe2\x80\x9d we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distribution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 442.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This analysis reflected patent law\xe2\x80\x99s traditional staple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(c); <em>Aro Mfg. Co.</em> v. <em>Convertible Top Replacement Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/476/index.html">377 U. S. 476</a>, 485 (1964) (noting codification of cases); <em>id.</em>, at 486, n.\xc2\xa06 (same).  The doctrine was devised to identify instances in which it may be presumed from distribution of an article in commerce that the distributor intended the article to be used to infringe another\xe2\x80\x99s patent, and so may justly be held liable for that infringement.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne who makes and sells articles which are only adapted to be used in a patented combination will be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts; he will be presumed to intend that they shall be used in the combination of the patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New York Scaffolding Co.</em> v. <em>Whitney</em>, 224 F. 452, 459 (CA8 1915); see also <em>James Heekin Co.</em> v. <em>Baker</em>, 138 F. 63, 66 (CA8 1905); <em>Canda</em> v. <em>Michigan Malleable Iron Co.</em>, 124 F. 486, 489 (CA6 1903); <em>Thomson-Houston Electric Co.</em> v. <em>Ohio Brass Co.</em>, 80 F. 712, 720\xe2\x80\x93721 (CA6 1897); <em>Red Jacket Mfg.

Dick Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/224/1/index.html">224 U. S. 1</a>, 48 (1912), overruled on other grounds, <em>Motion Picture Patents Co.</em> v. <em>Universal Film Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/243/502/index.html">243 U. S. 502</a> (1917).  Conversely, the doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with substantial lawful as well as unlawful uses, and limits liability to instances of more acute fault than the mere understanding that some of one\xe2\x80\x99s products will be misused.  It leaves breathing room for innovation and a vigorous commerce.  See <em>Sony Corp.</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, supra</em>, at 442; <em>Dawson Chemical Co.</em> v. <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/176/index.html">448 U. S. 176</a>, 221 (1980); <em>Henry</em> v. <em>A.\xc2\xa0B. Dick Co., supra</em>, at 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties and many of the <em>amici</em> in this case think the key to resolving it is the <em>Sony</em> rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Sony Corp.</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used \xe2\x80\x9cprincipally\xe2\x80\x9d for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied <em>Sony</em>, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  <em>Sony</em> barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties\xe2\x80\x99 infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had \xe2\x80\x9cspecific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of <em>Sony</em> that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This view of <em>Sony</em>, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because <em>Sony</em> did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGM\xe2\x80\x99s inducement claim, we  do not revisit <em>Sony</em> further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of <em>Sony</em> and to leave further consideration of the <em>Sony</em> rule for a day when that may be required.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule limits imputing culpable intent as a matter of law from the characteristics or uses of a distributed product.  But nothing in <em>Sony</em> requires courts to ignore evidence of intent if there is such evidence, and the case was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>Sony Corp. </em>v. <em>Universal City Studios,</em> 464 U. S., at 439 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf vicarious liability is to be imposed on Sony in this case, it must rest on the fact that it has sold equipment with constructive knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d of the potential for infringement).  Thus, where evidence goes beyond a product\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s staple-article rule will not preclude liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The classic case of direct evidence of unlawful purpose occurs when one induces commission of infringement by another, or \xe2\x80\x9centic[es] or persuad[es] another\xe2\x80\x9d to infringe, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 790 (8th ed. 2004), as by advertising.  Thus at common law a copyright or patent defendant who \xe2\x80\x9cnot only expected but invoked [infringing use] by advertisement\xe2\x80\x9d was liable for infringement \xe2\x80\x9con principles recognized in every part of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kalem Co.</em> v. <em>Harper Brothers</em>, 222 U.

Cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 37 (5th ed. 1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a definite tendency to impose greater responsibility upon a defendant whose conduct was intended to do harm, or was morally wrong\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reasons that <em>Sony</em> took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as <em>Sony</em> did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n.\xc2\xa019, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only apparent question about treating MGM\xe2\x80\x99s evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGM\xe2\x80\x99s part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its software\xe2\x80\x99s ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the lights went off at Napster \xe2\x80\xa6 where did the users go?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See <em>supra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in <em>Sony</em>, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its software\xe2\x80\x99s function is likewise comparable to Napster\xe2\x80\x99s, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGM\xe2\x80\x99s showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users\xe2\x80\x99 activity, we think this evidence underscores Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s intentional facilitation of their users\xe2\x80\x99 infringement.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the software\xe2\x80\x99s use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unlawful objective is unmistakable.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGM\xe2\x80\x99s showing on this point in order to survive the companies\xe2\x80\x99 summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, this case is significantly different from <em>Sony</em> and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error.  <em>Sony</em> dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the product\xe2\x80\x99s capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MGM\xe2\x80\x99s evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is substantial evidence in MGM\xe2\x80\x99s favor on all elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGM\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment will be in order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.

[R]easoned analysis of [the <em>Sony</em> plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 contributory infringement claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties \xe2\x80\xa6 rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 435, n.\xc2\xa017 (quoting <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.</em> v. <em>Sony Corp.</em>, 480 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 429, 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>H. L.

This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.

Relying on its earlier opinion in <em>A&amp;M Records, Inc.</em> v. <em>Napster, Inc.</em>, 239 F.\xc2\xa03d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that \xe2\x80\x9cif substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  \xe2\x80\x9cA careful examination of the record,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cindicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s software.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although it acknowledged MGM\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s proffered evidence met <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that \xe2\x80\x9ca product need only be <em>capable</em> of substantial noninfringing uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1162.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case differs markedly from <em>Sony</em>.

Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.

These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s software for infringement.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\nEven if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s and StreamCast\xe2\x80\x99s products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936; App. 434\xe2\x80\x93439, 476\xe2\x80\x93481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, <em>ante, </em>at 8\xe2\x80\x939; 259 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1043\xe2\x80\x931044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the Court of Appeals, I would emphasize, should reconsider, on a fuller record, its interpretation of <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s product distribution holding.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer finds in <em>Sony Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/417/index.html"></a><a href="/us/464/417/index.html"></a><a href="/us/464/417/index.html">464 U.

I write to explain why I disagree with them on this matter.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Sony </em>and<em> </em>the record evidence (as described and analyzed in the many briefs before us) together convince me that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion has adequate legal support.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin with <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard.  In <em>Sony</em>,<em> </em>the Court<em> </em>considered the potential copyright liability of a company that did not itself illegally copy protected material, but rather sold a machine\xe2\x80\x94a Video Cassette Recorder (VCR)\xe2\x80\x94that could be used to do so.  A buyer could use that machine for <em>non</em>infringing purposes, such as recording for later viewing (sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98time-shifting,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sony</em>, 464 U. S.<em>,</em> at 421) uncopyrighted television programs or copyrighted programs with a copyright holder\xe2\x80\x99s permission.  The buyer could use the machine for infringing purposes as well, such as building libraries of taped copyrighted programs.  Or, the buyer might use the machine to record copyrighted programs under circumstances in which the legal status of the act of recording was uncertain (<em>i.e.</em>, where the copying may, or may not, have constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cfair use,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 425\xe2\x80\x93426).  Sony knew many customers would use its VCRs to engage in unauthorized copying and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98library-building.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  But that fact, said the Court, was insufficient to make Sony itself an infringer.  And the Court ultimately held that Sony<em> </em>was not liable for its customers\xe2\x80\x99 acts of infringement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized the need for the law, in fixing <em>secondary</em> copyright liability, to \xe2\x80\x9cstrike a balance between a copyright holder\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate demand for effective\xe2\x80\x94not merely symbolic\xe2\x80\x94protection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 442.  It pointed to patent law\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstaple article of commerce\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, <em>ibid.</em>, under which a distributor of a product is not liable for patent infringement by its customers unless that product is \xe2\x80\x9cunsuited for any commercial noninfringing use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dawson Chemical Co.</em> v. <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/176/index.html">448 U. S. 176</a>, 198 (1980).  The Court wrote that the sale of copying equipment, \xe2\x80\x9clike the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  <em>Indeed</em>, <em>it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sony</em>, 464 U. S.,<em> </em>at 442 (emphasis added).  The<em> </em>Court ultimately characterized the legal \xe2\x80\x9cquestion\xe2\x80\x9d in the particular case as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [Sony\xe2\x80\x99s VCR] is <em>capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (while declining to give \xe2\x80\x9cprecise content\xe2\x80\x9d to these terms).  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It then applied this standard.  The Court had before it a survey (commissioned by the District Court and then prepared by the respondents) showing that roughly 9% of all VCR recordings were of the type\xe2\x80\x94namely, religious, educational, and sports programming\xe2\x80\x94owned by producers and distributors testifying on Sony\xe2\x80\x99s behalf who did not object to time-shifting.  See Brief for Respondent Universal Studios et\xc2\xa0al. O.\xc2\xa0T. 1983, No. 81\xe2\x80\x931687, pp. 52\xe2\x80\x9353; see also <em>Sony</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 424 (7.3% of all Sony VCR use is to record sports programs; representatives of the sports leagues do not object).  A much higher percentage of VCR <em>users</em> had at one point taped an authorized program, in addition to taping unauthorized programs.  And the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94not a large class of content providers as in this case\xe2\x80\x94owned only a small percentage of the total available <em>un</em>authorized programming.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, and n.\xc2\xa03 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  But of all the taping actually done by Sony\xe2\x80\x99s customers, only around 9% was of the sort the Court referred to as authorized.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court found that the magnitude of authorized programming was \xe2\x80\x9csignificant,\xe2\x80\x9d and it also noted the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant potential for future authorized copying.\xe2\x80\x9d  464 U. S., at 444.  The Court supported this conclusion by referencing the trial testimony of professional sports league officials and a religious broadcasting representative.  <em>Id</em>., at 444, and n. 24.  It also discussed (1) a Los Angeles educational station affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service that made many of its programs available for home taping, and (2) Mr. Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 Neighborhood, a widely watched children\xe2\x80\x99s program.  <em>Id</em>., at 445.  On the basis of this testimony and other similar evidence, the Court determined that producers of this kind had authorized duplication of their copyrighted programs \xe2\x80\x9cin significant enough numbers to create a <em>substantial</em> market for a noninfringing use of the\xe2\x80\x9d VCR.  <em>Id</em>., at 447, n. 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, in using the key word \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d indicated that these circumstances alone constituted a sufficient basis for rejecting the imposition of secondary liability.  See <em>id</em>., at 456 (\xe2\x80\x9cSony demonstrated a significant likelihood that <em>substantial </em>numbers of copyright holders\xe2\x80\x9d would not object to time-shifting (emphasis added)).  Nonetheless, the Court buttressed its conclusion by finding separately that, in any event, <em>un</em>authorized time- shifting often constituted not infringement, but \xe2\x80\x9cfair use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 447\xe2\x80\x93456.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When measured against <em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>underlying evidence and<em> </em>analysis, the evidence now before us shows that Grokster passes <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the company\xe2\x80\x99s product is capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.<em>  Id</em>., at 442.  For one thing, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 (hereinafter MGM) own expert declared that 75% of current<em> </em>files available on Grokster are infringing and 15% are \xe2\x80\x9clikely infringing.\xe2\x80\x9d  See App. 436\xe2\x80\x93439, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb66\xe2\x80\x9317 (Decl. of Dr. Ingram Olkin); cf. <em>ante</em>, at 4 (opinion of the Court).  That leaves some number of files near 10% that apparently are noninfringing, a figure very similar to the 9% or so of authorized time-shifting uses of the VCR that the Court faced in <em>Sony</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Sony,</em> witnesses here explained the nature of the noninfringing files on Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s network without detailed quantification.  Those files include: </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Authorized copies of music by artists such as Wilco, Janis Ian, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, John Mayer, and others.  See App. at 152\xe2\x80\x93153, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb69\xe2\x80\x9313 (Decl. of Aram Sinnreich) (Wilco\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clesson has already been adopted by artists still signed to their major labels\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 170, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb65\xe2\x80\x937 (Decl. of Patricia D.

Mayers)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The nature of these and other lawfully swapped files is such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of current lawful use roughly approximate to those at issue in <em>Sony.</em>  At least, MGM has offered no evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment that could plausibly demonstrate a significant quantitative difference.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4 (opinion of the Court); see also Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners i (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cat least 90% of the total use of the services\xe2\x80\x9d); but see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa03 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  To be sure, in quantitative terms these uses account for only a small percentage of the total number of uses of Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s product.  But the same was true in <em>Sony</em>, which characterized the relatively limited authorized copying market as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  (The Court made clear as well in <em>Sony</em> that the amount of material then presently available for lawful copying\xe2\x80\x94if not actually copied\xe2\x80\x94was significant, see 464 U. S., at 444, and the same is certainly true in this case.)  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Importantly, <em>Sony </em>also used the word \xe2\x80\x9ccapable,\xe2\x80\x9d asking whether the product is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>capable of</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>substantial noninfringing uses.  Its language and analysis suggest that a figure like 10%, if fixed for all time, might well prove insufficient, but that such a figure serves as an adequate foundation where there is a reasonable prospect of expanded legitimate uses over time.  See <em>ibid</em>. (noting a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant potential for future authorized copying\xe2\x80\x9d).  And its language also indicates the appropriateness of looking to potential future uses of the product to determine its \xe2\x80\x9ccapability.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the record reveals a significant future market for noninfringing uses of Grokster-type peer-to-peer software.  Such software permits the exchange of <em>any </em>sort of digital file\xe2\x80\x94whether that file does, or does not, contain copyrighted material.  As more and more uncopyrighted information is stored in swappable form, it seems a likely inference that lawful peer-to-peer sharing will become increasingly prevalent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 142, \xc2\xb620 (Decl. of Brewster Kahle) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe [Internet Archive] welcomes [the] redistribution [of authorized films] by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 166, \xc2\xb68 (Decl. of Busher) (sales figures of $1,000 to $10,000 per month through peer-to-peer networks \xe2\x80\x9cwill increase in the future as Acoustica\xe2\x80\x99s trialware is more widely distributed through these networks\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 156\xe2\x80\x93164, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb621\xe2\x80\x9340 (Decl. of Sinnreich).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that is just what is happening.  Such legitimate noninfringing uses are coming to include the swapping of: <em>research information</em> (the initial purpose of many peer-to-peer networks); <em>public domain films </em>(<em>e.g.</em>, those owned by the Prelinger Archive); <em>historical recordings and digital educational materials</em> (<em>e.g.</em>, those stored on the Internet Archive); <em>digital photos</em> (OurPictures, for example, is starting a P2P photo-swapping service); \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shareware\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfreeware\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (<em>e.g.</em>, Linux and certain Windows software); <em>secure licensed music and movie files</em> (Intent MediaWorks, for example, protects licensed content sent across P2P networks); <em>news broadcasts past and present</em> (the BBC Creative Archive lets users \xe2\x80\x9crip, mix and share the BBC\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>user-created audio and video files</em> (including \xe2\x80\x9cpodcasts\xe2\x80\x9d that may be distributed through P2P software); <em>and all manner of free \xe2\x80\x9copen content\xe2\x80\x9d works collected by Creative Commons</em> (one can search for Creative Commons material on StreamCast).  See Brief for Distributed Computing Industry Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15\xe2\x80\x9326; Merges, A New Dynamism in the Public Domain, 71 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 183 (2004).  I can find nothing in the record that suggests that this course of events will <em>not </em>continue to flow naturally as a consequence of the character of the software taken together with the foreseeable development of the Internet and of information technology.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the significant benefits of peer-to-peer technology).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There may be other now-unforeseen noninfringing uses that develop for peer-to-peer software, just as the home-video rental industry (unmentioned in <em>Sony</em>) developed for the VCR.  But the foreseeable development of such uses, when taken together with an estimated 10% noninfringing material, is sufficient to meet <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard.  And while <em>Sony </em>considered the record following a trial, there are no facts asserted by MGM in its summary judgment filings that lead me to believe the outcome after a trial here could be any different.  The lower courts reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, Grokster itself may not want to develop these other noninfringing uses.  But <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard seeks to protect not the Groksters of this world (which in any event may well be liable under today\xe2\x80\x99s holding), but the development of technology more generally.  And Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s desires in this respect are beside the point.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The real question here, I believe, is not whether the record evidence satisfies <em>Sony.</em>  As I have interpreted the standard set forth in that case, it does.  And of the Courts of Appeals that have considered the matter, only one has proposed interpreting <em>Sony </em>more strictly than I would do\xe2\x80\x94in a case where the product might have failed under <em>any </em>standard.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Aimster Copyright Litigation</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 643, 653 (CA7 2003) (defendant \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to show that its service is <em>ever </em>used for any purpose other than to infringe\xe2\x80\x9d copyrights (emphasis added)); see <em>Matthew Bender &amp; Co.</em>, <em>Inc.</em> v. <em>West Pub.

Compare <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x938 (concurring) (insufficient evidence in this case of both present lawful uses and of a reasonable prospect that substantial noninfringing uses would develop over time), with <em>Sony</em>, 464 U. S., at 442\xe2\x80\x93447 (basing conclusion as to the likely existence of a substantial market for authorized copying upon general declarations, some survey data, and common sense).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have said, <em>Sony </em>itself sought to \xe2\x80\x9cstrike a balance between a copyright holder\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate demand for effective\xe2\x80\x94not merely symbolic\xe2\x80\x94protection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 442.  Thus, to determine whether modification, or a strict interpretation, of <em>Sony</em> is needed, I would ask whether MGM has shown that <em>Sony </em>incorrectly balanced copyright and new-technology interests.  In particular: (1) Has <em>Sony</em> (as I interpret it) worked to protect new technology?  (2) If so, would modification or strict interpretation significantly weaken that protection?  (3) If so, would new or necessary copyright-related benefits outweigh any such weakening?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first question is the easiest to answer.  <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>rule, as I interpret it, has provided entrepreneurs with needed assurance that they will be shielded from copyright liability as they bring valuable new technologies to market.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99s rule is clear. </em>That clarity allows those who develop new products that are capable of substantial noninfringing uses to know, <em>ex ante</em>, that distribution of their product will not yield massive monetary liability.  At the same time, it helps deter them from distributing products that have no other real function than\xe2\x80\x94or that are specifically intended for\xe2\x80\x94copyright infringement, deterrence that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today reinforces (by adding a weapon to the copyright holder\xe2\x80\x99s legal arsenal).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99s rule is strongly technology protecting</em>.  The rule<em> </em>deliberately makes it difficult for courts to find secondary liability where new technology is at issue.  It establishes that the law will not impose copyright liability upon the distributors of dual-use technologies (who do not themselves engage in unauthorized copying) unless the product in question will be used <em>almost exclusively</em> to infringe copyrights (or unless they actively induce infringements as we today describe). <em>Sony </em>thereby recognizes that the copyright laws are not intended to discourage or to control the emergence of new technologies, including (perhaps especially) those that help disseminate information and ideas more broadly or more efficiently.  Thus <em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99</em>s rule shelters VCRs, typewriters, tape recorders, photocopiers, computers, cassette players, compact disc burners, digital video recorders, MP3 players, Internet search engines, and peer-to-peer software.  But <em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99</em>s rule does not shelter descramblers, even if one could <em>theoretically </em>use a descrambler in a noninfringing way.  464 U. S., at 441\xe2\x80\x93442; Compare <em>Cable/Home Communication Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 837\xe2\x80\x93850 (developer liable for advertising television signal descrambler), with <em>Vault Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 262<em> </em>(primary use infringing but a substantial noninfringing use).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99s rule</em> <em>is forward looking</em>.  It does not confine its scope to a static snapshot of a product\xe2\x80\x99s current uses (thereby threatening technologies that have undeveloped future markets).  Rather, as the VCR example makes clear, a product\xe2\x80\x99s market can evolve dramatically over time.  And <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x94by referring to a <em>capacity</em> for substantial noninfringing uses\xe2\x80\x94recognizes that fact.  <em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99</em>s word \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a plausible<em>,</em> not simply a theoretical, likelihood that such uses will come to pass, and that fact anchors <em>Sony </em>in practical reality.  Cf. <em>Aimster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 651. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sony\xe2\x80\x99s rule is mindful of the limitations facing judges where matters of technology are concerned</em>.<em> </em>Judges have no specialized technical ability to answer questions about present or future technological feasibilility or commercial viability where technology professionals, engineers, and venture capitalists themselves may radically disagree and where answers may differ depending upon whether one focuses upon the time of product development or the time of distribution.  Consider, for example, the question whether devices can be added to Grokster\xe2\x80\x99s software that will filter out infringing files.  MGM tells us this is easy enough to do, as do several <em>amici</em> that produce and sell the filtering technology.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Motion Picture Studio Petitioners 11; Brief for Audible Magic Corp. et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3\xe2\x80\x9310.  Grokster says it is not at all easy to do, and not an efficient solution in any event, and several apparently disinterested computer science professors agree.  See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for<em> </em>Computer Science Professors as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x9310, 14\xe2\x80\x9318.  Which account should a judge credit?  <em>Sony </em>says that the judge will not necessarily have to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the nature of the <em>Sony </em>rule, it is not surprising that in the last 20 years, there have been relatively few contributory infringement suits\xe2\x80\x94based on a product distribution theory\xe2\x80\x94brought against technology providers (a small handful of federal appellate court cases and perhaps fewer than two dozen District Court cases in the last 20 years).  I have found nothing in the briefs or the record that shows that <em>Sony </em>has failed to achieve its innovation-protecting objective.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second, more difficult, question is whether a modified <em>Sony </em>rule (or a strict interpretation) would significantly weaken the law\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect new technology. Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s approach would require defendants to produce considerably more concrete evidence\xe2\x80\x94more than was presented here\xe2\x80\x94to earn <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>shelter.  That heavier evidentiary demand, and especially the more dramatic (case-by-case balancing) modifications that MGM and the Government seek, would, I believe, undercut the protection that <em>Sony </em>now offers. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To require defendants to provide, for example, detailed evidence\xe2\x80\x94say business plans, profitability estimates, projected technological modifications, and so forth\xe2\x80\x94would doubtless make life easier for copyrightholder plaintiffs.  But it would simultaneously increase the legal uncertainty that surrounds the creation or development of a new technology capable of being put to infringing uses.  Inventors and entrepreneurs (in the garage, the dorm room, the corporate lab, or the boardroom) would have to fear (and in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials when they create, produce, or distribute the sort of information technology that can be used for copyright infringement.  They would often be left guessing as to how a court, upon later review of the product and its uses, would decide when necessarily rough estimates amounted to sufficient evidence.  They would have no way to predict how courts would weigh the respective values of infringing and noninfringing uses; determine the efficiency and advisability of technological changes; or assess a product\xe2\x80\x99s potential future markets.  The price of a wrong guess\xe2\x80\x94even if it involves a good-faith effort to assess technical and commercial viability\xe2\x80\x94could be large statutory damages (not less than $750 and up to $30,000 <em>per infringed work</em>).  17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(c)(1).  The additional risk and uncertainty would mean a consequent additional chill of technological development.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third question\xe2\x80\x94whether a positive copyright impact would outweigh any technology-related loss\xe2\x80\x94I find the most difficult of the three.  I do not doubt that a more intrusive <em>Sony </em>test would generally provide greater revenue security for copyright holders. But it is harder to conclude that the gains on the copyright swings would exceed the losses on the technology roundabouts.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the law disfavors equating the two different kinds of gain and loss; rather, it leans in favor of protecting technology.  As <em>Sony</em> itself<em> </em>makes clear, the producer of a technology which <em>permits </em>unlawful copying does not himself <em>engage</em> in unlawful copying\xe2\x80\x94a fact that makes the attachment of copyright liability to the creation, production, or distribution of the technology an exceptional thing.  See 464 U. S., at 431 (courts \xe2\x80\x9cmust be circumspect\xe2\x80\x9d in construing the copyright laws to preclude distribution of new technologies).  Moreover, <em>Sony</em> has been the law for some time.  And that fact imposes a serious burden upon copyright holders like MGM to show a need for change in the current rules of the game, including a more strict interpretation of the test.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Motion Picture Studio Petitioners 31 (<em>Sony</em> should not protect products when the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary or principal\xe2\x80\x9d use is infringing).    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the evidence now available does not, in my view, make out a sufficiently strong case for change.  To say this is not to doubt the basic need to protect copyrighted material from infringement. The Constitution itself stresses the vital role that copyright plays in advancing the \xe2\x80\x9cuseful Arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 8.  No one disputes that \xe2\x80\x9creward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paramount Pictures</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/131/index.html">334 U. S. 131</a>, 158 (1948).  And deliberate unlawful copying is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.  See, <em>e.g</em>., 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72319 (criminal copyright infringement); \xc2\xa71961(1)(B) (copyright infringement can be a predicate act under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); \xc2\xa71956(c)(7)(D) (money laundering includes the receipt of proceeds from copyright infringement).  But these highly general principles cannot by themselves tell us how to balance the interests at issue in <em>Sony </em>or whether<em> Sony\xe2\x80\x99</em>s standard needs modification.  And at certain key points, information is lacking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Will an unmodified <em>Sony </em>lead to a significant diminution in the amount or quality of creative work produced?  Since copyright\xe2\x80\x99s basic objective is creation and its revenue objectives but a means to that end, this is the underlying copyright question.  See <em>Twentieth Century Music Corp.</em> v. <em>Aiken</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/151/index.html">422 U. S. 151</a>, 156 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9cCreative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts\xe2\x80\x9d).  And its answer is far from clear.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unauthorized copying likely diminishes industry\nrevenue, though it is not clear by how much.  Compare\nS. Liebowitz, Will MP3 Downloads Annihilate the\nRecord Industry?

See, <em>e.g</em>., M. Madden, Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, Artists, Musicians, and the Internet, p. 21, http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Artists.Musicians_\nReport.pdf (nearly 70% of musicians believe that file sharing is a minor threat or no threat at all to creative industries); Benkler, Sharing Nicely: On Shareable Goods and the Emergence of Sharing as a Modality of Economic Production, 114 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 273, 351\xe2\x80\x93352 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of the actual flow of revenue to artists\xe2\x80\x94from performances and other sources\xe2\x80\x94is stable even assuming a complete displacement of the CD market by peer-to-peer distribution \xe2\x80\xa6 .

As today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion makes clear, a copyright holder may proceed against a technology provider where a provable specific intent to infringe (of the kind the Court describes) is present.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24 (opinion of the Court).  Services like Grokster may well be liable under an inducement theory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, a copyright holder has always had the legal authority to bring a traditional infringement suit against one who wrongfully copies.  Indeed, since September 2003, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has filed \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of suits against people for sharing copyrighted material.\xe2\x80\x9d  Walker, New Movement Hits Universities: Get Legal Music, Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2005, p.\xc2\xa0E1.  These suits have provided copyright holders with damages; have served as a teaching tool, making clear that much file sharing, if done without permission, is unlawful; and apparently have had a real and significant deterrent effect.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, L. Rainie, M. Madden, D. Hess, &amp; G. Mudd, Pew Internet Project and comScore Media Metrix Data Memo: The state of music downloading\nand file-sharing online, pp. 2, 4, 6, 10 (Apr. 2004), www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Filesharing_April_04.pdf (number of people downloading files fell from a peak of roughly 35 million to roughly 23 million in the year following the first suits; 38% of current downloaders report downloading fewer files because of the suits); M.

Several services now sell music for less than $1 per song.  (Walmart.com, for example, charges $0.88 each).  Consequently, many consumers initially attracted to the convenience and flexibility of services like Grokster are now migrating to lawful paid services (services with copying permission) where they can enjoy at little cost even greater convenience and flexibility without engaging in unlawful swapping.

See Brief for Internet Law Faculty as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5\xe2\x80\x9320; Bruno, Digital Entertainment: Piracy Fight Shows Encouraging Signs (Mar. 5, 2005), available at LEXIS, News Library, Billboard File (in 2004, consumers worldwide purchased more than 10 times the number of digital tracks purchased in 2003; global digital music market of $330 million in 2004 expected to double in 2005); Press Release, Informa Media Report, <em>supra</em> (global digital revenues will likely exceed $3 billion in 2010); Ashton, [International Federation of the Phonographic Industry] Predicts Downloads Will Hit the Mainstream, Music Week, Jan. 29, 2005, p. 6 (legal music sites and portable MP3 players \xe2\x80\x9care helping transform the digital music market\xe2\x80\x9d into \xe2\x80\x9can everyday consumer experience\xe2\x80\x9d).  And more advanced types of <em>non-</em>music-oriented P2P networks have also started to develop, drawing in part on the lessons of Grokster.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, as <em>Sony </em>recognized, the legislative option remains available.  Courts are less well suited than Congress to the task of \xe2\x80\x9caccommodat[ing] fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sony</em>, 464 U. S., at 431; see, <em>e.g.</em>, Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 4237 (adding 17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C., ch. 10); Protecting Innovation and Art While Preventing Piracy: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 108th Cong., 2d Sess. (July 22, 2004). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not know whether these developments and similar alternatives will prove sufficient, but I am reasonably certain that, given their existence, a strong demonstrated need for modifying <em>Sony</em> (or for interpreting <em>Sony</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard more strictly) has not yet been shown.  That fact, along with the added risks that modification (or strict interpretation) would impose upon technological innovation, leads me to the conclusion that we should maintain <em>Sony</em>, reading its<em> </em>standard as I have read it.  As so read, it requires affirmance of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the relevant aspects of the <em>Sony </em>question. </p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I disagree with Justice Ginsburg, but I agree with the Court and join its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
