Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of jurisdiction by N.\xc2\xa0Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7901(b), which precludes a class action to recover a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d such as statutory interest.  Affirming, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.

Since \xc2\xa7901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady Grove\xe2\x80\x99s suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be maintained as a class action\xe2\x80\x9d because of the relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires.  The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa7901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues is rejected.  The line between eligibility and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23 explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case meeting its criteria.  Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s arguments based on the exclusion of some federal claims from Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s reach pursuant to federal statutes and on \xc2\xa7901\xe2\x80\x99s structure are unpersuasive.

The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072(b), does not apply because Rule 23 is clear.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach does not avoid a conflict between \xc2\xa7901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would render Rule 23 partially invalid.

Section 2072(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that federal procedural rules \xe2\x80\x9cnot abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right\xe2\x80\x9d means that a Rule must \xe2\x80\x9creally regulat[e] procedure,\xe2\x80\x94the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sibbach</em> v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/1/index.html">312 U.

Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party\xe2\x80\x99s rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies, or the rules of decision for adjudicating either.  Rule 23 satisfies that criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their separate claims against the same defendants.  Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s arguments asserting \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that matters, but that of the Federal Rule. <em> </em>See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em>, at 14.

In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied, displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right.  Examples may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of recovery.  An application of a federal rule that directly collides with such a state law violates the Rules Enabling Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x9313.  </p>\n<p>\n\n(b)\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0Y. Civ. Prac.

A., provided medical care to Sonia E. Galvez for injuries she suffered in an automobile accident.  As partial payment for that care, Galvez assigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits under a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance Co.  Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned benefits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to pay the claim or deny it.  See N.\xc2\xa0Y. Ins. Law Ann. \xc2\xa75106(a) (West 2009).  Allstate apparently paid, but not on time, and it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on the overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern District of New York to recover the unpaid statutory interest. Alleging that Allstate routinely refuses to pay interest on overdue benefits, Shady Grove sought relief on behalf of itself and a class of all others to whom Allstate owes interest. The District Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction.  466 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 467 (2006).  It reasoned that N.\xc2\xa0Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7901(b), which precludes a suit to recover a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d from proceeding as a class action, applies in diversity suits in federal court, despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Concluding that statutory interest is a \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty\xe2\x80\x9d under New York law, it held that \xc2\xa7901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.  And, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim (worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in-controversy requirement for individual suits under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit affirmed.  549 F.\xc2\xa03d 137 (2008).

But there was no conflict because (as we will describe in more detail below) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and \xc2\xa7901(b) address different issues.

Rule 23 provides an answer.  It states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] class action may be maintained\xe2\x80\x9d if two conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) (<em>i.e.</em>, numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b).  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023(b).  By its terms this creates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class action.  (The Federal Rules regularly use \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d to confer categorical permission, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 20(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), 27(a)(1), 30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural entitlements, see, <em>e.g., </em>29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7626(c)(1); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1).)  Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all formula for deciding the class-action question.  Because \xc2\xa7901(b) attempts to answer the same question\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, it states that Shady Grove\xe2\x80\x99s suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay <em>not</em> be maintained as a class action\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) because of the relief it seeks\xe2\x80\x94it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit believed that \xc2\xa7901(b) and Rule 23 do not conflict because they address different issues.  Rule 23, it said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether a given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on the other hand, addresses an antecedent question: whether the particular type of claim is eligible for class treatment in the first place\xe2\x80\x94a question on which Rule 23 is silent.  See 549 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 143\xe2\x80\x93144.  Allstate embraces this analysis.  Brief for Respondent 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  To begin with, the line between eligibility and certifiability is entirely artificial.  Both are preconditions for maintaining a class action.  Allstate suggests that eligibility must depend on the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d asserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, <em>id.</em>, at 12.  But that is not so.  Congress could, for example, provide that only claims involving more than a certain number of plaintiffs are \xe2\x80\x9celigible\xe2\x80\x9d for class treatment in federal court.  In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prerequisites \xe2\x80\x9celigibility criteria\xe2\x80\x9d would obviate Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s objection\xe2\x80\x94a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinction is made-to-order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether claims made eligible for class treatment by some <em>other</em> law should be certified as class actions.  Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly nor implicitly empowers a federal court \xe2\x80\x9cto certify a class in each and every case\xe2\x80\x9d where the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s criteria are met.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  But that is <em>exactly</em> what Rule 23 does: It says that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied \xe2\x80\x9c[a] class action <em>may be maintained</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>a class action may be permitted.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Courts do not maintain actions; litigants do.  The discretion suggested by Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring his claim in a class action if he wishes.  And like the rest of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 <em>automatically</em> applies \xe2\x80\x9cin all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa01.  See <em>Califano</em> v. <em>Yamasaki</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/682/index.html">442 U. S. 682</a>, 699\xe2\x80\x93700 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some federal claims from Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s reach, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(e)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x94which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule 23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but rather leaves room for laws like \xc2\xa7901(b).  But Congress, unlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an individual rule as it sees fit\xe2\x80\x94either by directly amending the rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in certain instances.  Cf. <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/654/index.html">517 U. S. 654</a>, 668 (1996).  The fact that Congress has created specific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule does not apply generally.  In fact, it proves the opposite<em>.</em>  If Rule 23 did <em>not</em> authorize class actions across the board, the statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allstate next suggests that the structure of \xc2\xa7901 shows that Rule 23 addresses only certifiability.  Section 901(<em>a</em>), it notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly analogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees <em>that </em>subsection is pre-empted).  But \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s rule barring class actions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection, and where it applies \xc2\xa7901(a) does not.  This shows, according to Allstate, that \xc2\xa7901(b) concerns a separate subject.  Perhaps it does concern a subject separate from the subject of \xc2\xa7901(a).  But the question before us is whether it concerns a subject separate from the subject of <em>Rule 23</em>\xe2\x80\x94and for purposes of answering <em>that</em> question the way New York has structured its statute is immaterial.  Rule 23 permits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a State cannot limit that permission by structuring one part of its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part that imposes additional requirements.  Both of \xc2\xa7901\xe2\x80\x99s subsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule 23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.  Cf. <em>Burlington</em>, 480 U. S., at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that \xc2\xa7901(b) has nothing to do with whether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class action, but affects only the <em>remedy</em> it may obtain if it wins.  See <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9317 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  Whereas \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23 governs procedural aspects of class litigation\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cprescrib[ing] the considerations relevant to class certification and postcertification proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7901(b) addresses only \xe2\x80\x9cthe size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may pursue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Accordingly, the dissent says, Rule 23 and New York\xe2\x80\x99s law may coexist in peace.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide whether a state law that limits the remedies available in an existing class action would conflict with Rule 23; that is not what \xc2\xa7901(b) does.  By its terms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a class action seeking statutory penalties. Unlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other remedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions, \xc2\xa7901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may award; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming into existence at all.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Consequently, a court bound by \xc2\xa7901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statutory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in advance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the event the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d such suits as class actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s barrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a request for statutory penalties.  See <em>post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  Even assuming all statutory penalties are waivable,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the fact that a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class action would not at all prove that \xc2\xa7901(b) is addressed only to remedies.  If the state law instead banned class actions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff could drop the fraud counts from his complaint and proceed with the remainder in a class action.  Yet that would not mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban would affect only the procedural means by which the remedy may be pursued.  In short, although the dissent correctly abandons Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility-certifiability distinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of \xc2\xa7901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether a class action may be maintained\xe2\x80\x94but insists the provision\xe2\x80\x99s <em>purpose</em> is to restrict only remedies.  See <em>post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9315; <em>post</em>, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile phrased as responsive to the question whether certain class actions may begin, \xc2\xa7901(b) is unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions must end\xe2\x80\x9d).  Unlike Rule 23, designed to further procedural fairness and efficiency, \xc2\xa7901(b) (we are told) \xe2\x80\x9cresponds to an entirely different concern\xe2\x80\x9d: the fear that allowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide basis would \xe2\x80\x9cproduce overkill.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12, 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The dissent reaches this conclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in the law\xe2\x80\x99s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the Legislature \xe2\x80\x9capparently fear[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that combining class actions and statutory penalties \xe2\x80\x9ccould result in annihilating punishment of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\xe2\x80\x99s Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); (3) a remark by the Governor in his signing statement that \xc2\xa7901(b) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0provides a controlled remedy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 9 (quoting Memorandum on Approving  L. 1975, Ch. 207, reprinted in 1975 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Laws, at 1748; emphasis deleted), and (4) a state court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the final text of \xc2\xa7901(b) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98was the result of a compromise among competing interests,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 9 (quoting <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp.</em>, 8 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This evidence of the New York Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is pretty sparse.  But even accepting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s account of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s objective at face value, it cannot override the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear text.  Even if its aim is to restrict the remedy a plaintiff can obtain, \xc2\xa7901(b) achieves that end by limiting a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s power to maintain a class action.  The manner in which the law \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been written,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legislature <em>did</em> enact.  We cannot rewrite that to reflect our perception of legislative purpose, see <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (1998).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated rather than furthered by revising state laws when a potential conflict with a Federal Rule arises; the state-friendly approach would be to accept the law as written and test the validity of the Federal Rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach of determining whether state and federal rules conflict based on the subjective intentions of the state legislature is an enterprise destined to produce \xe2\x80\x9cconfusion worse confounded,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sibbach</em> v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/312/1/index.html">312 U. S. 1</a>, 14 (1941).  It would mean, to begin with, that one State\xe2\x80\x99s statute could survive pre-emption (and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court) while another State\xe2\x80\x99s identical law would not, merely because its authors had different aspirations.  It would also mean that district courts would have to discern, in every diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively pre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely conflicts with federal law.  That task will often prove arduous.  Many laws further more than one aim, and the aim of others may be impossible to discern.  Moreover, to the extent the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s purpose-driven approach depends on its characterization of \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s aims as substantive, it would apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to procedure.  Pleading standards, for example, often embody policy preferences about the types of claims that should succeed\xe2\x80\x94as do rules governing summary judgment, pretrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.  Hard cases will abound.  It is not even clear that a state supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncement of the law\xe2\x80\x99s purpose would settle the issue, since existence of the factual predicate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a federal question.  Predictably, federal judges would be condemned to poring through state legislative history\xe2\x80\x94which may be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less familiar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky &amp; D. Dunn, Fundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Torres &amp; Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, Annotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib. J. 545, 547 (1993).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But while the dissent does indeed artificially narrow the scope of \xc2\xa7901(b) by finding that it pursues only substantive policies, that is not the central difficulty of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The central difficulty is that even artificial narrowing cannot render \xc2\xa7901(b) compatible with Rule 23.  <em>Whatever </em>the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict each other.  Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see <em>post</em>, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) <em>interpret</em> Rule 23 in a manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing statute.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings\xe2\x80\x94one that would violate \xc2\xa72072(b) and another that would not\xe2\x80\x94we would agree.  See <em>Ortiz</em> v. <em>Fibreboard Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/815/index.html">527 U. S. 815</a>, 842, 845 (1999); cf. <em>Semtek Int\xe2\x80\x99l Inc.</em> v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/497/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/497/index.html">531 U. S. 497</a>, 503\xe2\x80\x93504 (2001).  But it is not.  Rule 23 unambiguously authorizes <em>any</em> plaintiff, in <em>any</em> federal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s prerequisites are met.  We cannot contort its text, even to avert a collision with state law that might render it invalid.  See <em>Walker</em> v. <em>Armco Steel Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/740/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/740/index.html">446 U. S. 740</a>, 750, n. 9 (1980).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  What the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach achieves is not the avoiding of a \xe2\x80\x9cconflict between Rule 23 and \xc2\xa7901(b),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23 (pursuant to \xc2\xa72072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the extent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of \xc2\xa7901.  There is no other way to reach the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s destination.  We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule 23 falls within the statutory authorization.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Erie </em>involved the constitutional power of federal courts to supplant state law with judge-made rules.  In that context, it made no difference whether the rule was technically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was whether it \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/index.html">326 U. S. 99</a>, 109 (1945).  That is not the test for either the constitutionality or the statutory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure.  Congress has undoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted power to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so long as those rules regulate matters \xe2\x80\x9crationally capable of classification\xe2\x80\x9d as procedure.  <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 472.  In the Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to promulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28 U.

S., at 14; see <em>Hanna</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 464; <em>Burlington</em>, 480 U. S., at 8.  The test is not whether the rule affects a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s substantive rights; most procedural rules do.  <em>Mississippi Publishing Corp.</em> v. <em>Murphree</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/438/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/438/index.html">326 U. S. 438</a>, 445 (1946).  What matters is what the rule itself <em>regulates:</em> If it governs only \xe2\x80\x9cthe manner and the means\xe2\x80\x9d by which the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 rights are \xe2\x80\x9cenforced,\xe2\x80\x9d it is valid; if it alters \xe2\x80\x9cthe rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate [those] rights,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not.  <em>Id.</em>, at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that test, we have rejected every statutory challenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us.  We have found to be in compliance with \xc2\xa72072(b) rules prescribing methods for serving process, see <em>id.</em>, at 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa04(f)); <em>Hanna</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 463\xe2\x80\x93465 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa04(d)(1)), and requiring litigants whose mental or physical condition is in dispute to submit to examinations, see <em>Sibbach</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa035); <em>Schlagenhauf</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/104/index.html">379 U. S. 104</a>, 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (1964) (same).  Likewise, we have upheld rules authorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file frivolous appeals, see <em>Burlington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 8 (Fed. Rule App. Proc.\xc2\xa038), or who sign court papers without a reasonable inquiry into the facts asserted, see <em>Business Guides, Inc.</em> v. <em>Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/533/index.html"></a><a href="/us/498/533/index.html">498 U. S. 533</a>, 551\xe2\x80\x93554 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa011).  Each of these rules had some practical effect on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for enforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves, the available remedies, or the rules of decision by which the court adjudicated either.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules allowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multiple parties) to be litigated together are also valid.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa018 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder of parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions).  Such rules neither change plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 separate entitlements to relief nor abridge defendants\xe2\x80\x99 rights; they alter only how the claims are processed.  For the same reason, Rule 23\xe2\x80\x94at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their separate claims against the same defendants in a class action\xe2\x80\x94falls within \xc2\xa72072(b)\xe2\x80\x99s authorization.  A class action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits.  And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties\xe2\x80\x99 legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision unchanged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions is not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue on behalf of a class \xe2\x80\x9ctransform[s] [the] dispute over a five <em>hundred</em> dollar penalty into a dispute over a five <em>million</em> dollar penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 1.  Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate liability, however, does not depend on whether the suit proceeds as a class action.  Each of the 1,000-plus members of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowledges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual claim.  It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who would not bring individual suits for the relatively small sums involved will choose to join a class action.  That has no bearing, however, on Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s or the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 legal rights.  The likelihood that some (even many) plaintiffs will be induced to sue by the availability of a class action is just the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cincidental effec[t]\xe2\x80\x9d we have long held does not violate \xc2\xa72072(b), <em>Mississippi Publishing</em>, <em>supra</em>,\nat 445.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allstate argues that Rule 23 violates \xc2\xa72072(b) because the state law it displaces, \xc2\xa7901(b), creates a right that\nthe Federal Rule abridges\xe2\x80\x94namely, a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0not to be subjected to aggregated class-action liability\xe2\x80\x9d in a single suit.  Brief for Respondent 31.  To begin with, we doubt that that is so.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa7901(b) (which is to be found in New York\xe2\x80\x99s procedural code) confines it to claims under New York law; and of course New York has no power to alter substantive rights and duties created by other sovereigns.  As we have said, the <em>consequence</em> of excluding certain class actions may be to cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit, but the law itself alters only procedure.  In that respect, \xc2\xa7901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple joinder.  As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even if \xc2\xa7901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted \xe2\x80\x9cfor <em>substantive</em> <em>reasons</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 24 (emphasis added).  Its end was not to improve \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct of the litigation process itself\xe2\x80\x9d but to alter \xe2\x80\x9cthe outcome of that process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is that the substantive nature of New York\xe2\x80\x99s law, or its substantive purpose, <em>makes no difference.</em>  A Federal Rule of Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid in others\xe2\x80\x94or valid in some cases and invalid in others\xe2\x80\x94depending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state substantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for substantive purposes).  That could not be clearer in\n<em>Sibbach:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe petitioner says the phrase [\xe2\x80\x98substantive rights\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use Congress intended that in regulating procedure this Court should not deal with important and substantial rights theretofore recognized.  Recognized where and by whom?  The state courts are divided as to the power in the absence of statute to order a physical examination.  In a number such an order is authorized by statute or rule. \xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe asserted right, moreover, is no more important than many others enjoyed by litigants in District Courts sitting in the several states before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure altered and abolished old rights or privileges and created new ones in connection with the conduct of litigation. \xe2\x80\xa6 If we were to adopt the suggested criterion of the importance of the alleged right we should invite endless litigation and confusion worse confounded.  The test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure . \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d  312 U.

See <em>Sibbach</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 14; <em>Hanna</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 464; <em>Burlington</em>, 480 U. S., at 8.

We understand it to accept the framework we apply\xe2\x80\x94which requires first, determining whether the federal and state rules can be reconciled (because they answer different questions), and second, if they cannot, determining whether the Federal Rule runs afoul of \xc2\xa72072(b).  <em>Post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23 and \xc2\xa7901(b) conflict, <em>post</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316,<em> </em>and departs from us only with respect to the second part of the test, <em>i.e.</em>, whether application of the Federal Rule violates \xc2\xa72072(b), <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9313.<em> </em>Like us, it answers no, but for a reason different from ours.  <em>Post, </em>at 17\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not that Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it displaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not \xe2\x80\x9cfunction as a part of the State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of substantive rights and remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 1.  A state procedural rule is not preempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is \xe2\x80\x9cso bound up with,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently intertwined with,\xe2\x80\x9d a substantive state-law right or remedy \xe2\x80\x9cthat it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4, 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This analysis squarely conflicts with <em>Sibbach</em>, which established the rule we apply.  The concurrence contends that <em>Sibbach</em> did not rule out its approach, but that is not so.  Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on the idiosyncrasies of state law, <em>Sibbach</em> adopted and applied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal Rule \xe2\x80\x9creally regulates procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 U. S., at 14.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  That the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s approach would have yielded the same result in <em>Sibbach </em>proves nothing; what matters is the rule we <em>did</em> apply, and that rule leaves no room for special exemptions based on the function or purpose of a particular state rule.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We have rejected an attempt to read into <em>Sibbach </em>an exception with no basis in the opinion, see <em>Schlagenhauf</em>, 379 U. S., at 113\xe2\x80\x93114, and we see no reason to find such an implied limitation today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply <em>Sibbach</em>, but to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it).  Its approach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the statutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from \xe2\x80\x9cabridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b).  See <em>post, </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  There is something to that.  It is possible to understand how it can be determined whether a Federal Rule \xe2\x80\x9cenlarges\xe2\x80\x9d substantive rights without consulting State law: If the Rule creates a substantive right, even one that duplicates some state-created rights, it establishes a new <em>federal</em> right.  But it is hard to understand how it can be determined whether a Federal Rule \xe2\x80\x9cabridges\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmodifies\xe2\x80\x9d substantive rights without knowing what state-created rights would obtain if the Federal Rule did not exist.  <em>Sibbach</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on the challenged Federal Rule\xe2\x80\x94driven by the very real concern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State would be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314\xe2\x80\x94is hard to square with \xc2\xa72072(b)\xe2\x80\x99s terms.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sibbach</em> has been settled law, however, for nearly seven decades.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Setting aside any precedent requires a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial justification\xe2\x80\x9d beyond a bare belief that it was wrong.  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U.

And a party seeking to overturn a <em>statutory</em> precedent bears an even greater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us, <em>ibid.</em>, and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Finley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html">490 U.

In all events, Allstate has not even asked us to overrule <em>Sibbach</em>, let alone carried its burden of persuading us to do so.  Cf. <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 32 (2005).  Why we should cast aside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since (as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the result.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence also contends that applying<em> Sibbach</em> and assessing whether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure is not always easy.  See <em>post</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa010.  Undoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have managed to muddle through well enough in the 69 years since <em>Sibbach</em> was decided).  But as the concurrence acknowledges, <em>post</em>, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable: The statute itself refers to \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b), so there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinction.  What is more, the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s approach does nothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it many times over.  Instead of a single hard question of whether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure, that approach will present hundreds of hard questions, forcing federal courts to assess the substantive or procedural character of countless state rules that may conflict with a single Federal Rule.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  And it still does not sidestep the problem it seeks to avoid.  At the end of the day, one must come face to face with the decision whether or not the state policy (with which a putatively procedural state rule may be \xe2\x80\x9cbound up\xe2\x80\x9d) pertains to a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right or remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether it is substance or procedure.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The more one explores the alternatives to <em>Sibbach</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule, the more its wisdom becomes apparent.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must acknowledge the reality that keeping the federal-court door open to class actions that cannot proceed in state court will produce forum shopping.  That is unacceptable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules created to fill supposed \xe2\x80\x9cgaps\xe2\x80\x9d in positive federal law.  See<em> Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471\xe2\x80\x93472.  For where neither the Constitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of decision or authorizes a federal court to supply one, \xe2\x80\x9cstate law must govern because there can be no other law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see Clark, <em>Erie\xe2\x80\x99s </em>Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1289, 1302, 1311 (2007).  But divergence from state law, with the attendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable (indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform system of federal procedure.  Congress itself has created the possibility that the same case may follow a different course if filed in federal instead of state court.  Cf. <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 472\xe2\x80\x93473.  The short of the matter is that a Federal Rule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters the outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shopping.  To hold otherwise would be to \xe2\x80\x9cdisembowel either the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s grant of power over federal procedure\xe2\x80\x9d or Congress\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 473\xe2\x80\x93474.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0Y.

If one concludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal Rule itself is invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s concern would make more sense if many Federal Rules that effectively alter state-law rights \xe2\x80\x9cbound up with procedures\xe2\x80\x9d would survive under <em>Sibbach</em>.  But as the concurrence concedes, <em>post</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa010, very few would do so.  The possible existence of a few outlier instances does not prove <em>Sibbach</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is absurd.

Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \xc2\xa7901(b) (West 2006), is a procedural rule that is not part of New York\xe2\x80\x99s substantive law.  Accordingly, I agree with Justice Scalia that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 must apply in this case and join Parts I and II\xe2\x80\x93A of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  But I also agree with Justice Ginsburg that there are some state procedural rules that federal courts must apply in diversity cases because they function as a part of the State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of substantive rights and remedies.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is a long-recognized principle that federal courts sitting in diversity \xe2\x80\x9capply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanna</em> v. <em>Plumer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/460/index.html"></a><a href="/us/380/460/index.html">380 U. S. 460</a>, 465 (1965).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This principle is governed by a statutory framework, and the way that it is administered varies depending upon whether there is a federal rule addressed to the matter.  See <em>id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93472.  If no federal rule applies, a federal court must follow the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71652, and make the \xe2\x80\x9crelatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471, to determine whether the state law is the \xe2\x80\x9crule of decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  But when a situation is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act inquiry by its own terms does not apply.  See \xc2\xa71652; <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471.  Instead, the Rules Enabling Act (Enabling Act) controls.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That does not mean, however, that the federal rule always governs.  Congress has provided for a system of uniform federal rules, see <em>ibid.</em>, under which federal courts sitting in diversity operate as \xe2\x80\x9can independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Byrd</em> v. <em>Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/525/index.html">356 U. S. 525</a>, 537 (1958), and not as state-court clones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are managed by Article III judges.  See <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 473\xe2\x80\x93474.  But while Congress may have the constitutional power to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with state substantive law in any number of respects, that is not what Congress has done.  Instead, it has provided in the Enabling Act that although \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(a), those rules \xe2\x80\x9cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b).  Therefore, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, \xe2\x80\xa6 the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule\xe2\x80\x9d unless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.  <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Enabling Act and the Rules of Decision Act \xe2\x80\x9csay, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state \xe2\x80\x98substantive\xe2\x80\x99 law and federal \xe2\x80\x98procedural\xe2\x80\x99 law,\xe2\x80\x9d the inquiries are not the same.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.  The Enabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in the \xe2\x80\x9crelatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 471, but instead instructs only that federal rules cannot \xe2\x80\x9cabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b).  The Enabling Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitation does not mean that federal rules cannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that federal rules cannot displace a State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of its own rights or remedies.  See <em>Sibbach</em> v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/312/1/index.html">312 U.

To the contrary, federal rules must be interpreted with some degree of \xe2\x80\x9csensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gasperini</em> v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/415/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/415/index.html">518 U.

This can be a tricky balance to implement.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to observe that the balance Congress has struck turns, in part, on the nature of the state law that is being displaced by a federal rule.  And in my view, the application of that balance does not necessarily turn on whether the state law at issue takes the <em>form</em> of what is traditionally described as substantive or procedural.  Rather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part of a State\xe2\x80\x99s framework of substantive rights or remedies.  See \xc2\xa72072(b); cf. <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.

Co.</em> v. <em>Tompkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html">304 U.

A \xe2\x80\x9cstate procedural rule, though undeniably \xe2\x80\x98procedural\xe2\x80\x99 in the ordinary sense of the term,\xe2\x80\x9d may exist \xe2\x80\x9cto influence substantive outcomes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>S. A. Healy Co.</em> v. <em>Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Dist.,</em> 60 F. 3d 305, 310 (CA7 1995) (Posner, J.), and may in some instances become so bound up with the state-created right or remedy that it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy.  Such laws, for example, may be seemingly procedural rules that make it significantly more difficult to bring or to prove a claim, thus serving to limit the scope of that claim.  See, <em>e.g, Cohen</em>, 337 U. S., at 555 (state \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure\xe2\x80\x9d that required plaintiffs to post bond before suing); <em>Guaranty Trust Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/99/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/99/index.html">326 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U.

And were federal courts to ignore those portions of substantive state law that operate as procedural devices, it could in many instances limit the ways that sovereign States may define their rights and remedies.  When a State chooses to use a traditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the scope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts must recognize and respect that choice.  Cf. <em>Ragan</em> v. <em>Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/530/index.html">337 U.

That Act requires, <em>inter alia</em>, that federal rules \xe2\x80\x9cnot abridge, enlarge or modify <em>any</em> substantive right.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072(b) (emphasis added).  Unlike Justice Scalia, I believe that an application of a federal rule that effectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created right or remedy violates this command.  Congress may have the constitutional power \xe2\x80\x9cto supplant state law\xe2\x80\x9d with rules that are \xe2\x80\x9crationally capable of classification as procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted), but we should generally presume that it has not done so.  Cf. <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (observing that \xe2\x80\x9cwe start with the assumption\xe2\x80\x9d that a federal statute does not displace a State\xe2\x80\x99s law \xe2\x80\x9cunless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, the mandate that federal rules \xe2\x80\x9cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right\xe2\x80\x9d evinces the opposite intent, as does Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to delegate the creation of rules to this Court rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74509, p.\xc2\xa0265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back into the first.  When a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Semtek Int\xe2\x80\x99l Inc.</em> v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/497/index.html">531 U.

A federal rule, therefore, cannot govern a particular case in which the rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right.  And absent a governing federal rule, a federal court must engage in the traditional Rules of Decision Act inquiry, under the <em>Erie </em>line of cases.  This application of the Enabling Act shows \xe2\x80\x9csensitivity to important state interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 7, and \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory policies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2, but it does so as Congress authorized, by ensuring that federal rules that ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(a), do \xe2\x80\x9cnot abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia believes that the sole Enabling Act question is whether the federal rule \xe2\x80\x9creally regulates procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12, 16, 17, 20, n.\xc2\xa013 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), which means, apparently, whether it<em> </em>regulates \xe2\x80\x9cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 rights are enforced,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I respectfully disagree.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This interpretation of the Enabling Act is consonant with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s first limitation to \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rules of practice and procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(a).  But it ignores the second limitation that such rules also \xe2\x80\x9cnot abridge, enlarge or modify <em>any</em> substantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72072(b) (emphasis added),[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and in so doing ignores the balance that Congress struck between uniform rules of federal procedure and respect for a State\xe2\x80\x99s construction of its own rights and remedies.  It also ignores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright \xc2\xa74509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially created rules displacing state substantive law.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the plurality appears to agree with much of my interpretation of \xc2\xa72072, see <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, it nonetheless rejects that approach for two reasons, both of which are mistaken.  First, Justice Scalia worries that if federal courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state law, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determinations about whether application of a given rule would displace a state determination about substantive rights.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15, 21\xe2\x80\x9322, and nn.\xc2\xa014, 15.  I do not see why an Enabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is more taxing than Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  But in any event, that inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it may not be easy to decide what is actually a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe designations substantive and procedural become important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ely 723; see also Wright \xc2\xa74509, at 266.  The question, therefore, is not what rule <em>we </em>think would be easiest on federal courts.  The question is what rule Congress established.  Although, Justice Scalia may generally prefer easily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does not give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of the Rules Enabling Act.  Courts cannot ignore text and context in the service of simplicity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the plurality argues that its interpretation of the Enabling Act is dictated by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Sibbach</em>, which applied a Federal Rule about when parties must submit to medical examinations.  But the plurality misreads that opinion.  As Justice Harlan observed in <em>Hanna</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cshorthand formulations which have appeared in earlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that frequently arise from oversimplification.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 475 (concurring opinion).  To understand <em>Sibbach</em>, it is first necessary to understand the issue that was before the Court.  The petitioner raised only the facial question whether \xe2\x80\x9cRules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] are \xe2\x80\xa6 within the mandate of Congress to this court\xe2\x80\x9d and not the specific question of \xe2\x80\x9cthe obligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  312 U. S., at 9.  The Court, therefore, had no occasion to consider whether the particular application of the Federal Rules in question would offend the Enabling Act.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor, in <em>Sibbach</em>, was any further analysis necessary to the resolution of the case because the matter at issue, requiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rights\xe2\x80\x9d under the Enabling Act.  Although most state rules bearing on the litigation process are adopted for some policy reason, few seemingly \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d rules define the scope of a substantive right or remedy.  The matter at issue in <em>Sibbach</em> reflected competing federal and state judgments about privacy interests.  Those privacy concerns may have been weighty and in some sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the scope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litigation.  Thus, in response to the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument in <em>Sibbach </em>that \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rights\xe2\x80\x9d include not only \xe2\x80\x9crights sought to be adjudicated by the litigants\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral principle[s]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[s] of public policy that the legislature is able to pass upon,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98substantive rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d embraces only state rights, such as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be enforced in the judicial proceedings.  <em>Id.</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  If the Federal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then perhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been different.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg views the basic issue in this case as whether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to join plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that \xe2\x80\x9cdefines the dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d of a state-created claim dictates the opposite answer.  <em>Post, </em>at 12.  As explained above, I readily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state rule that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98procedural\xe2\x80\x99 in the ordinary sense of the term,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>S. A. Healy Co.</em>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 310, but sufficiently interwoven with the scope of a substantive right or remedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the federal rule would have to give way.  In my view, however, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Rule 23 Controls Class Certification</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the District Court in the case before us was asked to certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 squarely governed the determination whether the court should do so.  That is the explicit function of Rule 23.  Rule 23, therefore, must apply unless its application would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I understand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does <em>not </em>govern the question of class certification in this matter because New York has made a substantive judgment that such a class should not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.  Although, as discussed <em>infra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9320, I do not accept the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view of \xc2\xa7901(b), I also do not see how the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  I agree with Justice Ginsburg that courts should \xe2\x80\x9cavoi[d] immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on state prerogatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, and should in some instances \xe2\x80\x9cinterpre[t] the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that is not what the dissent has done.  Simply because a rule should<em> </em>be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not follow that courts may rewrite the rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At bottom, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Rule 23 seems to be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its application would create no <em>Erie</em> problem.  The dissent would apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under <em>Erie </em>even to cases in which there is a governing federal rule, and thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471.  The question is only whether the Enabling Act is satisfied.  Although it reflects a laudable concern to protect \xe2\x80\x9cstate regulatory policies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted), Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s approach would, in my view, work an end run around Congress\xe2\x80\x99 system of uniform federal rules, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072, and our decision in <em>Hanna</em>.  Federal courts can and should interpret federal rules with sensitivity to \xe2\x80\x9cstate prerogatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4; but even when \xe2\x80\x9cstate interests \xe2\x80\xa6 warrant our respectful consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 8, federal courts cannot rewrite the rules.  If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly that \xc2\xa7901(b) is substantive and that class certification should be denied, then they should argue within the Enabling Act\xe2\x80\x99s framework.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 427, n.\xc2\xa07; accord, <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Applying</em> <em>Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a class action such as this one, a federal court must inquire whether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York\xe2\x80\x99s rights or remedies, and thereby violate the Enabling Act.  This inquiry is not always a simple one because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that cannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,\xe2\x80\x9d Wright \xc2\xa74508, at 232\xe2\x80\x93233, and almost \xe2\x80\x9cany rule can be said to have \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98substantive effects,\xe2\x80\x99 affecting society\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of risks and rewards,\xe2\x80\x9d Ely 724, n. 170.  Faced with a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question and that displaces a state rule, one can often argue that the state rule was <em>really </em>some part of the State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of its rights or remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling Act problem is a high one.  The mere fact that a state law is designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a judgment about how state courts ought to operate and not a judgment about the scope of state-created rights and remedies.  And for the purposes of operating a federal court system, there are costs involved in attempting to discover the true nature of a state procedural rule and allowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule that appears to govern the same question.  The mere possibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created right is not sufficient.  There must be little doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of CPLR \xc2\xa7901(b) expressly and unambiguously applies not only to claims based on New York law but also to claims based on federal law or the law of any other State.  And there is no interpretation from New York courts to the contrary.  It is therefore hard to see how \xc2\xa7901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though procedural in form, serves the function of defining New York\xe2\x80\x99s rights or remedies.  This is all the more apparent because lawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal class actions well before New York passed \xc2\xa7901(b) in 1975, and New York had done nothing to prevent that.  It is true, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited amount of legislative history that can be read to suggest that the New York officials who supported \xc2\xa7901(b) wished to create a \xe2\x80\x9climitation\xe2\x80\x9d on New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 8.  But, as Justice Scalia notes, that is not the law that New York adopted.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly describe a judgment that \xc2\xa7901(b) would operate as a limitation on New York\xe2\x80\x99s statutory damages.  In evaluating that legislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between procedural rules adopted for <em>some</em> policy reason and seemingly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a substantive right or remedy.  Although almost every rule is adopted for some<em> </em>reason and has some<em> </em>effect on the outcome of litigation, not every state rule \xe2\x80\x9cdefines the dimensions of [a] claim itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 12.  New York clearly crafted \xc2\xa7901(b) with the intent that only certain lawsuits\xe2\x80\x94those for which there were not statutory penalties\xe2\x80\x94could be joined in class actions in New York courts.  That decision reflects a policy judgment about which lawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class form and which should not.  As Justice Ginsburg carefully outlines, see <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, \xc2\xa7901(b) was \xe2\x80\x9capparently\xe2\x80\x9d adopted in response to fears that the class-action procedure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0annihilating punishment of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\xe2\x80\x99s Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp.</em>, 8 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007).  But statements such as these are not particularly strong evidence that \xc2\xa7901(b) serves to define who can obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a class would enlarge New York\xe2\x80\x99s remedy.  Any device that makes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to recover damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some opponents of a broad class-action device \xe2\x80\x9cargued that there was no <em>need</em> to permit class actions in order to encourage litigation \xe2\x80\xa6 when statutory penalties \xe2\x80\xa6 provided an aggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to pursue a claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 211, 863 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 1015 (emphasis added).  But those opponents may have felt merely that, for any number of reasons, New York courts should not conduct trials in the class format when that format is unnecessary to motivate litigation.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Justice Ginsburg asserts that this could not be true because \xe2\x80\x9csuits seeking statutory damages are arguably <em>best</em> suited to the class device because individual proof of actual damages is unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But some people believe that class actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as they join together slightly disparate claims or force courts to adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits.  It is not for us to dismiss the possibility that New York legislators shared in those beliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when it appeared to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative history of \xc2\xa7901 thus reveals a classically procedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims in New York courts (under any source of law) only when it is necessary to do so, and not making it <em>too </em>easy when the class tool is not required.  This is the same sort of calculation that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for briefs.  There is of course a difference of degree between those examples and class certification, but not a difference of kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical effect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but that does not transform it into a damages \xe2\x80\x9cproscription,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06, 21, or \xe2\x80\x9climitation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa02, 8, 9, 12, 25.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difference of degree is relevant to the forum shopping considerations that are part of the Rules of Decision Act or <em>Erie </em>inquiry.  If the applicable federal rule did not govern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly read not to do so), then those considerations would matter, for precisely the reasons given by the dissent.  See <em>post</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9324.  But that is not <em>this</em> case.  As the Court explained in <em>Hanna</em>, it is an \xe2\x80\x9cincorrect assumption that the rule of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Thompkins </em>constitutes the appropriate test of \xe2\x80\xa6 the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that both the Enabling Act and the <em>Erie </em>rule say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state \xe2\x80\x98substantive\xe2\x80\x99 law and federal \xe2\x80\x98procedural\xe2\x80\x99 law,\xe2\x80\x9d but the tests are different and reflect the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthey were designed to control very different sorts of decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 471.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only decision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case would \xe2\x80\x9cabridge, enlarge or modify\xe2\x80\x9d New York\xe2\x80\x99s substantive rights or remedies.   \xc2\xa72072(b).  Although one can argue that class certification would enlarge New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d damages remedy, see <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa02, 8, 9, 12, 25, such arguments rest on extensive speculation about what the New York Legislature had in mind when it created \xc2\xa7901(b).  But given that there are two plausible competing narratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect the plain textual reading of \xc2\xa7901(b), a rule in New York\xe2\x80\x99s procedural code about when to certify class actions brought under any source of law, and respect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal courts.  In order to displace a federal rule, there must be more than just a possibility that the state rule is different than it appears.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I concur in part and concur in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0See also <em>Gasperini</em> v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/415/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/415/index.html">518 U.

This is not an objection to my interpretation of the Enabling Act\xe2\x80\x94that courts must look to whether a federal rule alters substantive rights in a given case\xe2\x80\x94but simply to the way I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that regulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might actually define a substantive right.  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s objection, moreover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears procedural really is not.  A rule about how damages are reviewed on appeal may really be a damages cap.  See <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 427.  A rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really be a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress.  A rule that a claim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a definition of the scope of the claim.  These are the sorts of rules that one might describe as \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural,\xe2\x80\x9d but they nonetheless define substantive rights.  Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the federal rule would have altered the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rights.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean that no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State\xe2\x80\x99s own rights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 rights are enforced,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern.  \xc2\xa0There are many ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of its substantive law.  For example, statutes of limitations, although in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a temporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to promulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in some instances, be required to apply state limitations periods.  Similarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could eviscerate a critical aspect\xe2\x80\x94albeit one that deals with <em>how </em>a right is enforced\xe2\x80\x94of a State\xe2\x80\x99s framework of rights and remedies.  Or if a federal rule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages are reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state damages cap.  Cf. <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 427.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia responds that some of these federal rules might be invalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not \xe2\x80\x9creally regulat[e] procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa013 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s test really is.  See n.\xc2\xa010, <em>infra</em>.  The response is also limited to those rules that can be described as \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d substance, <em>ante</em>, at 13; it does not address those federal rules that alter the right at issue in the litigation, see<em> Sibbach </em>v.<em> Wilson &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/312/1/index.html">312 U. S. 1</a>, 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (1941), only when they displace particular state laws.  Justice Scalia speculates that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may well have accepted\xe2\x80\x9d the occasional alteration of substantive rights \xe2\x80\x9cas the price of a uniform system of federal procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, n.\xc2\xa013.  Were we forced to speculate about the balance that Congress struck, I might very well agree.  But no speculation is necessary because Congress explicitly told us that federal rules \xe2\x80\x9cshall not\xe2\x80\x9d alter \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d substantive right.  \xc2\xa72072(b).</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072 will displace a State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of its own substantive rights.  See Wright \xc2\xa74509, at 272 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9cunusual cases occasionally might arise in which \xe2\x80\xa6 because of an unorthodox state rule of law, application of a Civil Rule \xe2\x80\xa6 would intrude upon state substantive rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, moreover, is not much more determinative than mine.  Although it avoids courts\xe2\x80\x99 having to evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal rule is really \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is hard to know the answer to that question and especially hard to resolve it without considering the nature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98test\xe2\x80\x99 is no test at all\xe2\x80\x94in a sense, it is little more than the statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is procedural.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa74509, at 264.  </p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The petitioner in <em>Sibbach </em>argued only that federal rules could not validly address subjects involving \xe2\x80\x9cimportant questions of policy,\xe2\x80\x9d Supp. Brief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of Respondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner argued only that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical examination\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98substantive\xe2\x80\x99 right forbidden by Congress\xe2\x80\x9d to be addressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though in theory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own words, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his contention\xe2\x80\xa6 [did] not in itself involve the [applicable] law of Illinois,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and the petitioner in her briefing referenced the otherwise applicable state law only \xe2\x80\x9cto show that [she] was in a position to make the contention,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., that is, to show that the federal court was applying a federal rule and not, under the Rules of Decision Act, applying state law, see <em>id.</em>, at 3.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The plurality defends its view by including a long quote from two paragraphs of <em>Sibbach</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But the quoted passage of <em>Sibbach</em> describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with\xe2\x80\x9d particular subject matter.  312 U. S., at 13.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s block quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in which the Court explained that the term \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive rights\xe2\x80\x9d in the Enabling Act \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly embraces such rights\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9crights conferred by law to be protected and enforced,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe right not to be injured in one\xe2\x80\x99s person by another\xe2\x80\x99s negligence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto redress [such] infraction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right \xe2\x80\x9cto redress [an] infraction,\xe2\x80\x9d will depend on the state law that it displaces.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases \xe2\x80\x9creally regulates procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sibbach</em>, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not \xe2\x80\x9creally regulat[e] procedure\xe2\x80\x9d when it displaces those rare state rules that, although \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the rights and remedies available in a case.  This is so because what is procedural in one context may be substantive in another.  See <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471; <em>Guaranty Trust Co.</em> v. <em>York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/99/index.html"></a><a href="/us/326/99/index.html">326 U.

Indeed, in <em>Hanna</em> we cited <em>Sibbach</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the Enabling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated by the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9ca court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act \xe2\x80\xa6 need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts,\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U. S., at 473.  And most of our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the framework for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned <em>Sibbach </em>at all but cited only <em>Hanna.</em>  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Burlington Northern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Woods</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/1/index.html">480 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia notes that in <em>Mississippi Publishing Corp.</em> v. <em>Murphree</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/438/index.html">326 U. S. 438</a> (1946), we used language that supported his view.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  But in that case, we contemplated only that the Federal Rule in question might have \xe2\x80\x9cincidental effects \xe2\x80\xa6 upon the rights of litigants,\xe2\x80\x9d explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that the application of Rule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rights to adjudication by the district court for northern Mississippi\xe2\x80\x9d rather than southern Mississippi \xe2\x80\x9cwill undoubtedly affect those rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U. S., at 445\xe2\x80\x93446.  There was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the rights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or modify the rights themselves.</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s premises that a class cannot be certified.  The dissent contends that \xc2\xa7901(b) is a damages \xe2\x80\x9climitation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa02, 8, 9, 12, 25, or \xe2\x80\x9cproscription,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06, 21, whereas Rule 23 \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not command that a particular remedy be available when a party sues in a representative capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11, and that consequently both provisions can apply.  Yet even if the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question whether petitioner may certify a class, and \xc2\xa7901(b) would be relevant only to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action lawsuit, may collect statutory damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may be that if the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7901(b) were correct, this class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the federal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d)(6).  But that issue was not raised in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss (from which the case comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the Court.  In any event, although the lead plaintiff has \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledged that its individual claim\xe2\x80\x9d is for less than the required amount in controversy, see 549 F.\xc2\xa03d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what actual damages the entire class can allege.  Thus, even if the Court were to adopt all of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s premises, I believe the correct disposition would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of whether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.</p>\n<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In its <em>Erie </em>analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns create laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws will apply only within their territory.  See <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  That is a true fact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position.  For one thing, as the dissent observes, this <em>Erie </em>analysis is relevant only if there is no conflict between Rule 23 and \xc2\xa7901(b), and the court can thus apply both.  <em>Post</em>, at 17.  But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the only question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act.  See <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 471.   And that inquiry is different from the Rules of Decision Act, or <em>Erie</em>, inquiry.  See <em>id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93471.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe dissent\xe2\x80\x99s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when interpreting statutes, context matters.  Thus, we sometimes presume that laws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending upon, <em>inter alia</em>, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume that \xe2\x80\x9cthe character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>American Banana Co.</em> v. <em>United Fruit Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/213/347/index.html">213 U. S. 347</a>, 356 (1909).  But in the context of \xc2\xa7901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes little sense.  That presumption applies almost only to laws governing what people can or cannot do.  Section 901(b), however, is not directed to the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.  Thus, \xc2\xa7901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it states that it governs <em>New York</em> courts.  It is possible that the New York Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear claims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims under New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had written a limit on New York remedies.  But because New York set up \xc2\xa7901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong presumption is to the contrary.</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature would create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply only when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a lawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action.  But it is hard to see how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York\xe2\x80\x99s penalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or individual, and that \xc2\xa7901(b) addresses penalties that are created under any source of state or federal law.</p>\n<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg asserts that class certification in this matter would \xe2\x80\x9ctransform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  But in fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one $5,000,000 case.  It may be that without class certification, not all of the potential plaintiffs would bring their cases.  But that is true of any procedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located courthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other features of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963090">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nGINSBURG, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state court, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York Ins. Law Ann. \xc2\xa75106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for overdue benefits would, by Shady Grove\xe2\x80\x99s own measure, amount to no more than $500.  By instead filing in federal court based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 diverse citizenship and requesting class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for the class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.  The New York Legislature has barred this remedy, instructing that, unless specifically permitted, \xe2\x80\x9can action to recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \xc2\xa7901(b) (West 2006).  The Court nevertheless holds that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures for the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts the application of \xc2\xa7901(b) in diversity suits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New York\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.  Our decisions, however, caution us to ask, before undermining state legislation: Is this conflict really necessary?  Cf. Traynor, Is This Conflict Really Necessary? 37 Tex. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 657 (1959).  Had the Court engaged in that inquiry, it would not have read Rule 23 to collide with New York\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in keeping certain monetary awards reasonably bounded.  I would continue to interpret Federal Rules with awareness of, and sensitivity to, important state regulatory policies.  Because today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment radically departs from that course, I dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the <em>Erie </em>doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d it is long settled, \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gasperini</em> v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/415/index.html">518 U.

See <em>Erie</em>, 304 U. S., at 78.  Originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a policy of prime importance to our federal system.  We have therefore applied the Act \xe2\x80\x9cwith an eye alert to \xe2\x80\xa6 avoiding disregard of State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Guaranty Trust Co.</em> v. <em>York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/99/index.html">326 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072.  Pursuant to this statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In interpreting the scope of the Rules, including, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the limits on our authority.

See <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93474.  If, however, no Federal Rule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted in <em>Erie</em>, controls.  That Act directs federal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when failure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield markedly disparate litigation outcomes.  See <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 428; <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 468.

Although Federal Rule 3 specified that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that the Rule did not displace a state law that tied an action\xe2\x80\x99s commencement to service of the summons.  <em>Id.</em>, at 531\xe2\x80\x93533.

S. 541</a> (1949), the Court held applicable in a diversity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prerequisite to pursuit of a stockholder\xe2\x80\x99s derivative action, to post a bond as security for costs.  At the time of the litigation, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s institution of a derivative action in federal court.  Although the Federal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no conflict between the Rule and the state statute in question; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court observed.  See <em>id.</em>, at 556.  Burdensome as the security-for-costs requirement may be, <em>Cohen</em> made plain, suitors could not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all of these cases, the Court stated in <em>Hanna</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which covered the point in dispute, <em>Erie</em> commanded the enforcement of state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  380 U.

In <em>Hanna</em> itself, the Court found the clash \xe2\x80\x9cunavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>; the petitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by Federal Rule 4(d)(1), but that \xe2\x80\x9chow-to\xe2\x80\x9d method did not satisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service on an executor or administrator.  Even as it rejected the Massachusetts prescription in favor of the federal procedure, however, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he majority in Hanna recognized \xe2\x80\xa6 that federal rules \xe2\x80\xa6 must be interpreted by the courts applying them, and that the process of interpretation can and should reflect an awareness of legitimate state interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  R.

In <em>Walker</em>, the Court took up the question whether <em>Ragan </em>should be overruled; we held, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly conflict with state rules governing the time when an action commences for purposes of tolling a limitations period.  446 U. S., at 749\xe2\x80\x93752.  Rule 3, we said, addresses only \xe2\x80\x9cthe date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 751, and does not \xe2\x80\x9cpurpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 750\xe2\x80\x93751.  Significant state policy interests would be frustrated, we observed, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state rule, which required actual service on the defendant to stop the clock on the statute of limitations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 750\xe2\x80\x93752.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We were similarly attentive to a State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory policy in <em>Gasperini</em>.  That diversity case concerned the standard for determining when the large size of a jury verdict warrants a new trial.  Federal and state courts alike had generally employed a \xe2\x80\x9cshock the conscience\xe2\x80\x9d test in reviewing jury awards for excessiveness.  See 518 U. S., at 422.  Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule 59(a) which, as worded at the time of <em>Gasperini</em>, instructed that a trial court could grant a new trial \xe2\x80\x9cfor any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995).  In an effort to provide greater control, New York prescribed procedures under which jury verdicts would be examined to determine whether they \xe2\x80\x9cdeviate[d] materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 423\xe2\x80\x93425 (quoting CPLR \xc2\xa75501(c)).  This Court held that Rule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of New York\xe2\x80\x99s invigorated test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most recently, in <em>Semtek</em>, we addressed the claim-preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a diversity action on the basis of a California statute of limitations.  The case came to us after the same plaintiff renewed the same fray against the same defendant in a Maryland state court.  (Plaintiff chose Maryland because that State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period had not yet run.)  We held that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involuntary dismissal \xe2\x80\x9coperate[d] as an adjudication on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in Maryland.  To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Maryland courts from entertaining the case, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act,\xe2\x80\x9d 531 U. S., at 503, and \xe2\x80\x9cwould in many cases violate [<em>Erie</em>\xe2\x80\x99s] federalism principle,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 504.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, both before and after <em>Hanna</em>, the above-described decisions show, federal courts have been cautioned by this Court to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpre[t] the Federal Rules \xe2\x80\xa6 with sensitivity to important state interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U.

Yet today, the Court gives no quarter to New York\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on statutory damages and requires the lower courts to thwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive damages, New York\xe2\x80\x99s law controls the penalty to which a defendant may be exposed in a single suit.  The story behind \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment deserves telling.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New York proposed a new class-action statute designed \xe2\x80\x9cto set up a flexible, functional scheme\xe2\x80\x9d that would provide \xe2\x80\x9can effective, but controlled group remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial Conference Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Laws pp.\xc2\xa01477, 1493 (McKinney).  As originally drafted, the legislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class actions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for certification, eventually codified at \xc2\xa7901(a), that closely tracked those listed in Rule 23.  See CPLR \xc2\xa7901(a) (requiring, for class certification, numerosity, predominance, typicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New York Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s hopper, \xe2\x80\x9cvarious groups advocated for the addition of a provision that would prohibit class action plaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty \xe2\x80\xa6 except when expressly authorized in the pertinent statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp.</em>, 8 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1012, 1015 (2007).

Section 901(a) allows courts leeway in deciding whether to certify a class, but \xc2\xa7901(b) rejects the use of the class mechanism to pursue the particular remedy of statutory damages.  The limitation was not designed with the fair conduct<em> </em>or efficiency of litigation in mind.  Indeed, suits seeking statutory damages are arguably <em>best</em> suited to the class device because individual proof of actual damages is unnecessary.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s decision instead to block class-action proceedings for statutory damages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means to a manifestly substantive end: Limiting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbitant inflation of penalties\xe2\x80\x94remedies the New York Legislature created with individual suits in mind.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shady Grove contends\xe2\x80\x94and the Court today agrees\xe2\x80\x94that Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions.  The Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes, states that Shady Grove\xe2\x80\x99s suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay be\xe2\x80\x9d maintained as a class action, which conflicts with \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that it \xe2\x80\x9cmay not\xe2\x80\x9d so proceed.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted).  Accordingly, the Court insists, \xc2\xa7901(b) \xe2\x80\x9ccannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Concluding that Rule 23 does not violate the Rules Enabling Act, the Court holds that the federal provision controls Shady Grove\xe2\x80\x99s ability to seek, on behalf of a class, a statutory penalty of over $5,000,000.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316 (plurality opinion); <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9322 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, I am convinced, finds conflict where none is necessary.  Mindful of the history behind \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the thrust of our precedent, and the substantive-rights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act, I conclude, as did the Second Circuit and every District Court to have considered the question in any detail,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] that Rule 23 does not collide with \xc2\xa7901(b).  As the Second Circuit well understood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to class certification and postcertification proceedings\xe2\x80\x94but it does not command that a particular remedy be available when a party sues in a representative capacity.  See 549 F.\xc2\xa03d 137, 143 (2008).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Section 901(b), in contrast, trains on that latter issue.  Sensibly read, Rule 23 governs procedural aspects of class litigation, but allows state law to control the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may pursue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing a claim for relief, while \xc2\xa7901(b) defines the dimensions of the claim itself.  In this regard, it is immaterial that \xc2\xa7901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than retail, fashion.  The New York Legislature could have embedded the limitation in every provision creating a cause of action for which a penalty is authorized; \xc2\xa7901(b) operates as shorthand to the same effect.  It is as much a part of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be were it included claim by claim in the New York Code.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmay not\xe2\x80\x9d be maintained as a class action.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.  Putting the question that way, the Court does not home in on the reason <em>why</em>.  Rule 23 authorizes class treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites because the class mechanism generally affords a fair and efficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication.  Section 901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does not allow class members to recover statutory damages because the New York Legislature considered the result of adjudicating such claims en masse<em> </em>to be exorbitant.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The fair and efficient <em>conduct</em> of class litigation is the legitimate concern of Rule 23; the <em>remedy</em> for an infraction of state law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers.  Cf. Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of <em>Erie</em>, 87 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 693, 722 (1974) (It is relevant \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the state provision embodies a substantive policy or represents only a procedural disagreement with the federal rulemakers respecting the fairest and most efficient way of conducting litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Suppose, for example, that a State, wishing to cap damages in class actions at $1,000,000, enacted a statute providing that \xe2\x80\x9ca suit to recover more than $1,000,000 may not be maintained as a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning\xe2\x80\x94which attributes dispositive significance to the words \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be maintained\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Rule 23 would preempt this provision, nevermind that Congress, by authorizing the promulgation of rules of procedure for federal courts, surely did not intend to displace state-created ceilings on damages.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Court suggests that the analysis might differ if the statute \xe2\x80\x9climit[ed] the remedies available in an existing class action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, such that Rule 23 might not conflict with a state statute prescribing that \xe2\x80\x9cno more than $1,000,000 may be recovered in a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no real difference in the purpose and intended effect of these two hypothetical statutes.  The notion that one directly impinges on Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s domain, while the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the office of Rule 23.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23 and \xc2\xa7901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that a federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect to both state and federal prescriptions.  Plaintiffs seeking to vindicate claims for which the State has provided a statutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action if they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual damages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative class member who objects can opt out and pursue actual damages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an individual action.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mendez </em>v. <em>The Radec Corp.</em>, 260 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); <em>Brzychnalski</em> v. <em>Unesco, Inc.</em>, 35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  See also Alexander, Practice Commentaries, at<em> </em>105 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven if a statutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most courts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class recovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of CPLR 901(b).\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this manner, the Second Circuit explained, \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23\xe2\x80\x99s procedural requirements for class actions can be applied along with the substantive requirement of CPLR 901(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  549 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 144.  In sum, while phrased as responsive to the question whether certain class actions may begin, \xc2\xa7901(b) is unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions must end.  On that remedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves \xc2\xa7901(b) in control of the remedial issue at the core of this case should be dispelled by our <em>Erie </em>jurisprudence, including <em>Hanna</em>,<em> </em>which counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions against stretching a rule to cover every situation it could conceivably reach.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no reason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether claims made eligible for class treatment by some <em>other</em> law should be certified as class actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  To the contrary, <em>Palmer</em>, <em>Ragan</em>, <em>Cohen</em>, <em>Walker</em>, <em>Gasperini</em>, and <em>Semtek</em> provide good reason to look to the law that creates the right to recover.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937.  That is plainly so on a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there any reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief when the State that created the remedy disallows its pursuit on behalf of a class?  None at all is the answer our federal system should give.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain penalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class relief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for certain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum recovery.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 15  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(B) (Truth in Lending Act) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the case of a class action \xe2\x80\xa6 no minimum recovery shall be applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71693m(a)(2)(B) (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) (same); 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74010(a)(2)(B)(i) (Expedited Fund Availability Act) (same).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment denies to the States the full power Congress has to keep certain monetary awards within reasonable bounds.  Cf. <em>Beard</em> v. <em>Kindler</em>, 558 U.

S., at 428; <em>Hanna</em>, 380 U. S., at 468, n.\xc2\xa09; <em>York</em>, 326 U. S., at 109.  As this case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award statutory penalties in class actions while New York courts are bound by \xc2\xa7901(b)\xe2\x80\x99s proscription, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial variations between state and federal [money judgments] may be expected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U.

The \xe2\x80\x9cvariation\xe2\x80\x9d here is indeed \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shady Grove seeks class relief that is <em>ten thousand times</em> greater than the individual remedy available to it in state court.  As the plurality acknowledges, <em>ante</em>, at 22, forum shopping will undoubtedly result if a plaintiff need only file in federal instead of state court to seek a massive monetary award explicitly barred by state law.  See <em>Gasperini</em>, 518 U. S., at 431 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Erie</em> precludes a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that would have been tolerated in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The \xe2\x80\x9caccident of diversity of citizenship,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Klaxon Co.</em> v. <em>Stentor Elec.

See also <em>id.</em>, at 439\xe2\x80\x93440 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cA state-law ceiling on allowable damages \xe2\x80\xa6 is a substantive rule of decision that federal courts must apply in diversity cases governed by New York law.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 464 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cState substantive law controls what injuries are compensable and in what amount.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <em>Gasperini</em>, we determined that New York\xe2\x80\x99s standard for measuring the alleged excessiveness of a jury verdict was designed to provide a control analogous to a damages cap.  <em>Id.</em>, at 429.  The statute was framed as \xe2\x80\x9ca procedural instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d we noted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the State\xe2\x80\x99s objective [wa]s manifestly substantive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gasperini</em>\xe2\x80\x99s observations apply with full force in this case.  By barring the recovery of statutory damages in a class action, \xc2\xa7901(b) controls a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s maximum liability in a suit seeking such a remedy.  The remedial provision could have been written as an explicit cap: \xe2\x80\x9cIn any class action seeking statutory damages, relief is limited to the amount the named plaintiff would have recovered in an individual suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  That New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature used other words to express the very same meaning should be inconsequential.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have long recognized the impropriety of displacing, in a diversity action, state-law limitations on state-created remedies.  See <em>Woods</em>, 337 U. S., at 538 (in a diversity case, a plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cbarred from recovery in the state court \xe2\x80\xa6 should likewise be barred in the federal court\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>York</em>, 326 U.

Just as <em>Erie</em> precludes a federal court from entering a deficiency judgment when a State has \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritatively announced that [such] judgments cannot be secured within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Angel</em> v. <em>Bullington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/183/index.html">330 U. S. 183</a>, 191 (1947), so too <em>Erie</em> should prevent a federal court from awarding statutory penalties aggregated through a class action when New York prohibits this recovery.  See also <em>Ragan</em>, 337 U. S., at 533 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere local law qualifies or abridges [a claim], the federal court must follow suit.  Otherwise there is a different measure of the cause of action in one court than in the other, and the principle of <em>Erie</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 is transgressed.\xe2\x80\x9d).

Shady Grove is able to pursue its claim in federal court only by virtue of the recent enactment of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d).  In CAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law-based class actions so long as there is minimal diversity, at least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in controversy.  <em>Ibid</em>.  By providing a federal forum, Congress sought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness of some state courts to certify class actions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x9314, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers from \xe2\x80\x9cgam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide or multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges have reputations for readily certifying classes.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>id.</em>, at 22 (disapproving \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98I never met a class action I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\xe2\x80\x99 approach to class certification\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cis prevalent in state courts in some localities\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, Congress envisioned fewer\xe2\x80\x94not more\xe2\x80\x94class actions overall.

[to] look to state rules and decisional law rather than to Rule 23 . . . in making their class certification decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 55.  This slippery-slope projection is both familiar and false.  Cf. R. Bork, The Tempting of America 169 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies; they are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this case, CPLR \xc2\xa7901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification, but Allstate does not contend that \xc2\xa7901(a) overrides Rule 23.  Brief for Respondent 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no dispute that the criteria for class certification under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground squarely occupied by Rule 23.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Federal courts sitting in diversity have routinely applied Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s certification standards, rather than comparable state provisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litigation</em>, 522 F.\xc2\xa03d 6, 18\xe2\x80\x9324 (CA1 2008); Order and Reasons in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation</em>, Civ.

Perhaps this silence indicates how very hard it would be to ascribe to \xc2\xa7901(b) <em>any</em> purpose bound up with the fairness and efficiency of processing cases.  On its face, the proscription is concerned with remedies, <em>i.e.</em>, the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit.  Legislative history confirms this objective, but is not essential to revealing it.  </p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0There is, of course, a difference between \xe2\x80\x9cjustly administering [a] remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sibbach</em> v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/1/index.html">312 U.

But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s relentless reading of Rule 23 today does exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of class-size statutory damages even though the New York provision instructs that such penalties shall not be available.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect our perception of legislative purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  But we can, of course, <em>interpret the</em> <em>Federal Rules</em> in light of a State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory policy to decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x937.  Just as we read Federal Rule 3 in <em>Walker </em>v.<em> Armco Steel Corp., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/740/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/740/index.html">446 U. S. 740</a>, 751 (1980), not to govern when a suit commences for purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule indisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural purposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action may be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages prescribed by state law.  On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of \xc2\xa7901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.  In discussing the remedial bar effected by \xc2\xa7901(b), the bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor explained that a<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cstatutory class action for actual damages would still be permissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.

On this understanding, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class waives its right to receive statutory penalties.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cox</em> v. <em>Microsoft Corp.</em>, 8 App. Div. 3d 39, 778 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 147 (2004); <em>Pesantez</em> v. <em>Boyle Env.
