This Court looks to the statute defining the crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 183\n, to determine whether the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 offenses involve fraud or deceit within the meaning of Clause (i).  Section 7206(1) provides that any person who \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully makes and subscribes any return .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,\xe2\x80\x9d shall be guilty of a felony.

Clause (i) is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.  Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or deceit\xe2\x80\x95meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct.  Mr. Kawashima\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under \xc2\xa77206(1) involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submitted a tax return that was false as to a material matter.  Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating \xc2\xa77206(2), which declares that any person who \xe2\x80\x9c[w]illfully aids or assists in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the preparation or presentation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of a return .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter\xe2\x80\x9d has committed a felony.

Clause (i) defines \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d to mean an offense that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clause (ii) defines \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d as an offense that is \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  Contrary to the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 claim, the difference in the clauses\xe2\x80\x99 language\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crevenue loss to the Government\xe2\x80\x9d in Clause (ii) compared to \xe2\x80\x9closs to the victim\xe2\x80\x9d in Clause (i)\xe2\x80\x94does not establish Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).  By its plain language, Clause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to tailor Clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s language to match the sole type of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)\xe2\x80\x99s broad scope.  Furthermore, interpreting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presumption against superfluities.  The specific inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the inclusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77201 was a deportable offense.

In 1997, Mr. Kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of willfully making and subscribing a false tax return in violation of \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77206(1).

That subparagraph classifies as an aggravated felony an offense that either: \xe2\x80\x9c(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or vic- tims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hereinafter, we refer to \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i) as \xe2\x80\x9cClause (i)\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as \xe2\x80\x9cClause (ii).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt their deportation hearing, the Kawashimas argued that their convictions under \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77206 did not qualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph\xc2\xa0(M).  The Immigration Judge disagreed and ordered removal, concluding that the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 convictions qualified as aggravated felonies under Clause\xc2\xa0(i).  The Kawashimas appealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision.

The Government responds that the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 convictions necessarily in- volved deceit because they required a showing that the Kawashimas willfully made materially false statements.  To determine whether the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 offenses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] fraud or deceit\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Clause\xc2\xa0(i), we employ a categorical approach by looking to the statute defining the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.

If the elements of the offenses establish that the Kawashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit, then the first requirement of Clause\xc2\xa0(i) is satisfied.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMr. Kawashima was convicted of violating \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77206(1), which provides that any person who \xe2\x80\x9c[w]illfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,\xe2\x80\x9d shall be guilty of a felony.  Mr. Ka- washima does not dispute that the elements of a violation of \xc2\xa77206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in question was false as to a material matter, that the defendant did not believe the document to be true and correct as to every material matter, and that he acted willfully with the specific intent to violate the law.  See, e.g., United States v. Aramony, 88 F.\xc2\xa03d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v. Kaiser, 893 F.\xc2\xa02d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.

The scope of that clause is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.

Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77206(2), which declares that any person who \xe2\x80\x9c[w]illfully aids or assists in\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter,\xe2\x80\x9d has committed a felony.  Mrs. Kawashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation of \xc2\xa77206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in question was false as to a material matter and that the defendant acted willfully.  See Aramony, supra, at 1382; United States v. Sassak, 881 F.\xc2\xa02d 276, 278 (CA6 1989); United States v. Hooks, 848 F.\xc2\xa02d 785, 788\xe2\x80\x93789 (CA7 1988); United States v.

We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima\xe2\x80\x99s conviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully assisting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s filing of a materially false tax return, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that involved \xe2\x80\x9cdeceit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe language of Clause\xc2\xa0(i) is clear.

In their view, subparagraph\xc2\xa0(M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates that Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive categories of crimes in subparagraph (M)\xe2\x80\x99s two clauses: general, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that cause actual losses to real victims in Clause\xc2\xa0(i), and tax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government in Clause\xc2\xa0(ii).  For the reasons discussed below, this argument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause (i), which encompasses the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 offenses of conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Kawashimas contend that textual differences between Clauses\xc2\xa0(i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended to exclude tax crimes from Clause\xc2\xa0(i).  Specifically, they note that Clause\xc2\xa0(i) addresses \xe2\x80\x9closs to the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) addresses \xe2\x80\x9crevenue loss to the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis difference in language does not establish Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause\xc2\xa0(i).  Clause\xc2\xa0(i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit.  Clause\xc2\xa0(i) thus uses correspondingly broad language to refer to the wide range of potential losses and victims.  Clause\xc2\xa0(ii), on the other hand, is limited to the single type of offense \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion),\xe2\x80\x9d which, by definition, can only cause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim (the Government).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to tailor Clause\xc2\xa0(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s language to match the sole type of offense covered by Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also intended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of Clause\xc2\xa0(i)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting Clause\xc2\xa0(i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption against superfluities by rendering Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) completely redundant to Clause\xc2\xa0(i).  Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) explicitly states that convictions for tax evasion pursuant to \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77201 that cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Government are aggravated felonies.  The Kawashimas assert that, if Clause\xc2\xa0(i) applies to tax crimes, then qualifying convictions for tax evasion under Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) would also qualify as aggravated felonies under Clause\xc2\xa0(i), because tax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit.  To buttress this argument, the Kawashimas point to a body of law providing that a conviction for tax evasion under \xc2\xa77201 collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from contesting a civil penalty under \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76663(b) for \xe2\x80\x9cunderpayment\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. attributable to fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., Gray v. Commissioner, 708 F.\xc2\xa02d 243, 246 (CA6 1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cNumerous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal income tax evasion, either upon a plea of guilty, or upon a jury verdict of guilt, conclusively establishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, according to the Kawashimas, if Clause\xc2\xa0(i) covers tax offenses, then Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) is mere surplusage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t We disagree with the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the specific mention of one type of tax crime in Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) impliedly limits the scope of Clause\xc2\xa0(i)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, which extends to any offense that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves fraud or deceit.\xe2\x80\x9d  We think it more likely that Congress specifically included tax evasion offenses under \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77201 in Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies as an aggravated felony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral considerations support this conclusion.  Like \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77206(1) and (2), \xc2\xa77201 does not, on its face, mention fraud or deceit.  Instead, \xc2\xa77201 simply provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by [the Internal Revenue Code] or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, neither fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction under \xc2\xa77201, which include: (1) willfulness; (2) the existence of a tax deficiency; and (3) an affirmative act constituting an evasion or an attempted evasion of the tax.  Boulware v. United States, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421\n, n.\xc2\xa02 (2008).  A conviction under \xc2\xa77201, therefore, only qualifies as an aggravated felony under Clause\xc2\xa0(i) if a willful, affirmative attempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in United States v. Scharton, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518 (1932)\n, gave Congress good reason to doubt that a conviction under \xc2\xa77201 satisfies that condition.  In Scharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to evade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable income.  The question before the Court was whether the crime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations generally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was instead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations applicable to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98offenses involving the defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 520, n.\xc2\xa02 (quoting \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).  The Government argued that the 6-year statute of limitations applied because \xe2\x80\x9cfraud is implicit in the concept of evading or defeating\xe2\x80\x9d and because any effort to evade a tax is tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 520\xe2\x80\x93521.  The Court rejected that argument, noting that, in an indictment for evasion, \xe2\x80\x9can averment [of intent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be sufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade or defeat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 521.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, \xc2\xa77201 includes two offenses: \xe2\x80\x9cthe offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a tax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the payment of a tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sansone v. United States, \n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343, \n354 (1965)\n (emphasis in original).  As the Government notes, it is possible to willfully evade or de- feat payment of a tax under \xc2\xa77201 without making any misrepresentation.  For example, \xc2\xa77201 can be violated by a taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also takes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his assets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.  Although the Government concedes that evasion-of-payment cases will almost invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the elements of tax evasion pursuant to \xc2\xa77201 do not necessarily involve fraud or deceit.  Thus, we conclude that the specific inclusion of tax evasion in Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to \xc2\xa77201 was a deportable offense.  Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) does not implicitly remove all other tax offenses from the scope of Clause\xc2\xa0(i)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Kawashimas also assert that the separate treatment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit in the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their contention that Congress did not intend to include tax crimes within Clause\xc2\xa0(i).  They point to the fact that, in 1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included within the Guidelines a category of \xe2\x80\x9coffenses involving fraud or deceit.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effec- tive Nov. 1, 2001).  The Commission simultaneously included \xe2\x80\x9coffenses involving taxation\xe2\x80\x9d as a separate category.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011).  Although the Kawashimas acknowledge that they have found no evidence that Congress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend that \xe2\x80\x9cit is likely that the language of [Clause\xc2\xa0(i)] and [Clause\xc2\xa0(ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d by the sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of aggravated felony to include subparagraph\xc2\xa0(M).  Brief for Petitioners 29.  Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer from the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress did not intend Clause\xc2\xa0(i) to include tax crimes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reject the Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the Guidelines.  The Kawashimas\xe2\x80\x99 argument is at odds with the fact that, unlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) does not refer to all offenses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving taxation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, Clause\xc2\xa0(ii) is expressly limited to tax evasion offenses under \xc2\xa77201.  That textual difference undercuts any inference that Congress was considering, much less incorporating, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph\xc2\xa0(M)\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambiguous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in their favor.  It is true that we have, in the past, construed ambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  See INS v. St. Cyr, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289, \n320 (2001)\n.

Because the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies pursuant to \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0On March 1, 2003, most of the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service ceased to exist.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the country: \xe2\x80\x9cdeportation\xe2\x80\x9d of aliens who were already present, and \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion\xe2\x80\x9d of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country.

United States, \n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343, \n351 (1965)\n.  As this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or fraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax liability or misleading the Government as to the extent of the liability.  See, e.g., Spies v. United States, \n\n317 U. S. 492, \n499 (1943)\n (an act of tax evasion may be \xe2\x80\x9cany conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, courts have determined that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessarily involves fraud.  See, e.g., Carty v.

S., at 497, 499; see Boulware v. United States, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421, \n424 (2008)\n.  Tellingly, the Kawashimas pleaded guilty to a crime carrying a maximum prison term of three years, \xc2\xa77206; for tax evasion, the maximum term is five years, \xc2\xa77201.  It is thus understandable that Congress would single out tax evasion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and no other tax crime, an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d for deportation purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).  Tax evasion, made criminal by \xc2\xa77201, the Court states, \xe2\x80\x9calmost invariably,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud or deceit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  But see supra, at 4 and this page.  Congress likely included Clause (ii), the Court suggests, simply \xe2\x80\x9cto remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies as an aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  In other words, in holding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court finds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn support of the notion that tax evasion can occur without fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v. Scharton, \n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518 (1932)\n; see ante, at 9.  In that long-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s plea for the application of an extended limitation period to a prosecution for tax evasion.  The generally applicable statute of limitations was three years; for tax offenses that involve defrauding the United States, however, the limitation period was six years.  An averment of intent to defraud, the Court said in Scharton, would be \xe2\x80\x9csurplusage,\xe2\x80\x9d for it would suffice \xe2\x80\x9cto plead and prove a wilful attempt to evade or defeat.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 521.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCourts had limited Scharton to its statute of limita- tions context several decades before Congress enacted \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M) in 1994.  See Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 247 F.\xc2\xa02d 929, 936, n. 6 (CA9 1957) (distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude because it entails fraud); Lefkowitz, 334 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 265 (distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion necessarily involves fraud).  Moreover, Congress, since 1954, has expressly prescribed a six-year limitation period for tax evasion.  See \n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76531(2).  In short, Scharton is a cryptic, thinly reasoned opinion, one that did not influence subsequent federal-court description of the crime of tax evasion.  The suggestion that Congress may have worried about Scharton when framing legislation over 60 years later is hardly credible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court presents another reason, drawn from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, why Congress may have treated tax evasion discretely, while embracing tax crimes generally within the Clause (i) category.  Section 7201 covers both evasion of assessment and evasion of payment.  Imagine a taxpayer who files a truthful return, then moves her assets to a place \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10; see Brief for Respondent 34.  The Court acknowledges that evasion-of-payment cases almost always \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  Still, there may be a rare case in which that is not so.  Rare, indeed; imaginary would be an apt char- acterization.  The Government conceded that, to its knowledge, there have been no actual instances of indictments for tax evasion unaccompanied by any act of fraud or deceit.

We have declined to interpret legislation in a way that \xe2\x80\x9cwould in practical effect render [a provision] entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19, \n29 (2001)\n.  It is hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a case in which the provision might have some independent role.  See id., at 30.  Where, as here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government concede[s] that the independent function one could attribute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,\xe2\x80\x9d a construction moored to a case \xe2\x80\x9cmost unlikely\xe2\x80\x9d to exist should be rejected.

See Fong Haw Tan, 333 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10.  It is implausible that Congress, when drafting \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M), intended to address, or was even aware of, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s scenario: a taxpayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collection of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore.  Far more likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offenses in \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision to address fraudulent schemes against private victims, then added \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the \xe2\x80\x9ccapstone\xe2\x80\x9d tax offense against the Government also qualified as an aggravated felony.

If a \xc2\xa77206 charge carries the same prospect of deportation as a \xc2\xa77201 charge, then an alien\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to plead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, I would hold that making a material, false statement on a tax return does not qualify as an aggravated felony within the compass of \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i).  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See also, e.g., Blohm v.
