S. 399</a></p><p> variation of risk, to equalize which the 8th article of the present rules of the society requires an additional percentage to be paid by the present members of the company, in conformity to what is to be imposed upon subsequent applicants for insurance.  And it is contended that, the contract being complete between the parties, the insurers cannot add to the consideration to be paid for insurance.  In general, this doctrine is unquestionably correct, but peculiar circumstances except this from ordinary cases.  This subject was considered in the quoted case decided between these same parties in February, 1810.  It is there laid down, and on reflection we are confirmed in the opinion, that in the capacity of an individual of the body corporate, the defendants are bound by the bylaws of the society as far as is consistent with the nature of its institution.</p>\n<p>This case is within the 4th section of the 8th article of those bylaws, and therefore the judgment below ought to have been for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
