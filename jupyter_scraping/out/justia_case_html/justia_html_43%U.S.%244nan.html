F. Cook," deputy marshal; he had a conversation with him a short time after the judgment was rendered, say sometime in the month of November, 1839, in which he notified the said Cook distinctly that good money would be required to be collected on said judgment, and that he must receive no other kind of money on the execution, when it should come into his hands.  That he saw said Cook several times during the ensuing winter, but that he (Cook) never mentioned to him that he had made any collection on said judgment.

Witness further stated, that at the time referred to (May, 1840), said post notes had greatly depreciated in value, and were not worth more than fifty cents to the dollar, and that on 17 February, 1840, said post notes were worth but seventy-five cents to the dollar.  That he immediately entered a motion to quash said return of the said deputy marshal (Cook), which motion was sustained by the court at its November term, 1841.  Witness further stated that in a conversation he had held with said Thomas Griffin, he (Griffin) had stated that the $800 mentioned in said receipt, dated 10 December, 1839, and the $200 mentioned in said receipt, dated 17 February, 1840, constituting together the $1,000 returned as made on 2 January, 1840, in "post notes of the Mississippi Union Bank," were paid by him to said John F. Cook, deputy marshal as aforesaid, at times mentioned in the said receipts respectively, in post notes of the said Mississippi Union Bank.  It was also in proof that, on 10 December, 1839, the post notes of the Mississippi Union Bank were current in the State of Mississippi, and were generally received by the sheriffs and marshal unless instructions to the contrary were given by plaintiffs or their attorneys.  It was also admitted that Griffin had no actual notice of the instructions given by the plaintiff\'s attorney in this case to said John F. Cook, deputy marshal.  This was all the evidence offered either in support or in opposition to the plaintiff\'s motion.  Whereupon on the question whether satisfaction should be entered on said execution of <em>fieri facias,</em> which was sued out on 4 June, 1840, in favor of said Robert Thompson v. Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin for the sum of $1,740.02 with interest and costs as aforesaid, and also on the question whether said execution of <em>fieri facias</em> which was sued out against the said Griffin and Ervin on 6 November, 1841, should be quashed, the judges were opposed in opinion, and the questions were ordered to be certified to this Court for decision. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 43 U.

S. 256</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DANIEL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This Court is unable to perceive upon what principle of law either of the objects sought by the motion of the plaintiffs in the circuit court could have been accorded to them.  It cannot be questioned that the defendant in that motion was entitled to the full benefit and operation of his execution, and these were to cause to be made for him of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of his debtor, the sum of $1,740.02 of lawful money of the United States.  With his claim thus solemnly ascertained of record, we are aware of no authority, from any source, which can compel him to commute it, or to receive in satisfaction thereof any other thing which he shall not voluntarily elect.  But least of all should such an authority be recognized in a quarter more fruitful than any other of abuses in its exercise -- for instance, from the will either of the debtor or the officer whose position would enable him in some degree to practice on both creditor and debtor.  To permit either the debtor or the officer to impose upon the creditor the receipt of depreciated paper in payment would be to permit not merely a repeal of the judgment, but a violation, a virtual abrogation indeed, of the contract on which it was founded, for none can fail to perceive the thousand fraudulent devices for profit or favor which the toleration of such a practice would naturally call into action to defeat the rights of creditors.  The courts of justice might thus be made to subserve only the purposes of dishonesty and be transformed into engines of monstrous wrong.  It has been argued in support of this motion that banknotes constitute good and lawful payment if received; that as the law recognizes their circulation, debtors may lawfully tender them in payment, and creditors, may lawfully receive them though not legally bound to do so.  From these postulates it is then attempted to draw the following conclusions:  1. That the marshal is the plaintiff\'s agent, who by the execution may receive the plaintiff\'s debt.  2. That he who may lawfully receive payment, may have a lawful tender of payment made to him.  3. That if a tender or payment of banknotes to the principal, not by him objected to, is a good tender or payment, the like tender or payment to the agent is equally good.  This argument, to say the least of it, is wholly untenable.  \'Tis undoubtedly true that the creditor may receive either banknotes or blank paper in satisfaction of his debt, for the reason that his power over that debt is supreme, and he may release it without payment of any kind, if he think proper.  But the fallacy of the argument here </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 43 U. S. 257</a></p><p> consists in totally misconceiving the situation and functions of the marshal.  He is properly the officer of the law, rather than the agent of the parties, and is bound to fulfill the behests of the law, and this too without special instruction or admonition from any person.  If, then, when commanded to levy a sum of money, he make a return that he has not done this, but has of his own mere will substituted for money depreciated banknotes, his return is an admission on oath that he has both disobeyed his orders and transcended his powers, for legally he has no powers save those he derives from the precept he is ordered to obey.  Can it be doubted that upon application from those whose interests are involved in the performance of his duties by the marshal, it is the right and the duty of the court in such a case to correct the irregularities of its officer and to compel him to perform his duty?  There is inherent in every court a power to supervise the conduct of its officers and the execution of its judgments and process.  Without this power, courts would be wholly impotent and useless.  The returns of the marshal in this case upon the final process in his hands, showing the receipt by him of depreciated bank paper in satisfaction of that process which ordered him to collect money, are held to be departures from the performance of his duty as plainly enjoined by the process itself, are deemed therefore illegal and void, and ought, upon the application of the party injured thereby, to have been set aside and annulled by the court.  In conformity with the principles herein sanctioned, we therefore order it to be certified to the judges of the Circuit Court for the Southern District of Mississippi that satisfaction should not be entered on the execution of <em>fieri facias</em> which was sued out in this case on 4 June, 1840, in favor of the said Robert Thompson v. the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin, for the sum of $1,740.02 with interest and costs, and further that the execution of <em>fi. fa.</em> which was sued out against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin on the sixth day of November, 1841, should not be quashed, and that the motion of the plaintiff in the circuit court should be</p>\n<p><em>Overruled.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi, and on the points and questions on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion, and which were certified to this Court for its opinion agreeably to the act of Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 43 U. S. 258</a></p><p> in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that satisfaction should not be entered on the execution of <em>fieri facias,</em> which was sued out in this case on 4 June, 1840, in favor of the said Robert Thompson against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin for the sum of $1,740.02, with interest and costs, and further that the execution of <em>fi. fa.</em> which was sued out against the said Thomas Griffin and Hugh Ervin on 6 November, 1841, should not be quashed, and that the motion of the plaintiff in the circuit court should be overruled.  Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged that it be so certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
