The fourth bill of exceptions was to the opinion of the court given to the jury at the request of the plaintiff, that if at the time the brig sailed from Tobago for Curracoa, the latter island was not a blockaded port by notification of the British government to the American nation, but was blockaded in fact, and if the master was ignorant of such blockade until he was warned off by the blockading force, and being so warned he did not again attempt to enter the blockaded port, but changed his course intending to come directly to Norfolk, and in the prosecution of such voyage to Norfolk was captured by a French cruiser, and recaptured by an English vessel, carried into Jamaica, libeled, condemned and sold under a decree of the vice-admiralty court of that island, then such sailing from Tobago for Curracoa and from thence to Norfolk was a lawful voyage within the meaning of the contract of insurance, and not within the exception in the policy, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the underwriters an indemnity for the loss sustained by such capture, recapture and sale. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 9 U.

S. 341</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows, <em>viz.,</em></p>\n<p>The material question in this case grows out of an exception in a policy of insurance.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff insured a specified sum on the brig <em>Richard,</em> belonging to the defendant, "at and from Tobago to one or more ports in the West Indies, and at the from thence to Norfolk," and the insurance is declared to be made against "all risks, blockaded ports and Hispaniola excepted."</p>\n<p>The <em>Richard</em> sailed from Tobago for Curracoa, which was then blockaded in fact, but the blockade was not known at Tobago when the vessel sailed, nor was it known to the captain until he was warned off by a British ship of war.  He then sailed for Norfolk, but on his voyage was captured by a French privateer, by whom the vessel was plundered to a considerable extent and ordered to St. Domingo for trial.</p>\n<p>The question is whether this risk comes within the exception contained in the policy.</p>\n<p>The counsel has considered the exception as a warranty, but the Court cannot so consider it.  The words are the words of the insurer, not of the insured, and they take a particular risk out of the policy which, but for the exception, would be comprehended in the contract. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 9 U. S. 342</a></p><p></p>\n<p>What is that risk?</p>\n<p>Policies of insurance are generally the most informal instruments which are brought into courts of justice, and there are no instruments which are more liberally construed in order to effect the real intention of the parties if that intention can be clearly ascertained.</p>\n<p>In that part of the policy on which the present controversy depends a few words are given, to which others must be subjoined in order to complete the sense and give a full description of the risk against which the underwriters were unwilling to insure.  These words are, "blockaded ports and Hispaniola excepted."</p>\n<p>It is reasonable to suppose that a voyage to Hispaniola was not insured.  The assured has notice of this, and if he sails for Hispaniola, the voyage is entirely at his own risk.  Against the risks of such a voyage, whatever they may be, the underwriters will not insure.  It is a specified place excluded by consent from the policy.  The perils attending the voyage are understood, whether they arise from the sea or otherwise, and are all excepted.  The motives for making the exception do not appear, nor can they be inferred from the instrument.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in error contends that the same reasoning applies in its full extent to the exception of blockaded ports, but the Court does not think so.</p>\n<p>Hispaniola is excepted absolutely from the policy, but other ports are within the terms of the voyage insured if they be not blockaded.  It is their character as blockaded ports which excludes them from the insurance.  Their being excepted by this character is thought to justify the opinion that it is the risk attending this character which produces the exception and which is the risk excepted.  The risk of a blockaded port, as a blockaded port, is the risk incurred by breaking the blockade.  This is defined </p><p><a class="page-number" name="343">Page 9 U. S. 343</a></p><p> by public law.  Sailing from Tobago for Curracoa, knowing Curracoa to be blockaded, would have incurred this risk, but sailing for that port without such knowledge did not incur it.</p>\n<p>The underwriter had no objection to a voyage to Curracoa other than might arise from its being blockaded.  The dangers of the blockade, therefore, were the particular dangers which induced the exception, and it seems to the Court that the exception ought not to be extended beyond them.  If this be correct, the circuit court committed no error in refusing to give the opinion which was required by the counsel on this point.</p>\n<p>The sentence in this case is sufficiently authenticated to be received as evidence.  Being a court acting under the law of nations, its proceedings may be proved according to the mode observed in the present case, and were this doubtful, that doubt would be removed by the circumstance that it is the form stipulated by treaty.</p>\n<p>The defendant is not at liberty to except to his own depositions, because he does not produce proof of his having given notice to the plaintiff.  The admission of notice by the plaintiff is certainly sufficient, if notice to him was necessary, to enable him to use the defendant\'s deposition.</p>\n<p>The fourth bill of exceptions depends on the principles stated by the Court in the first part of this opinion.</p>\n<p>There is no error in the judgment of the circuit court, and it is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
