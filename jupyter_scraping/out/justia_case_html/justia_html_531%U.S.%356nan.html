Although "negative attitudes" and "fear" often accompany irrational biases, their presence alone does not a constitutional violation make. Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment does not require States to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational. They could quite hardheadedly-and perhaps hardheartedly-hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 365-368.</p><p>(c) The requirements for private individuals to recover money damages against the States-that there be state discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the remedy imposed by Congress be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation-are not met here. First, the ADA\'s legislative record fails to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of irrational employment discrimination by the States against the disabled. See, <i>e. g., Kimel, supra, </i>at 89. Because Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to local governmental units such as cities and counties, see <i>Lincoln County </i>v. <i>Luning, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/133/529/case.html">133 U. S. 529</a>, 530, the Court rejects respondents\' contention that the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend to such units as well as to States.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(a)(2). Although the record includes instances to support such a finding, the great majority of these incidents do not deal with state activities in employment. Even if it were to be determined that the half a dozen relevant examples from the record showed unconstitutional action on the part of States, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which \xc2\xa7 5 legislation must be based.

OF ALA. <i>v. </i>GARRETT</p><p align="center">\nSyllabus</p><p>remedies created by the ADA against the States raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in <i>City of Boerne, supra. </i>For example, while it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12112(5)(B), 12111(9). The ADA does except employers from the "reasonable accommodatio[n]" requirement where the employer can demonstrate that accommodation would impose an "undue hardship" upon it, \xc2\xa7 12112(b)(5)(A), but, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required. The ADA\'s constitutional shortcomings are apparent when it is compared to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Holding the latter Act to be "appropriate" legislation to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment\'s protection against racial discrimination in voting, <i>South Carolina </i>v. <i>Katzenbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html">383 U. S. 301</a>, this Court emphasized that Congress had there documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States, see id., at 312, and had determined that litigation had proved ineffective to remedy the problem, see id., at 313. The contrast between the kind of evidence detailed in <i>Katzenbach, </i>and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. To uphold the ADA\'s application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in <i>Cleburne. </i>Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge congressional authority.

See Brief for Petitioners i; Brief for United States I. Though the briefs of the parties discuss both sections in their constitutional arguments, no party has briefed the question whether Title II of the ADA, dealing with the "services, programs, or activities of a public entity," 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12132, is available for claims of employment discrimination when Title I of the ADA expressly deals with that subject. See, <i>e. g., Russello </i>v. <i>United States, 464 </i>U. S. 16, 23 (1983) ("[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue, compare <i>Zimmerman </i>v. <i>Oregon Dept. of Justice, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/170/1169/">170 F.3d 1169</a> <i>(CA9 </i>1999), with <i>Bledsoe </i>v. <i>Palm Beach Cty.

We are not disposed to decide the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when the parties have not favored us with briefing on the statutory question. To the extent the Court granted certiorari on the question whether respondents may sue their state employers for damages under Title II of the ADA, see this Court\'s Rule 24.1(a), that portion of the writ is dismissed as improvidently granted. See <i>The Monrosa </i>v. <i>Carbon Black Export, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/180/case.html">359 U.

To this end, the Act requires employers to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [employer\'s] business." \xc2\xa7 12112(b)(5)(A).</p><blockquote><p>\n"\'[R]easonable accommodation\' may include-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and (B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." \xc2\xa7 12111(9).</p></blockquote><p>The Act also prohibits employers from "utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration ... that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability." \xc2\xa7 12112(b)(3)(A).</p><p>The Act defines "disability" to include "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." \xc2\xa7 12102(2). A disabled individual is otherwise "qualified" if he or she, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." \xc2\xa7 12111(8).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="362">362</a></p><p>362 BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF UN IV. OF ALA. <i>v. </i>GARRETT</p><p>Respondent Patricia Garrett, a registered nurse, was employed as the Director of Nursing, OB/Gyn/Neonatal Services, for the University of Alabama in Birmingham Hospital. See App. 31, 38. In 1994, Garrett was diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently underwent a lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. See id., at 38. Garrett\'s treatments required her to take substantial leave from work. Upon returning to work in July 1995, Garrett\'s supervisor informed Garrett that she would have to give up her Director position. See id., at 39. Garrett then applied for and received a transfer to another, lower paying position as a nurse manager. See ibid.</p><p>Respondent Milton Ash worked as a security officer for the Alabama Department of Youth Services (Department). See id., at 8. Upon commencing this employment, Ash informed the Department that he suffered from chronic asthma and that his doctor recommended he avoid carbon monoxide and cigarette smoke, and Ash requested that the Department modify his duties to minimize his exposure to these substances. See ibid. Ash was later diagnosed with sleep apnea and requested, again pursuant to his doctor\'s recommendation, that he be reassigned to daytime shifts to accommodate his condition. See id., at 9. Ultimately, the Department granted none of the requested relief. See id., at 8-9. Shortly after Ash filed a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he noticed that his performance evaluations were lower than those he had received on previous occasions. See id., at 9.</p><p>Garrett and Ash filed separate lawsuits in the District Court, both seeking money damages under the ADA.2 Petitioners moved for summary judgment, claiming that the ADA exceeds Congress\' authority to abrogate the State\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity.

If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.5</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Once we have determined the metes and bounds of the constitutional right in question, we examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States against the disabled. Just as \xc2\xa7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to actions committed "under color of state law," Congress\' \xc2\xa7 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions. See <i>Florida Prepaid, </i>527 U. S., at 640 ("It is this conduct then-unremedied patent infringement by the States-that must give rise to the Fourteenth Amendment violation that Congress sought to redress in the Patent Remedy Act"); <i>Kimel, </i>528 U. S., at 89 ("Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the States, much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation"). The legislative record of the ADA, however, simply fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.</p><p>Respondents contend that the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend not only to States themselves, but to units of local governments, such as cities and counties. All of these, they say, are "state actors" for</p><p>5 It is worth noting that by the time that Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, every State in the Union had enacted such measures. At least one Member of Congress remarked that "this is probably one of the few times where the States are so far out in front of the Federal Government, it\'s not funny." Hearing on Discrimination Against Cancer Victims and the Handicapped before the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1987). A number of these provisions, however, did not go as far as the ADA did in requiring accommodation.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="369">369</a></p><p>purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brief for Respondents 8. This is quite true, but the Eleventh Amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government. See <i>Lincoln County </i>v. <i>Luning, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/133/529/case.html">133 U. S. 529</a>, 530 (1890). These entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ADA without Congress\' ever having to rely on \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to render them so. lt would make no sense to consider constitutional violations on their part, as well as by the States themselves, when only the States are the beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment.</p><p>Congress made a general finding in the ADA that "historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(a)(2). The record assembled by Congress includes many instances to support such a finding. But the great majority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of States.</p><p>Respondents in their brief cite half a dozen examples from the record that did involve States. A department head at the University of North Carolina refused to hire an applicant for the position of health administrator because he was blind; similarly, a student at a state university in South Dakota was denied an opportunity to practice teach because the dean at that time was convinced that blind people could not teach in public schools. A microfilmer at the Kansas Department of Transportation was fired because he had epilepsy; deaf workers at the University of Oklahoma were paid a lower salary than those who could hear. The Indiana State Personnel Office informed a woman with a concealed disability that she should not disclose it if she wished to obtain employment.6</p><p>6 The record does show that some States, adopting the tenets of the eugenics movement of the early part of this century, required extreme measures such as sterilization of persons suffering from hereditary mental disease. These laws were upheld against constitutional attack 70 years ago in <i>Buck </i>v. <i>Bell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/200/case.html">274 U. S. 200</a> (1927). But there is no indication that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="370">370</a></p><p>370 BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF UN IV. OF ALA. <i>v. </i>GARRETT</p><p>Several of these incidents undoubtedly evidence an unwillingness on the part of state officials to make the sort of accommodations for the disabled required by the ADA. Whether they were irrational under our decision in <i>Cleburne </i>is more debatable, particularly when the incident is described out of context. But even if it were to be determined that each incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitutional action on the part of the State, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which \xc2\xa7 5 legislation must be based. See <i>Kimel, supra, </i>at 89-91; <i>City of Boerne, 521 </i>U. S., at 530-531. Congress, in enacting the ADA, found that "some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(a)(1). In 1990, the States alone employed more than 4.5 million people. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 338 (119th ed. 1999) (Table 534). It is telling, we think, that given these large numbers, Congress assembled only such minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against the disabled.</p><p>JUSTICE BREYER maintains that Congress applied Title I of the ADA to the States in response to a host of incidents representing unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities. A close review of the relevant materials, however, undercuts that conclusion. JUSTICE BREYER\'S Appendix C consists not of legislative findings, but of unexamined, anecdotal accounts of "adverse, disparate treatment by state officials." <i>Post, </i>at 379. Of course, as we have already explained, "adverse, disparate treatment" often does not amount to a constitutional violation where rational-basis scrutiny applies. These accounts, moreover, were submitted not directly to Congress but to the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of</p><p>any State had persisted in requiring such harsh measures as of 1990 when the ADA was adopted.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="371">371</a></p><p>Americans with Disabilities, which made no findings on the subject of state discrimination in employment.7 See the Task Force\'s Report entitled From ADA to Empowerment (Oct. 12, 1990). And, had Congress truly understood this information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the States, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act\'s legislative findings. There is none. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101. Although JUSTICE BREYER would infer from Congress\' general conclusions regarding societal discrimination against the disabled that the States had likewise participated in such action, <i>post, </i>at 378, the House and Senate committee reports on the ADA flatly contradict this assertion. After describing the evidence presented to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and its subcommittee (including the Task Force Report upon which the dissent relies), the Committee\'s Report reached, among others, the following conclusion: "Discrimination still persists in such critical areas as <i>employment in the private sector, </i>public accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications." S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 6 (1989) (emphasis added). The House Committee on Education and Labor, addressing the ADA\'s employment provisions, reached the same conclusion: "[A]fter extensive review and analysis over a number of Congressional sessions, ... there exists a compelling need to establish a clear and comprehensive Federal prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of <i>employment in the private sector, </i>public accommodations, public services, transporta-</p><p>7 Only a small fraction of the anecdotes JUSTICE BREYER identifies in his Appendix C relate to state discrimination against the disabled in employment. At most, somewhere around 50 of these allegations describe conduct that could conceivably amount to constitutional violations by the States, and most of them are so general and brief that no firm conclusion can be drawn. The overwhelming majority of these accounts pertain to alleged discrimination by the States in the provision of public services and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in Titles II and III of the ADA.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="372">372</a></p><p>372 BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF UN IV. OF ALA. <i>v. </i>GARRETT</p><p>tion, and telecommunications." H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 28 (1990) (emphasis added). Thus, not only is the inference JUSTICE BREYER draws unwarranted, but there is also strong evidence that Congress\' failure to mention States in its legislative findings addressing discrimination in employment reflects that body\'s judgment that no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented.</p><p>Even were it possible to squeeze out of these examples a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the States, the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in City <i>of Boerne, </i>supra. For example, whereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to "mak[e] existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12112(5)(B), 12111(9). The ADA does except employers from the "reasonable accommodatio[n]" requirement where the employer "can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." \xc2\xa7 12112(b)(5)(A). However, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternative responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an "undue burden" upon the employer. The Act also makes it the employer\'s duty to prove that it would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer\'s decision. See ibid.</p><p>The ADA also forbids "utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration" that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a rational basis. \xc2\xa7 12112(b)(3)(A). Although disparate impact may be</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="373">373</a></p><p>relevant evidence of racial discrimination, see <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 239 (1976), such evidence alone is insufficient even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny. See, <i>e. g., ibid. </i>("[O]ur cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional <i>solely </i>because it has a racially disproportionate impact").</p><p>The ADA\'s constitutional shortcomings are apparent when the Act is compared to Congress\' efforts in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to respond to a serious pattern of constitutional violations. In <i>South Carolina </i>v. <i>Katzenbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/case.html">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966), we considered whether the Voting Rights Act was "appropriate" legislation to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment\'s protection against racial discrimination in voting. Concluding that it was a valid exercise of Congress\' enforcement power under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment,8 we noted that "[b]efore enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting." <i>Id., </i>at 308.</p><p>In that Act, Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States. State officials, Congress found, routinely applied voting tests in order to exclude African-American citizens from registering to vote. See id., at 312. Congress also determined that litigation had proved ineffective and that there persisted an otherwise inexplicable 50-percentage-point gap in the registration of white and African-American voters in some States. See id., at 313. Congress\' response was to promulgate in the Voting Rights Act a detailed but limited remedial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment in those areas of the Nation where abundant evidence of States\' systematic denial of those rights was identified.</p><p>8 Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is virtually identical to \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="374">374</a></p><p>374 BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF UN IV. OF ALA. <i>v. </i>GARRETT</p><p>The contrast between this kind of evidence, and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. Congressional enactment of the ADA represents its judgment that there should be a "comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(b)(1). Congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy, but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the States, there must be a pattern of discrimination by the States which violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation. Those requirements are not met here, and to uphold the Act\'s application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in <i>Cleburne.</i>9 Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge congressional authority. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore</p><p>Reversed.</p><p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE O\'CONNOR joins, concurring.</p><p>Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone. It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves. Quite apart from any historical documentation,</p><p>9 Our holding here that Congress did not validly abrogate the States\' sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under Title I does not mean that persons with disabilities have no federal recourse against discrimination. Title I of the ADA still prescribes standards applicable to the States. Those standards can be enforced by the United States in actions for money damages, as well as by private individuals in actions for injunctive relief under <i>Ex parte Young, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908). In addition, state laws protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in employment and other aspects of life provide independent avenues of redress. See n. 5, <i>supra.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="375">375</a></p><p>knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature. There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.</p><p>One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society. The law works this way because the law can be a teacher. So I do not doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society.</p><p>It is a question of quite a different order, however, to say that the States in their official capacities, the States as governmental entities, must be held in violation of the Constitution on the assumption that they embody the misconceived or malicious perceptions of some of their citizens. It is a most serious charge to say a State has engaged in a pattern or practice designed to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws, particularly where the accusation is based not on hostility but instead on the failure to act or the omission to remedy. States can, and do, stand apart from the citizenry. States act as neutral entities, ready to take instruction and to enact laws when their citizens so demand. The failure of a State to revise policies now seen as incorrect under a new understanding of proper policy does not always constitute the purposeful and intentional action required to make out a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, <i>infra), </i>and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, <i>infra), </i>Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.

The task force hearings, Congress\' own hearings, and an analysis of "census data, national polls, and other studies" led Congress to conclude that "people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally." 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(a)(6). As to employment, Congress found that "[t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all," even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively. S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 9. And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from "stereotypic assumptions" as well as "purposeful unequal treatment." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 12101(a)(7).</p><p>The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society. There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the "stereotypic assumptions" and pattern of "purposeful unequal treatment" that Congress found prevalent. The Court claims that it "make[s] no sense" to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments. <i>Ante, </i>at 369. But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike. <i>E. g., Richmond </i>v. J. <i>A.

Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.

They reveal, not what the Court describes as "half a dozen" instances of discrimination, <i>ante, </i>at 369, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment. State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in <i>Cleburne, </i>473 U.

And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusions-for example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate need-from anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation. See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force "met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA," and as to the general public, although the task force received "about 2,000 letters" in support of the ADA, there was only "one letter in opposition"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost "less than $50," and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is "frequently exaggerated").

S. 641, 652-656 (1966) (asking whether Congress\' likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record). Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category. Compare <i>ante, </i>at 371-372 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with <i>Morgan, supra, </i>at 654 (considering what Congress "might" have concluded); 384 U.

And the Court itself points out that, when economic or social legislation is challenged in court as irrational, hence unconstitutional, the "burden is upon the challenging party to negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification." <i>Ante, </i>at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). Or as Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, put the matter many years ago, "\'if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="383">383</a></p><p>would sustain\'" challenged legislation, then "\'there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing ... that the action is arbitrary.\'" <i>Pacific States Box </i>&amp; Basket Co. v. <i>White, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/176/case.html">296 U.

Imposing this special "burden" upon Congress, the Court fails to find in the legislative record sufficient indication that Congress has "negative[d]" the presumption that state action is rationally related to a legitimate objective. <i>Ante, </i>at 367.</p><p>The problem with the Court\'s approach is that neither the "burden of proof" that favors States nor any other rule of restraint applicable to <i>judges </i>applies to <i>Congress </i>when it exercises its \xc2\xa7 5 power.

We emphasized that "courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices." 473 U.

Our invocation of judicial deference and respect for Congress was based on the fact that "[\xc2\xa7]5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment empowers <i>Congress </i>to enforce [the equal protection] mandate." <i>Id., </i>at 439 (emphasis added). Indeed, we made clear that the absence of a contrary congressional finding was critical to our decision to apply mere rational-basis review to disability discrimination claims-a "congressional direction" to apply a more stringent standard would have been "controlling." <i>Ibid. </i>See also <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Davis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U.

Cf. <i>Cleburne, supra, </i>at 442-443 (addressing the problems of the "large and diversified group" of persons with disabilities "is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary"). Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification. Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have firsthand experience with discrimination and related issues.</p><p>Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.</p><p>When the Court has applied the majority\'s burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, i. <i>e., </i>the courts, do not" \'sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.\'\'\' <i>Heller, </i>509 U.

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate. Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment. And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justification-shorn of their judicialrestraint-related presumptions-that this Court recognized in <i>Cleburne.</i></p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>The Court argues in the alternative that the statute\'s damages remedy is not "congruent" with and "proportional" to the equal protection problem that Congress found. <i>Ante, </i>at 374 (citing <i>City of Boerne </i>v. <i>Flores, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/case.html">521 U.
