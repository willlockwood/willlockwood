Courts thus should not unravel state limitations rules unless their full application would defeat the goals of the federal statute at issue.  <em>See, e.g., Wilson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#269">471 U.

Tomanio, supra,</em> to review a contention that a \xc2\xa7 1983 action was barred by New York\'s 3-year limitations statute.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals had rejected the defense by relying on a "federal tolling rule" not contained among the tolling provisions the state legislature had codified with its limitations periods.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/478/case.html#482">446 U.

Limitations periods in \xc2\xa7 1983 suits are to be determined by reference to the appropriate "state statute of limitations and the coordinate tolling rules"; New York\'s legislative choices in this regard were therefore "binding rules of law."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/478/case.html#484">446 U.

Garcia, supra.</em>  Since 1846, however, the Michigan Legislature has enacted provisions tolling the onset of limitations periods for prisoners and others suffering from legal disabilities. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The contemporary counterpart provides:</p>\n<p>"[I]f the person first entitled to make an entry or bring an action is under 18 years of age, insane, or imprisoned at the time the claim accrues, the person or those claiming under the person shall have 1 year after the disability is removed through death or otherwise, to make the entry or bring the action although the period of limitations has run."</p>\n<p>Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7 600.5851(1) (1987).

A legislative committee recognized:</p>\n<p>"\'[E]ven prisoners can bring civil actions, though they may not be allowed to be personally present, so it is not as necessary to provide long periods after the removal of the disability in which to sue as it was in the past when these disabilities were considerably more real.  Nevertheless, it was considered better to allow a short period after the termination of the disability in which the person under the disability could bring an action.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Hawkins v. Justin,</em> 109 Mich. App. 743, 748, 311 N.W.2d 465, 467 (1981) (per curiam), quoting committee comment following Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7 600.5851, p. 914 (1968).  Likewise, 1986 amendments to the provision did not affect its applicability to prison inmates.  <em>See</em> historical note following Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7 600.5851, p. 540 (1987).</p>\n<p>In <em>Hawkins v. Justin, supra,</em> the Michigan Court of Appeals employed \xc2\xa7 600.5851 to toll a state law libel action by a plaintiff who was incarcerated in a state correctional institution.  "[T]he purpose of the statute is to provide prisoners with additional time to assert their legal rights," the state court concluded, "and this purpose could reasonably be based upon the fact that prisoners have restricted access to the judicial system due to their confinement."  <em>Id.</em> at 748-749, 311 N.W.2d at 467. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 490 U. S. 542</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit nonetheless refused to apply the tolling provision to inmates\' \xc2\xa7 1983 suits in this case and in <em>Higley v. Michigan Department of Corrections,</em> 835 F.2d 623 (1987).  Although it recognized in <em>Higley</em> that it was "obligated to apply state tolling statutes to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions, as long as the result is not inconsistent with federal law or policy," <em>id.</em> at 624, the court held</p>\n<p>"that application of a lengthy tolling period is clearly counterproductive to sound federal policy in attempting to deal with \xc2\xa7 1983 claims as promptly as practicable,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 626-627. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Tolling is neither inconsistent with nor required by \xc2\xa7 1983\'s goal of compensating persons whose constitutional rights have been violated, the court stated.  Its result thus turned on two other interests, which it discussed in tandem:  the settled \xc2\xa7 1983 policy of deterring officials\' unconstitutional behavior and a novel "rehabilitative function [of] providing a <em>safety valve\' for prisoner grievances." [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 626.  Concluding that quick disposition </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 490 U. S. 543</a></em></p><p><em> of \xc2\xa7 1983 suits advances these latter policies, the court held that Michigan\'s tolling law is inconsistent with federal law and declined to apply it.\n</em></p>\n<p>We do not agree with the Court of Appeals.  A State\'s decision to toll the statute of limitations during the inmate\'s disability does not frustrate \xc2\xa7 1983\'s compensation goal.  Rather, it enhances the inmate\'s ability to bring suit and recover damages for injuries. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Nor does the State\'s decision to toll its statute of limitations hinder \xc2\xa7 1983\'s deterrence interest.  In the event an official\'s misconduct is ongoing, the plaintiff will have an interest in enjoining it; thus, the time during which the official will unknowingly violate the Constitution may well be short.  The State also may have decided that, if the official knows an act is unconstitutional, the risk that he or she might be haled into court indefinitely is more likely to check misbehavior than the knowledge that he or she might escape a challenge to that conduct within a brief period of time.  The Court of Appeals may have overlooked this point in <em>Higley</em> because of its unfortunate intermeshing of \xc2\xa7 1983\'s deterrence function with a dubious "rehabilitative function." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 490 U. S. 544</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As the Sixth Circuit pointed out, <em>ibid.,</em> many prisoners are willing and able to file \xc2\xa7 1983 suits while in custody.  Thus, a State reasonably could decide that there is no need to enact a tolling statute applicable to such suits.  Alternatively, a State reasonably might conclude that some inmates may be loathe to bring suit against adversaries to whose daily supervision and control they remain subject, or that inmates who do file may not have a fair opportunity to establish the validity of their allegations while they are confined.  The Michigan tolling statute reflects a legislative decision to lessen any such difficulties by extending the time in which prisoners may seek recovery for constitutional injuries.  Such a statute is consistent with \xc2\xa7 1983\'s remedial purpose. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that petitioner had never received a hearing on his detention, even though an administrative regulation provided:</p>\n<p>"\'A resident shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing . . . before being classified to administrative segergation [<em>sic</em>]; however, a resident may be temporarily held in segregation status pending a hearing upon order of the institution head, or at the residents\' [<em>sic</em>] request.

Acts, No. 236, \xc2\xa7 5851 (effective Jan. 1, 1963).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>There is, of course, a federal interest in disposing of all litigation in the federal courts as expeditiously as possible.  But the interest in prompt resolution of disputes is vindicated by all statutes of limitations, and always must be balanced against the countervailing interest in allowing valid claims to be determined on their merits.  Although there is no reason why Congress could not strike that balance in \xc2\xa7 1983 cases by enacting a federal statute of limitations, it has not done so.  Rather, at least since 1914, <em>see O\'sullivan v. Felix,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/318/case.html">233 U. S. 318</a></span>, it has tacitly approved of the practice of relying on state legislatures to balance these conflicting interests.  Thus, the interest in prompt adjudication cannot properly be characterized as a separate interest that is "inconsistent" with Michigan\'s tolling provision; rather, it is one of the interests that Michigan has weighed in arriving at the limitations policy that federal courts must borrow.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals derived this function from the following commentary by a District Court:</p>\n<p>"We cannot help but believe that, in order to effect the rehabilitative purpose described above, as well as to deter prison officials from misconduct, quick resolution of disputes is vital.  Promptness is even more important, we think, when a prisoner is complaining that his current incarcerators are violating, or have violated, his civil rights.  To allow a prisoner one year after his release to bring his section 1983 suit neither would effect deterrence as to the alleged offender, nor rehabilitation as to the alleged victim.  Thus, so long as the state system erects no barriers to the federal courts, we regard application of the state disability tolling statute to be \'inconsistent\' with federal law."</p>\n<p><em>Vargas v. Jago,</em> 636 F.Supp. 425, 429 (SD Ohio 1986), quoted in <em>Higley v.

The passage of time -- during which memories may dim, witnesses depart, and evidence disappear -- is not necessarily an advantage to the plaintiff.  For it is the plaintiff who shoulders the burden of proof, and there is a vast difference between preserving the right to file a complaint and convincing a trier of fact that the complaint\'s allegations are true.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The notion that there is a <em>federal</em> "rehabilitative" interest in having unmeritorious claims brought to the attention of federal judges simply as a means of reducing tension within the prison is meritless.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Wilson v.

Respondents contend that these interests weigh against application of Michigan\'s tolling provision.  Brief for Respondent 22-27.  We disagree.  Those interests are more pertinent to determining which state laws are appropriate than whether application of those laws fosters the policies of \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Cf.
