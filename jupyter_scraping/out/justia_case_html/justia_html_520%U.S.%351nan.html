Petitioners are Minnesota election officials. In April 1994, Minnesota State Representative Andy Dawkins was running unopposed in the Minnesota DemocraticFarmer-Labor Party\'s (DFL) primary.2 That same month, New Party members chose Dawkins as their candidate for the same office in the November 1994 general election. Neither Dawkins nor the DFL objected, and Dawkins signed the required affidavit of candidacy for the New Party. Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7 204B.06 (1994). Minnesota, however, prohibits fusion candidacies.3 Because Dawkins had already filed as a candidate for the DFUs nomination, local election officials refused to accept the New Party\'s nominating petition.4</p><p>fusion Laws, 85 Am.

The District Court granted summary judgment for the state defendants, concluding that Minnesota\'s fusion ban was "a valid and non-discriminatory regulation of the election process," and noting that "issues concerning the mechanics of choosing candidates ... are, in large part, matters of policy best left to the deliberative bodies themselves." <i>Twin Cities Area New Party </i>v. <i>McKenna, 863</i></p><p>The Court of Appeals reversed. <i>Twin Cities Area New Party </i>v. <i>McKenna, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/73/196/">73 F.3d 196</a>, 198 (CA8 1996). First, the court determined that Minnesota\'s fusion ban "unquestionably" and "severe[ly]" burdened the New Party\'s "freedom to select a standard bearer who best represents the party\'s ideologies and preferences" and its right to "broaden the base of public participation in and support for [its] activities." <i>Ibid. </i>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The court then decided that Minnesota\'s absolute ban on multiple-party nominations was "broader than necessary to serve the State\'s asserted interests" in avoiding intraparty discord and party splintering, maintaining a stable political system, and avoiding voter confusion, and that the State\'s remaining concerns about multiple-party nomination were "simply unjustified in this case." <i>Id., </i>at 199-200. The court noted, however, that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had upheld Wisconsin\'s similar fusion ban in <i>Swamp </i>v. <i>Kennedy, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/950/383/">950 F.2d 383</a>, 386 (1991) (fusion ban did not burden associational rights and, even if it did, the State\'s interests justified the burden), cert. denied, 505 U. S. 1204 (1992). Nonetheless, the court concluded that Minnesota\'s fusion-ban provisions, Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 204B.06, subd. l(b), and</p><p>number of voters in the preceding state or county general election, whichever is less. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 204B.03, 204B.07-204B.08.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="356">356</a></p><p>204B.04, subd. 2 (1994), were unconstitutional because they severely burdened the New Party\'s associational rights and were not narrowly tailored to advance Minnesota\'s valid interests. We granted certiorari, 517 U. S. 1219 (1996), and now reverse.</p><p>Fusion was a regular feature of Gilded Age American politics. Particularly in the West and Midwest, candidates of issue-oriented parties like the Grangers, Independents, Greenbackers, and Populists often succeeded through fusion with the Democrats, and vice versa. Republicans, for their part, sometimes arranged fusion candidacies in the South, as part of a general strategy of encouraging and exploiting divisions within the dominant Democratic Party. See generally Argersinger, "A Place on the Ballot": Fusion Politics and Antifusion Laws, 85 Am. Hist. Rev. 287, 288-290 (1980).</p><p>Fusion was common in part because political parties, rather than local or state governments, printed and distributed their own ballots. These ballots contained only the names of a particular party\'s candidates, and so a voter could drop his party\'s ticket in the ballot box without even knowing that his party\'s candidates were supported by other parties as well. But after the 1888 presidential election, which was widely regarded as having been plagued by fraud, many States moved to the "Australian ballot system." Under that system, an official ballot, containing the names of all the candidates legally nominated by all the parties, was printed at public expense and distributed by public officials at polling places. <i>Id., </i>at 290-292; <i>Burdick </i>v. <i>Takushi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/428/case.html">504 U. S. 428</a>, 446-447 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (States\' move to the Australian ballot system was a "progressive reform to reduce fraudulent election practices"). By 1896, use of the Australian ballot was widespread. During the same period, many States enacted other election-related reforms, including bans on fusion candidacies.

Minnesota banned fusion in 1901.5 This trend has continued and, in this century, fusion has become the exception, not the rule. Today, multiple-party candidacies are permitted in just a few States,6 and fusion plays a significant role only in N ew York. 7</p><p>The First Amendment protects the right of citizens to associate and to form political parties for the advancement of common political goals and ideas. <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. </i>v. <i>Federal Election Comm\'n, 518 </i>U.

That is, the New Party, and not someone else, has the right to select the New Party\'s "standard bearer." It does not follow, though, that a party is absolutely entitled to have its nominee appear on the ballot as that party\'s candidate. A particular candidate might be ineligible for office,s unwilling to serve, or, as here, another party\'s candidate. That a particular individual may not appear on the ballot as a particular party\'s candidate does not severely burden that party\'s associational rights. See <i>Burdick, </i>504 U.

And in <i>Tashjian, </i>we held that Connecticut\'s closed-primary statute, which required voters in a party primary to be registered party members, interfered with a party\'s associational rights by limiting "the group of registered voters whom the Party may invite to participate in the basic function of selecting the Party\'s candidates." 479 U. S., at 215-216 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). But while <i>Tashjian </i>and <i>Eu </i>involved regulation of political parties\' internal affairs and core associational activities, Minnesota\'s fusion ban does not. The ban, which applies to major and minor parties alike, simply precludes one party\'s candidate from appearing on the ballot, as that party\'s candidate, if already nominated by another party. Respondent is free to try to convince Representative Dawkins to be the New Party\'s, not the DFL\'s, candidate. See <i>Swamp, </i>950 F. 2d, at 385 ("[A] party may nominate any candidate that the party can convince to be <i>its </i>candidate"). Whether the party still wants to endorse a candidate who, because of the fusion ban, will not appear on the ballot as the party\'s candidate, is up to the party.</p><p>The Court of Appeals also held that Minnesota\'s laws "keep the New Party from developing consensual political alliances and thus broadening the base of public participation in and support for its activities." <i>McKenna, </i>73 F. 3d, at 199. The burden on the party was, the court held, severe because "[h]istory shows that minor parties have played a significant role in the electoral system where multiple party nomination is legal, but have no meaningful influence where multiple party nomination is banned." <i>Ibid. </i>In the view of the Court of Appeals, Minnesota\'s fusion ban forces members of the New Party to make a "no-win choice" between voting for "candidates with no realistic chance of winning, defect[ing] from their party and vot[ing] for a major party candidate who does, or declin[ing] to vote at all." <i>Ibid.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="361">361</a></p><p>But Minnesota has not directly precluded minor political parties from developing and organizing.

This is a predictive judgment which is by no means self-evident.9</p><p>9 Between the First and Second World Wars, for example, various radical, agrarian, and labor-oriented parties thrived, without fusion, in the Midwest. See generally R. Valelly, Radicalism in the States (1989). One of these parties, Minnesota\'s Farmer-Labor Party, displaced the Democratic Party as the Republicans\' primary opponent in Minnesota during the 1930\'s. As one historian has noted: "The Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party elected its candidates to the governorship on four occasions, to the U. S. Senate in five elections, and to the U. S. House in twenty-five campaigns .... Never less than Minnesota\'s second strongest party, in 1936 Farmer-Laborites dominated state politics .... The Farmer-Labor Party was a success despite its independence of America\'s two dominant national parties and despite the sometimes bold anticapitalist rhetoric of its platforms." J. Haynes, Dubious Alliance 9 (1984). It appears that factionalism within the Farmer- Labor Party, the popular successes of New Deal programs and ideology, and the gradual movement of political power from the States to the National Government contributed to the party\'s de-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="362">362</a></p><p>But, more importantly, the supposed benefits of fusion to minor parties do not require that Minnesota permit it. See <i>Tashjian, supra, </i>at 222 (refusing to weigh merits of closed and open primaries). Many features of our political sys<i>tem-e. </i><i>g., </i>single-member districts, "first past the post" elections, and the high costs of campaigning-make it difficult for third parties to succeed in American politics. Burnham Declaration, App. 12-13. But the Constitution does not require States to permit fusion any more than it requires them to move to proportional-representation elections or public financing of campaigns. See <i>Mobile </i>v. <i>Bolden, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html">446 U.

Brief for Respondent 22-23.</p><p>It is true that Minnesota\'s fusion ban prevents the New Party from using the ballot to communicate to the public that it supports a particular candidate who is already another party\'s candidate. In addition, the ban shuts off one possible avenue a party might use to send a message to its preferred <i>candidate </i>because, with fusion, a candidate who wins an election on the basis of two parties\' votes will likely know more-if the parties\' votes are counted separately-about the particular wishes and ideals of his constituency.

Ballots serve primarily to elect candidates, not as forums for political expression. See <i>Burdick, </i>504 U. S., at 438; <i>id., </i>at 445 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Like all parties in Minnesota, the New Party is able to use the ballot to communicate information about itself and its candidate to the voters, so long as that candidate is not already someone else\'s candidate. The party retains great latitude in its ability to communicate ideas to voters and candidates through its participation in the campaign, and party members may campaign for, endorse, and vote for their preferred candidate even if he is listed on the ballot as another party\'s candidate. See <i>Anderson, </i>460 U.

The laws do not directly limit the party\'s access to the ballot. They are silent on parties\' internal structure, governance, and policymaking. Instead, these provisions reduce the universe of potential candidates who may appear on the ballot as the party\'s nominee only by ruling out those few individuals who both have already agreed to be another party\'s candidate and also, if forced to choose, themselves prefer that other party. They also limit, slightly, the party\'s ability to send a message to the voters and to its preferred candidates. We conclude that the burdens Minnesota imposes on the party\'s First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights-though not trivial-are not severe.</p><p>The Court of Appeals determined that Minnesota\'s fusion ban imposed "severe" burdens on the New Party\'s associa-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="364">364</a></p><p>tional rights, and so it required the State to show that the ban was narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. <i>McKenna, </i>73 F. 3d, at 198. We disagree; given the burdens imposed, the bar is not so high. Instead, the State\'s asserted regulatory interests need only be "sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation" imposed on the party\'s rights. <i>Norman, </i>502 U.

Minnesota argues here that its fusion ban is justified by its interests in avoiding voter confusion, promoting candidate competition (by reserving limited ballot space for opposing candidates), preventing electoral distortions and ballot manipulations, and discouraging party splintering and "unrestrained factionalism." Brief for Petitioners 41-50.</p><p>States certainly have an interest in protecting the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of their ballots and election processes as means for electing public officials. <i>Bullock, 405 </i>U.

For example, members of a major party could decide that a powerful way of "sending a message" via the ballot would be for various factions of that party to nominate the major party\'s candidate as the candidate for the newly formed "No New Taxes," "Conserve Our Environment," and "Stop Crime Now" parties. In response, an opposing major party would likely instruct its factions to nominate that party\'s candidate as the "Fiscal Responsibility," "Healthy Planet," and "Safe Streets" parties\' candidate.</p><p>Whether or not the putative "fusion" candidates\' names appeared on one or four ballot lines, such maneuvering would undermine the ballot\'s purpose by transforming it from a means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising. The New Party responds to this concern, ironically enough, by insisting that the State could avoid such manipulation by adopting more demanding ballot-access standards rather than prohibiting multiple-party nomination. Brief for Respondent 38. However, as we stated above, because the burdens the fusion ban imposes on the party\'s associational rights are not severe, the State need not narrowly tailor the means it chooses to promote ballot integrity. The Constitution does not require that Minnesota compromise the policy choices embodied in its ballot-access requirements to accommodate the New Party\'s fusion strategy. See Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7 204B.08, subd. 3 (1994) (signature requirements for nominating petitions); <i>Rosario, supra, </i>at 761-762 (New York\'s time limitation for enrollment in a political party was part of an overall scheme aimed at the preservation of the integrity of the State\'s electoral process).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="366">366</a></p><p>Relatedly, petitioners urge that permitting fusion would undercut Minnesota\'s ballot-access regime by allowing minor parties to capitalize on the popularity of another party\'s candidate, rather than on their own appeal to the voters, in order to secure access to the ballot. Brief for Petitioners 45-46. That is, voters who might not sign a minor party\'s nominating petition based on the party\'s own views and candidates might do so if they viewed the minor party as just another way of nominating the same person nominated by one of the major parties. Thus, Minnesota fears that fusion would enable minor parties, by nominating a major party\'s candidate, to bootstrap their way to major-party status in the next election and circumvent the State\'s nominatingpetition requirement for minor parties. See Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 200.02, subd. 7 (defining "major party"), and 204D.13 (1994) (describing ballot order for major and other parties). The State surely has a valid interest in making sure that minor and third parties who are granted access to the ballot are bona fide and actually supported, on their own merits, by those who have provided the statutorily required petition or ballot support. <i>Anderson, </i>460 U.

California\'s experiment with cross-filing, on the other hand, provides some justification for Minnesota\'s concerns. In 1946, for example, Earl Warren was the nominee of both major parties, and was therefore able to run unopposed in California\'s general election. It appears to be widely accepted that California\'s cross-filing system stifled electoral competition and undermined the role of distinctive political parties. See B. Hyink, S. Brown, &amp; D. Provost, Politics and Government in California 76 (12th ed. 1989) (California\'s cross-filing law "undermined party responsibility and cohesiveness"); D.

By reading <i>Storer </i>as dealing only with "sore-loser candidates," JUSTICE STEVENS, in our view, fails to appreciate the case\'s teaching. <i>Post, </i>at 377 (dissenting opinion). Under the California disaffiliation statute at issue in <i>Storer, any </i>person affiliated with a party at any time during the year leading up to the primary election was absolutely precluded from appearing on the ballot as an independent or as the candidate of another party. Minnesota\'s fusion ban is not nearly so restrictive; the challenged provisions say nothing about the previous party affiliation of would-be candidates but only require that, in order to appear on the ballot, a candidate not be the nominee of more than one party. California\'s disaffiliation rule limited the field of candidates by thousands; Minnesota\'s precludes only a handful who freely choose to be so limited. It is also worth noting that while California\'s disaffiliation statute absolutely banned many candidacies, Minnesota\'s fusion ban only prohibits a candidate from being named twice.</p><p>We conclude that the burdens Minnesota\'s fusion ban imposes on the New Party\'s associational rights are justified by "correspondingly weighty" valid state interests in ballot</p><p>work[ed] against the efforts of minority factions to gain recognition and a hearing in the electoral arena").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="370">370</a></p><p>integrity and political stability.13 In deciding that Minnesota\'s fusion ban does not unconstitutionally burden the New Party\'s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, we express no views on the New Party\'s policy-based arguments concerning the wisdom of fusion. It may well be that, as support for new political parties increases, these arguments will carry the day in some States\' legislatures.

A fusion ban burdens the right of a minor party to broaden its base of support because of the political reality that the dominance of the major parties frequently makes a vote for a minor party or independent candidate a "wasted" vote. When minor parties can nominate a candidate also nominated by a major party, they are able to present their members with an opportunity to cast a vote for a candidate who will actually be elected. Although this aspect of a party\'s effort to broaden support is distinct from the ability to nominate the candidate who best represents the party\'s views, it is important to note that the party\'s right to broaden the base of its support is burdened in both ways by the fusion ban.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="373">373</a></p><p>the ballot altogether, and publicly endorse the candidate of another party. But the right to be on the election ballot is precisely what separates a political party from any other interest group.2 The Court relies on the fact that the Party remains free "to spread its message to all who will listen," <i>ante, </i>at 361, through forums other than the ballot. Given the limited resources available to most minor parties, and the less-than-universal interest in the messages of third parties, it is apparent that the Party\'s message will, in this manner, reach a much smaller audience than that composed of all voters who can read the ballot in the polling booth.</p><p>The majority rejects as unimportant the limits that the fusion ban may impose on the Party\'s ability to express its political views, <i>ante, </i>at 362-363, relying on our decision in <i>Burdick </i>v. <i>Takushi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/428/case.html">504 U. S. 428</a>, 445 (1992), in which we noted that "the purpose of casting, counting, and recording votes is to elect public officials, not to serve as a general forum for political expression." But in <i>Burdick </i>we concluded simply that an individual voter\'s interest in expressing his disapproval of the single candidate running for office in a particular election did not require the State to finance and provide a mechanism for tabulating write-in votes. Our conclusion that the ballot is not principally a forum for the individual expression of political sentiment through the casting of a vote does not justify the conclusion that the ballot serves no expressive purpose for the parties who place candidates on the ballot. Indeed, the long-recognized right to choose a "\'standard bearer who best represents the party\'s ideologies and preferences,\'" <i>Eu, </i>489 U. S., at 224, is inescapably an expressive right. "To the extent that party labels</p><p>2We have recognized that "[t]here is no evidence that an endorsement issued by an official party organization carries more weight than one issued by a newspaper or a labor union." <i>Eu </i>v. <i>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/214/case.html">489 U.

Popular candidates like Andy Dawkins sometimes receive nationwide recognition. Fiorello LaGuardia, Earl Warren, Ronald Reagan, and Franklin D. Roosevelt are names that come readily to mind as candidates whose reputations and political careers were enhanced because they appeared on election ballots as fusion candidates. See Note, Fusion and the Associational Rights of Minor Political Parties, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 683 (1995). A statute that denied a political party the right to nominate any of those individuals for high office simply because he had already been nominated by another party would, in my opinion, place an intolerable burden on political expression and association.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Minnesota argues that the statutory restriction on the Party\'s right to nominate the candidate of its choice is justified by the State\'s interests in avoiding voter confusion, preventing ballot clutter and manipulation, encouraging candidate competition, and minimizing intraparty factionalism. None of these rationales can support the fusion ban because the State has failed to explain how the ban actually serves the asserted interests.</p><p>I believe that the law significantly abridges First Amendment freedoms and that the State therefore must shoulder a correspondingly heavy burden of justification if the law is to survive judicial scrutiny.

See <i>Anderson, </i>460 U. S., at 789. Although the Court today suggests that the State does not have to support its asserted justifications for the fusion ban with evidence that they have any empirical validity, <i>ante, </i>at 364, we have previously required more than a bare assertion that some particular state interest is served by a burdensome election requirement. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Eu, </i>489 U. S., at 226 (rejecting California\'s argument that the State\'s endorsement ban protected political stability because the State "never adequately explain[ed] how banning parties from endorsing or opposing primary candidates advances that interest"); <i>Anderson, </i>460 U.

See Brief for Conservative Party of New York et al. as <i>Amici Curiae 20-25. </i>Thus, the evidence that actually is available diminishes, rather than strengthens, Minnesota\'s claims. The majority asserts, <i>ante, </i>at 368-369, n. 12, that California\'s cross-filing system, in place during the first half of this century, provides a compelling counterexample. But cross-filing, which "allowed candidates to file in the primary of any or all parties without specifying party affiliation," D. Mazmanian, Third Parties in Presidential Elections 132-133 (1974) (hereinafter Mazmanian), is simply not the same as fusion politics, and the problems suffered in California do not provide empirical support for Minnesota\'s position.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="376">376</a></p><p>typical voter.4 We have noted more than once that "[a] State\'s claim that it is enhancing the ability of its citizenry to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed with some skepticism." <i>Eu, 489 </i>U.

The possibility that members of the major parties will begin to create dozens of minor parties with detailed, issue-oriented titles for the sole purpose of nominating candidates under those titles, see <i>ante, </i>at 365, is entirely hypothetical. The majority dismisses out-of-hand the Party\'s argument that the risk of this type of ballot manipulation and crowding is more easily averted by maintaining reasonably stringent requirements for the creation of minor parties. <i>Ibid. </i>In fact, though, the Party\'s point merely illustrates the idea that a State can place some kinds-but not every kind-of limitation on the abilities of small parties to thrive. If the State wants to make it more difficult for any group to achieve the legal status of being a political party, it can do so within reason and still not run up against the First Amendment. "The State has the undoubted right to require candidates to make a preliminary showing of substantial support in order to qualify for a place on the ballot, because it is both wasteful and confusing to encumber the ballot with the names of frivolous candidates." <i>Anderson, </i>460 U. S., at 788-789, n. 9. See also <i>Jenness </i>v. <i>Fortson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html">403 U. S. 431</a>, 442 (1971).

States do certainly have an interest in maintaining a stable political system. <i>Eu, </i>489 U. S., at 226. But the State has not convincingly articulated how the fusion ban will prevent the factionalism it fears. Unlike the law at issue in <i>Storer </i>v. <i>Brown, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html">415 U. S. 724</a> (1974), for example, this law would not prevent sore-loser candidates from defecting with a disaffected segment of a major party and running as an opposition candidate for a newly formed minor party. Nor does this law, like those aimed at requiring parties to show a modicum of support in order to secure a place on the election ballot, prevent the formation of numerous small parties. Indeed, the activity banned by Minnesota\'s law is the formation of coalitions, not the division and dissension of "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism." <i>Id., </i>at 736.</p><p>As for the State\'s argument that the fusion ban encourages candidate competition, this claim treats "candidates" as fungible goods, ignoring entirely each party\'s interest in nominating not just any candidate, but the candidate who best represents the party\'s views.

I turn, therefore, to what appears to be the true basis for the Court\'s holding-the interest in preserving the two-party system.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Before addressing the merits of preserving the two-party system as a justification for Minnesota\'s fusion ban, I should note that, in my view, it is impermissible for the Court to consider this rationale.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. Our opinions have been explicit in their willingness to consider only the particular interests put forward by a State to support laws that impose any sort of burden on First Amendment rights. See <i>Anderson, 460 </i>U. S., at 789 (the Court will "identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule"); <i>id., </i>at 817 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (state laws that burden First Amendment rights are upheld when they are "\'tied to a particularized legitimate purpose\'\'\') (quoting <i>Rosario </i>v. <i>Rockefeller, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/752/case.html">410 U. S. 752</a>, 762 (1973)); <i>Burdick, </i>504 U. S., at 434.</p><p>Even if the State had put forward this interest to support its laws, it would not be sufficient to justify the fusion ban. In most States, perhaps in all, there are two and only two major political parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that most States have enacted election laws that impose burdens on the development and growth of third parties. The law at issue in this case is undeniably such a law. The fact that the law was both intended to disadvantage minor parties and has had that effect is a matter that should weigh against, rather than in favor of, its constitutionality.6</p><p>6 Indeed, "[a] burden that falls unequally on new or small political parties or on independent candidates impinges, by its very nature, on associational choices protected by the First Amendment." <i>Anderson </i>v. <i>Celebrezze, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/780/case.html">460 U. S. 780</a>, 793-794 (1983). I do not think it is irrelevant that when antifusion laws were passed by States all over the Nation in the latter part of the 1800\'s, these laws, characterized by the majority as "reforms," <i>ante, </i>at 356, were passed by "the parties in power in state legislatures ... to squelch the threat posed by the opposition\'s combined voting force." <i>McKenna, </i>73 F. 3d, at 198. See Argersinger, "A Place on the Ballot"; Fusion Politics and Antifusion Laws, 85 Am. Rist. Rev. 287, 302-306 (1980). Although the State is not required now to justify its laws with exclusive reference to the original purpose behind their passage,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="379">379</a></p><p>Our jurisprudence in this area reflects a certain tension:</p><p>On the one hand, we have been clear that political stability is an important state interest and that incidental burdens on the formation of minor parties are reasonable to protect that interest, see <i>Storer, </i>415 U. S., at 736; on the other, we have struck down state elections laws specifically because they give "the two old, established parties a decided advantage over any new parties struggling for existence," <i>Williams </i>v. <i>Rhodes, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html">393 U. S. 23</a>,31 (1968).7 Between these boundaries, we have acknowledged that there is "no litmus-paper test for separating those restrictions that are valid from those that are invidious .... The rule is not self-executing and is no substitute for the hard judgments that must be made." <i>Storer, </i>415 U. S., at 730.</p><p>Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the States from maintaining single-member districts with winner-take-all voting arrangements. And these elements of an election system do make it significantly more difficult for third parties to thrive. But these laws are different in two respects from the fusion bans at issue here. First, the method by which they hamper third-party development is not one that impinges on the associational rights of those third parties; minor parties remain free to nominate candidates of their choice, and to rally support for those candidates. The small parties\' relatively limited likelihood of ultimate success on election day does not deprive them of the right to try. Second, the establishment of single-member districts correlates</p><p><i>Bolger </i>v. <i>Youngs Drug Products Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/60/case.html">463 U. S. 60</a>, 70-71 (1983), this history does provide some indication of the kind of burden the States themselves believed they were imposing on the smaller parties\' effective association.</p><p>7 In <i>Anderson, </i>the State argued that its interest in political stability justified the early filing deadline for Presidential candidates at issue in the case. We recognized that the "asserted interest in political stability amounts to a desire to protect existing political parties from competition," and rejected that interest. 460 U.

Systems of proportional representation, for example, may tend toward factionalism and fragile coalitions that diminish legislative effectiveness. In the context of fusion candidacies, the risks to political stability are extremely attenuated.8 Of course, the reason minor parties so ardently support fusion politics is because it allows the parties to build up a greater base of support, as potential minor party members realize that a vote for the smaller party candidate is not necessarily a "wasted" vote. Eventually, a minor party might gather sufficient strength that-were its members so inclined-it could successfully run a candidate not endorsed by any major party, and legislative coalition building will be made more difficult by the presence of third-party legislators. But the risks to political stability in that scenario are speculative at best.9</p><p>In some respects, the fusion candidacy is the best marriage of the virtues of the minor party challenge to entrenched viewpoints 10 and the political stability that the two-party</p><p>8 Even in a system that allows fusion, a candidate for election must assemble majority support, so the State\'s concern cannot logically be about risks to political stability in the particular election in which the fusion candidate is running.</p><p>9 In fact, Minnesota\'s expressed concern that fusion candidacies would stifle political diversity because minor parties would not put additional names on the ballot seems directly contradictory to the majority\'s imposed interest in the stable two-party system. The tension between the Court\'s rationale for its decision and the State\'s actually articulated interests is one of the reasons I do not believe the Court can legitimately consider interests not relied on by the State, especially in a context where the burden imposed and the interest justifying it must have some relationship.</p><p>10 "[A]s an outlet for frustration, often as a creative force and a sort of conscience, as an ideological governor to keep major parties from speeding off into an abyss of mindlessness, and even just as a technique for strengthening a group\'s bargaining position for the future, the minor party would have to be invented if it did not come into existence regularly enough."

The fusion candidacy does not threaten to divide the legislature and create significant risks of factionalism, which is the principal risk proponents of the two-party system point to. But it does provide a means by which voters with viewpoints not adequately represented by the platforms of the two major parties can indicate to a particular candidate that-in addition to his support for the major party views-he should be responsive to the views of the minor party whose support for him was demonstrated where political parties demonstrate support-on the ballot.</p><p>The strength of the two-party system-and of each of its major components-is the product of the power of the ideas, the traditions, the candidates, and the voters that constitute the parties.ll It demeans the strength of the two-party system to assume that the major parties need to rely on laws that discriminate against independent voters and minor parties in order to preserve their positions of power.12 Indeed,</p><p>S.

I also agree with JUSTICE STEVENS\'S view, set out in the first paragraph of Part III, that the State does not assert the interest in preserving "the traditional two-party system" upon which the majority repeatedly relies in upholding Minnesota\'s statutes, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>ante, </i>at 367 ("The Constitution permits the Minnesota Legislature to decide that political stability is best served through a healthy two-party system"). Actually, Minnesota\'s statement of the "important regulatory concerns advanced by the State\'s ban on ballot fusion," Brief for Petitioners 40, contains no reference whatsoever to the "twoparty system," nor even any explicit reference to "political stability" generally. See <i>id., </i>at 40-50.</p><p>To be sure, the State does assert its intention to prevent "party splintering," <i>id., </i>at 46-50, which may not be separable in the abstract from a desire to preserve political stabil-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="383">383</a></p><p>ity.l But in fact the State has less comprehensive concerns; the primary dangers posed by what it calls "major-party splintering and factionalism," <i>id., </i>at 47, are said to be those of "turn[ing] the general election ballot into a forum for venting intraparty squabbles," <i>ibid., </i>and reducing elections to "a thinly disguised ballot-issue campaign," <i>id., </i>at 49. Nowhere does the State even intimate that the splintering it wishes to avert might cause or hasten the demise of the twoparty system. In these circumstances, neither the State\'s point about "splintering," nor its tentative reference to "political stability" at oral argument, n. 1, <i>infra, </i>may fairly be assimilated to the interest posited by the Court of preserving the "two-party system." Accordingly, because I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, <i>ante, </i>at 378, that our election cases restrict our consideration to "the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule," <i>Anderson </i>v. <i>Celebrezze, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/780/case.html">460 U.

For while Minnesota has made no such argument before us, I cannot discount the possibility of a forceful one. There is considerable consensus that party loyalty among American voters has declined significantly in the past four decades, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>W.
