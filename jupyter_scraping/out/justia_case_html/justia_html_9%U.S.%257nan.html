CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>If this case depended upon the replication, the judgment of the Court must be in favor of the defendants.  It is certainly bad, inasmuch as it charges the defendants with moneys not collected.  But upon a demurrer, the judgment is to be against the party who committed the first error in pleading.</p>\n<p>The want of oyer is a fatal defect in the plea of the defendants, and the Court cannot look at any subsequent proceeding.  The plea was bad when pleaded.  The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
