MISSISSIPPI<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">MARLON LATODD HOWELL, aka MARLON COX,\nPETITIONER <em>v.</em> MISSISSIPPI</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi</p>\n<p align="left">[January 24, 2005]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Marlon Howell contends that the Mississippi courts violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by refusing to require a jury instruction about a lesser included offense in his capital case.  He did not, however, raise this claim in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which unsurprisingly did not address it.  As a result, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death for killing Hugh David Pernell.  Shortly after 5 a.m. on May 15, 2000, Pernell was delivering newspapers from his car when the occupants of another car motioned for him to stop.  The evidence at trial indicated that, when both cars had pulled over, petitioner got out of the trailing car and approached the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side of Pernell\xe2\x80\x99s car.  After a brief conversation and perhaps some kind of scuffle, petitioner pulled out a pistol, shot Pernell through the heart, got back in the other car, and fled the scene.  See 860 So.\xc2\xa02d 704, 712\xe2\x80\x93715, 738\xe2\x80\x93739 (Miss. 2003).  At trial, petitioner argued both that he was in another city at the time of the killing and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Pernell was killed during an attempted robbery (which would deprive the State of an element of capital murder).  As part of his non-alibi defense, petitioner sought to supplement the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed jury instruction on capital murder with instructions on manslaughter and simple murder.  The trial court refused the additional instructions.  The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder and separately concluded that he should be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal to the State Supreme Court, one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s 28 claims of error was the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure \xe2\x80\x9cto give the defendant an instruction on the offense of simple murder or manslaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 39.  In that argument, petitioner cited three cases from the State Supreme Court about lesser-included-offense instructions, and the only opinion whose original language he quoted was a noncapital case.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting, with modifications, <em>Conner</em> v. <em>State,</em> 632 So.\xc2\xa02d 1239, 1254 (Miss. 1993) (a capital case), in turn quoting <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>State,</em> 541 So.\xc2\xa02d 1027, 1028 (Miss. 1989) (a noncapital case), in turn quoting <em>Harper</em> v. <em>State,</em> 478 So.\xc2\xa02d 1017, 1021 (Miss. 1985) (a noncapital case)).  Petitioner argued that, because the jury \xe2\x80\x9ccould have found and returned the lesser included offense of simple murder or manslaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d the failure to give instructions on those offenses was \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d that left the jury no \xe2\x80\x9cchoice but either to turn [him] loose or convict him of [c]apital [m]urder.\xe2\x80\x9d  App.<em> </em>40.  In the course of affirming petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and death sentence, the State Supreme Court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he facts of this case clearly do not support or warrant\xe2\x80\x9d the instruction for manslaughter or simple murder.  860 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 744.  The court cited and quoted a prior noncapital decision, which construed a state statute and concluded that an instruction should be refused if it would cause the jury to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ignore the primary charge\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98if the evidence does not justify submission of a lesser-included offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Presley</em> v. <em>State,</em> 321 So.\xc2\xa02d 309, 310\xe2\x80\x93311 (Miss. 1975)).  The court also cited <em>Grace</em> v. <em>State,</em> 375 So.\xc2\xa02d 419 (Miss. 1979), an aggravated-assault case rejecting an instruction for simple assault.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner sought certiorari from this Court, arguing that his death sentence is unconstitutional under that rule of our capital jurisprudence set forth in <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/625/index.html">447 U. S. 625</a>, 638 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the State] is constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from the jury in a capital case\xe2\x80\x9d).  See Pet. for Cert. 5.  We granted certiorari, but asked the parties to address the following additional question: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Was petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional claim properly raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S. ___ (2004).  Our answer to that question prevents us from reaching petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has given this Court the power to review \xe2\x80\x9c[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had \xe2\x80\xa6 where any \xe2\x80\xa6 right \xe2\x80\xa6 is <em>specially set up or claimed</em> under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of \xe2\x80\xa6 the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257(a) (emphasis added).  Under that statute and its predecessors, this Court has almost unfailingly refused to consider any federal-law challenge to a state-court decision unless the federal claim \xe2\x80\x9cwas either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we have been asked to review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adams</em> v. <em>Robertson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/83/index.html">520 U. S. 83</a>, 86 (1997) <em>(per curiam);</em> see also <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Gates,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/index.html">462 U. S. 213</a>, 218 (1983) (tracing this principle back to <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Randell,</em> 10 Pet. 368, 391 (1836), and <em>Owings</em> v. <em>Norwood\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee,</em> 5 Cranch 344 (1809)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s brief in the State Supreme Court did not properly present his claim as one arising under federal law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the relevant argument, he did not cite the Constitution or even any cases directly construing it, much less any of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases.  Instead, he argues that he presented his federal claim by citing <em>Harveston</em> v. <em>State,</em> 493 So.\xc2\xa02d 365 (Miss. 1986), which cited (among other cases) <em>Fairchild</em> v. <em>State,</em> 459 So.\xc2\xa02d 793 (Miss. 1984), which in turn cited <em>Beck</em>, but only by way of acknowledging that Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s general rule requiring lesser-included-offense instructions \xe2\x80\x9ctakes on constitutional proportions\xe2\x80\x9d in capital cases.  459 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 800.  Assuming it constituted adequate briefing of the federal question under state-law standards, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s daisy chain\xe2\x80\x94which depends upon a case that was cited by one of the cases that was cited by one of the cases that petitioner cited\xe2\x80\x94is too lengthy to meet this Court\xe2\x80\x99s standards for proper presentation of a federal claim.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  As we recently explained in a slightly different context, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief \xe2\x80\xa6 by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \xe2\x80\x98federal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baldwin</em> v. <em>Reese,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/27/index.html">541 U. S. 27</a>, 32 (2004).  In the context of \xc2\xa71257, the same steps toward clarity are just as easy to take and are generally necessary to establish that a federal question was properly presented to a state court.  Petitioner did none of these things.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner also contends that he raised his federal claim by implication because the state-law rule on which he relied was \xe2\x80\x9cidentical,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, or \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually identical,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 17\xe2\x80\x9318, to the constitutional rule articulated in <em>Beck</em>.  Assuming, without deciding, that identical standards might overcome a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to identify his claim as federal, Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s rule regarding lesser-included-offense instructions is not identical to <em>Beck</em>\xe2\x80\x94or at least not identical to the Mississippi Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Beck</em>.  Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s rule applies even when the jury is not choosing only between acquittal and death.  The Mississippi Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Beck</em>, on the other hand, holds that case inapplicable where the jury has the additional option of life imprisonment, see <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>State,</em> 684 So.\xc2\xa02d 1213, 1228 (1996)\xe2\x80\x94a conclusion that finds some support in our cases, see <em>Hopkins</em> v. <em>Reeves, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/88/index.html">524 U. S. 88</a>, 98 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn <em>Beck,</em> the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction, and Beck\xe2\x80\x99s jury was told that if it convicted the defendant of the charged offense, it was required to impose the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Schad</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/624/index.html">501 U. S. 624</a>, 646 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur fundamental concern in <em>Beck</em> was that a jury \xe2\x80\xa6 might \xe2\x80\xa6 vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, unlike <em>Beck</em>, see 447 U. S., at 638, n.\xc2\xa014, Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s rule on lesser-included-offense instructions applies in <em>noncapital</em> cases (as shown by the cases petitioner did cite).  Thus, one opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have treated a claim under <em>Beck</em> as distinct from one arising under the Mississippi rule.  See <em>Goodin</em> v. <em>State,</em> 787 So.\xc2\xa02d 639, 656 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cHaving found no [federal] constitutional flaws in the jury instruction given, we must now determine whether our practice entitles Goodin to a manslaughter instruction.  We have held that there must be some evidentiary support to grant an instruction for manslaughter\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner suggests that we need not treat his failure to present his federal claim in state court as jurisdictional.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Notwithstanding the long line of cases clearly stating that the presentation requirement is jurisdictional, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Exxon Corp.</em> v. <em>Eagerton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/176/index.html">462 U. S. 176</a>, 181, n.\xc2\xa03 (1983); <em>Cardinale</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/437/index.html">394 U. S. 437</a>, 438\xe2\x80\x93439 (1969) (citing cases), a handful of exceptions (discussed in <em>Gates,</em> 462 U. S., at 219) have previously led us to conclude that this is \xe2\x80\x9can unsettled question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Crenshaw,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/71/index.html">486 U.

As in prior cases, however, we need not decide today \xe2\x80\x9cwhether our requirement that a federal claim be addressed or properly presented in state court is jurisdictional or prudential, because even treating the rule as purely prudential, the circumstances here justify no exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adams,</em> 520 U.
