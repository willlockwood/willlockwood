CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>The principles settled in the case of the <em>Rapid</em> decides this cause so far as respects the character of the <em>Alexander</em> and her cargo.  In open sea, unpressed by any peculiar danger, with a full knowledge of the war, she changes her course and seeks an enemy\'s port.  If such an act could be justified, it were vain to prohibit trade with the enemy.  The subsequent traffic in the enemy country, by which her return cargo was obtained, connects itself with this voluntary sailing for an enemy port; nor does the circumstance that she was carried by force into Ireland, when her actual destination was England, break the chain.  The conduct of the <em>Alexander</em> is much less to be defended than that of the <em>Rapid.</em></p>\n<p>But it is alleged by the claimants that in this case there was no actual capture.  This allegation cannot, in the opinion of the Court, be sustained.  That the <em>America</em> took possession of the <em>Alexander</em> with the intention of making prize of that part of her cargo which might be deemed British is not controverted.  How was this intention to be executed, how was this part of the cargo to be libeled, if it was not captured?  And if such part of the cargo as might eventually be British was captured and the whole remained together in the vessel, how can the capture be considered as partial?</p>\n<p>But it has been truly observed that it is not noncapture, but abandonment, for which the complainants in fact contend. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 12 U. S. 180</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But while the whole cargo remains together, claimed by the captor, if it be enemy property, how can any part of it be said to be abandoned?  If it was entirely abandoned, for what purpose was one of the crew of the <em>America</em> put on board the <em>Alexander?</em></p>\n<p>The inability of the prize master to secure the captured vessel against a rescue, should one be attempted, his inability to bring in the vessel without the aid of the hands belonging to her, is in reason no proof of abandonment.  If the circumstances of the captured vessel be such as to do away all apprehension of rescue and inspire confidence that the crew will bring her into port, no reason is perceived why the property of the captor may not be retained as well by a prize master alone as by a considerable detachment from his crew.  The cases cited to this point by the counsel for the captors are entirely satisfactory.</p>\n<p>With as little reason do the claimants seek to shelter themselves under the instructions of 28 August, 1812.  Those instructions apply in express terms to such American vessels as have sailed from Great Britain for the United States "in consequence of the alleged repeal of the British orders in council."  A vessel which sailed while those orders were not alleged to be repealed cannot bring herself within these instructions.</p>\n<p>But it is alleged that these instructions are still issued, and must mean something.  Rather than ascribe their continuance to inattention, the counsel for the claimants would give them a construction in direct hostility with their letter and spirit.  Were this reasoning even admitted to be correct, which it is not, it would become the duty of the Court to be astute in finding some object to which they might possibly apply.  It is possible, though certainly it is barely possible, that some vessels which sailed from England while the orders of council were supposed to be repealed may not yet have reached the United States.  It would be more reasonable to reserve these instructions for such possible case than to apply them to cases which can neither be brought within their words nor their meaning.</p>\n<p><em>The sentence is affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
