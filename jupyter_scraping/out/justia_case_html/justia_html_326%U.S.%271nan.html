JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This writ of certiorari brings before us the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska which affirmed a judgment of a district court dismissing a petition for habeas corpus to inquire into petitioner\'s detention for want of merit and failure to state a cause of action.  <em>Hawk v. Olson,</em> 145 Neb. 306, 16 N.W.2d 181. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Petitioner was in the penitentiary after conviction for murder.  The writ was granted because a substantial federal question as to restraint without due process of law under the Fourteenth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 326 U.

It is said that some of the grounds for release are pleaded in the form of conclusions, and that Nebraska procedure requires in habeas corpus proceedings that the applicant must set forth the facts from which it must appear that he will be entitled to discharge.  <em>Hawk v. Olson,</em> 16 N.W.2d 181, 183 l.c..  We assume, since such grounds appear in the petition, that one of these pretermitted grounds is that "[c]onviction was obtained by the use of perjured testimony knowingly used by the Prosecuting Officials and the Trial Court."  <em>See Ex parte Hawk,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/114/case.html">321 U.

On the issues of the sufficiency of the evidence and the interference with the right of appeal, we accept the decision of Nebraska that the first cannot be raised by habeas corpus (<em>Hawk v.

Missouri, supra.</em></p>\n<p>Petitioner, a layman, set out the following allegations in his petition.  On March 16, 1936 at 4:15 p.m., the petitioner, who had previously had a preliminary hearing, was brought to Omaha from the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.  He was held incommunicado in the Omaha jail except for a visit of fifteen minutes that evening, 11 to 11:15 p.m., by the Public Defender and his assistant.  These officials tried to intimidate the petitioner to plead guilty.  This petitioner refused to do,</p>\n<p>". . . at which time the two Public Officials left your Petitioner and at the time said they would have nothing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 326 U. S. 277</a></p><p> to do with Petitioner\'s trial scheduled for trial the following morning."</p>\n<p>The next day petitioner was arraigned and was read an information charging the murder to which he pleaded "not guilty," [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and</p>\n<p>"forthwith moved the Trial Court orally for a continuance of twenty-four (24) hours for the purpose of consulting counsel, examine the charge, subpoena witnesses, and prepare a defense, and forthwith the Trial Court overruled the motion for a continuance and ordered the trial to proceed, at which time the Clerk of the Court began to impanel the trial jury and had called two or three jurymen, when Joseph M. Lovely, a Public Official (Public Defender) and John N. Baldwin, his assistant stepped forward and entered the case, without ever having consulted your Petitioner, and without ever having been assigned by the Trial Court to represent your Petitioner."</p>\n<p>"Your Petitioner had no consultation whatsoever with either of the aforesaid Public Officials regarding his defense, they picked the jury and testimony was adduced, and a continuance or recess taken until the following morning March 18 (Wednesday), 1936."</p>\n<p>Petitioner claimed the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The record is either silent on or not inconsistent with anything material in these allegations.  <em>Cf. Tomkins v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/485/case.html">323 U. S. 485</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/485/case.html#487">323 U. S. 487</a></span>.  There is no allegation or suggestion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 326 U. S. 278</a></p><p> of ignorance of or unfamiliarity with procedural or substantive law or subnormal mentality.</p>\n<p>These facts, if true, we think, set out a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  They are not conclusions of law.  They are not too vague.  The charge upon which petitioner was convicted was murder in the first degree.  He had no advice of counsel prior to the calling of the jury.  His motion for continuance to examine the charge and consult counsel was made without assistance.  Homicide has degrees in Nebraska.Comp.Stat.Neb.1929, \xc2\xa7 28-401 to \xc2\xa7 28-403.  There are difficulties in the application of the rules.  <em>In re Cole,</em> 103 Neb. 802, 805, 174 N.W. 509, 848; <em>Bourne v. State,</em> 116 Neb. 141, 216 N.W. 173.  The defendant needs counsel, and counsel needs time.  <em>Cf. Tomkins v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/485/case.html">323 U.

As to the issue on the motion for continuance, our duty requires us to determine only whether or not the denial under the facts alleged violates due process.  We think there was an allegation that no effective assistance of counsel was furnished in the critical time between the plea of not guilty and the calling of the jury.  Continuance may or may not have been useful to the accused, but the importance of the assistance of counsel in a serious criminal charge after arraignment is too large to permit speculation on its effect.  We hold that denial of opportunity to consult with counsel on any material step after indictment or similar charge and arraignment violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner states a good cause of action when he alleges facts which support his contention that, through denial of asserted constitutional rights, he has not had the kind of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="279">Page 326 U. S. 279</a></p><p> trial in a state court which the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires.  This, of course, does not mean that uncontradicted evidence of a witness must be accepted as true on the hearing.  Credibility is for the trier of facts.  The evidence may show that the charge was served upon petitioner well in advance of the trial (<em>see</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">note 5</a> <em>supra</em>) and that he had ample opportunity to consult with counsel and secure any needed witnesses.

We do not consider this issue.</p>\n<p>The following reported cases show the efforts of petitioner to secure release.  There are other proceedings not reported.  <em>Hawk v. O\'Grady,</em> 137 Neb. 639, 290 N.W. 911 (appeal from denial of writ in state District Court), <em>cert. denied,</em> 311 U.S. 645; <em>Hawk v. Olson,</em> 130 F.2d 910 (appeal from denial of writ in District Court), <em>cert. denied,</em> 317 U.S. 697; 318 U.S. 746 (original); <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/114/case.html">321 U. S. 114</a></span> (original).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Lack of counsel and wrongful withholding by judicial officers of the necessary record form the substance of this claim.  The opinion of the Supreme Court of Nebraska disposes of this by pointing out that petitioner never alleged a request to the Public Defender for assistance on appeal, and that a mandamus (for the record) was denied.  We assume the denial was proper, as petitioner makes no complaint as to it.  On the present record, the failure to seek review from the conviction was without excuse.  16 N.W.2d 181, 184.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>This statute was reenacted as R.S. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 752-761.  The provision now appears in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 453:</p>\n<p>"The writ of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to a prisoner in jail unless where he is . . . in custody in violation of the Constitution or of a law or treaty of the United States. . . ."</p>\n<p>The section had its origin in a bill (No. 605) reported by the Judiciary Committee of the House in response to a resolution directing that committee to inquire and report to the House by bill or otherwise</p>\n<p>"what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States . . . to enforce the liberty of all persons under the operation of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 87, 4151.  The debates on the bill in the House and Senate, while mostly concerned with incidental matters, indicated that jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus was not intended to be limited merely to violations of the Thirteenth Amendment.  <em>See</em> Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 4150, 4151, 4229; Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 730, 790.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/28/193/case.html">Ex parte Watkins,</a></span></em> 3 Pet.193,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/28/193/case.html#202">28 U.
