S. 497</a>, this Court held that the Clean Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.  In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under \xc2\xa7111 of the Act, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants.  Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to issuing a final rule by May 2012.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.  Two groups of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners here.  One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts.  According to the complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the Nation.  By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs asserted, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law.  All plaintiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticiable political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed.  On the threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing.   On the merits, the court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal common law of nuisance,\xe2\x80\x9d relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other States or by out-of-state industry, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Milwaukee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/index.html">406 U. S. 91</a>, 93 <em>(Milwaukee I)</em>.  The court further determined that the Clean Air Act did not \xe2\x80\x9cdisplace\xe2\x80\x9d federal common law.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an equally divided Court.

Co.</em> v. <em>Tompkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a>, 78, recognized that there \xe2\x80\x9cis no federal general common law,\xe2\x80\x9d a new federal common law has emerged for subjects of national concern.  When dealing \xe2\x80\x9cwith air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a federal common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milwaukee I, </em>406 U. S., at 103.  Decisions of this Court predating <em>Erie</em>, but compatible with the emerging distinction between general common law and the new federal common law, have approved federal common-law suits brought by one State to abate pollution emanating from another State.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/180/208/index.html">180 U. S. 208</a>, 241\xe2\x80\x93243.  The plaintiffs contend that their right to maintain this suit follows from such cases.  But recognition that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily mean that federal courts should create the controlling law.  The Court need not address the question whether, absent the Clean Air Act and the EPA actions it authorizes, the plaintiffs could state a federal common-law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions because of their contribution to global warming.  Any such claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an unusual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milwaukee</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/index.html">451 U. S. 304</a>, 314 <em>(Milwaukee II)</em>.  Legislative displacement of federal common law does not require the \xe2\x80\x9csame sort of evidence of a clear and manifest [congressional] purpose\xe2\x80\x9d demanded for preemption of state law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 317.  Rather, the test is simply whether the statute \xe2\x80\x9cspeak[s] directly to [the] question\xe2\x80\x9d at issue.  <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Higginbotham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/index.html">436 U. S. 618</a>, 625.  Here, <em>Massachusetts </em>made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.  549 U. S., at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.  And it is equally plain that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks directly\xe2\x80\x9d to emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 plants.  The Act directs EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of stationary sources that, \xe2\x80\x9cin [the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccaus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(b)(1)(A).  Once EPA lists a category, it must establish performance standards for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that category, \xc2\xa77411(b)(1)(B), and, most relevant here, must regulate existing sources within the same category, \xc2\xa77411(d).  The Act also provides multiple avenues for enforcement.  If EPA does not <em>set </em>emissions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution, States and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s response will be reviewable in federal court.  See \xc2\xa77607(b)(1).  The Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plants\xe2\x80\x94the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law.  There is no room for a parallel track.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument, and the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA actually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions standards for the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 plants.  The relevant question for displacement purposes is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the field has been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a particular manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milwaukee II, </em>451 U. S., at 324.  The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered judgment\xe2\x80\x9d concerning air pollution regulation because it permits emissions until EPA acts.  The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation displaces federal common law.  If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed order of decisionmaking\xe2\x80\x94first by the expert agency, and then by federal judges\xe2\x80\x94is yet another reason to resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.  The appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse gas-producing sector requires informed assessment of competing interests.  The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in the first instance, in combination with state regulators.  The expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges, who lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to have federal judges determine, in the first instance, what amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d and what level of reduction is necessary cannot be reconciled with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 scheme.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs also sought relief under state nuisance law.  The Second Circuit did not reach those claims because it held that federal common law governed.  In light of the holding here that the Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability <em>vel non</em> of a state lawsuit depends, <em>inter alia</em>, on the preemptive effect of the federal Act.  Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance law, the matter is left for consideration on remand.

As relief, the plaintiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.  The Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency action the Act authorizes, we hold, displace the claims the plaintiffs seek to pursue.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/497/index.html">549 U. S. 497</a> (2007), this Court held that the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S.

Reg. 66499 (2009).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Massachusetts</em> held that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread the Clean Air Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.  549 U. S., at 510\xe2\x80\x93511.  Greenhouse gases, we determined, qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cair pollutant[s]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the governing Clean Air Act provision, <em>id.</em>, at 528\xe2\x80\x93529 (quoting \xc2\xa77602(g)); they are therefore within EPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory ken.  Because EPA had authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards and had offered no \xe2\x80\x9creasoned explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for failing to do so, we concluded that the agency had not acted \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with law\xe2\x80\x9d when it denied the requested rulemaking.  <em>Id.</em>, at 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (quoting \xc2\xa77607(d)(9)(A)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to our decision in <em>Massachusetts</em>, EPA un-dertook greenhouse gas regulation.  In December 2009, the agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles \xe2\x80\x9ccause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d the Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory trigger.  \xc2\xa77521(a)(1); 74 Fed. Reg. 66496.  The agency observed that \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are now at elevated and essentially unprecedented levels,\xe2\x80\x9d almost entirely \xe2\x80\x9cdue to anthropogenic emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 66517; mean global temperatures, the agency continued, demonstrate an \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous warming trend over the last 100 years,\xe2\x80\x9d and particularly \xe2\x80\x9cover the past 30 years,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Acknowledging that not all scientists agreed on the causes and consequences of the rise in global temperatures, <em>id.</em>, at 66506, 66518, 66523\xe2\x80\x9366524, EPA concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d evidence supported the \xe2\x80\x9cattribution of observed climate change to anthropogenic\xe2\x80\x9d emissions of greenhouse gases, <em>id</em>., at 66518.  Consequent dangers of greenhouse gas emissions, EPA determined, included increases in heat-related deaths; coastal inundation and erosion caused by melting icecaps and rising sea levels; more frequent and intense hurricanes, floods, and other \xe2\x80\x9cextreme weather events\xe2\x80\x9d that cause death and destroy infrastructure; drought due to reductions in mountain snowpack and shifting precipitation patterns; destruction of ecosystems supporting animals and plants; and potentially \xe2\x80\x9csignificant disruptions\xe2\x80\x9d of food production.  <em>Id.</em>, at 66524\xe2\x80\x9366535.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA and the Department of Transportation subsequently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from light-duty vehicles, see 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010), and initiated a joint rulemaking covering medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, see <em>id.</em>, at 74152.  EPA also began phasing in requirements that new or modified \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ajor [greenhouse gas] emitting facilities\xe2\x80\x9d use the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available control technology.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77475(a)(4); 75 Fed.

In July 2004, two groups of plaintiffs filed separate complaints in the Southern District of New York against the same five major electric power companies.  The first group of plaintiffs included eight States[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and New York City, the second joined three nonprofit land trusts[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]; both groups are respondents here.  The defendants, now petitioners, are four private companies[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned corporation that operates fossil-fuel fired power plants in several States.  According to the complaints, the defendants \xe2\x80\x9care the five largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 57, 118.  Their collective annual emissions of 650 million tons constitute 25 percent of emissions from the domestic electric power sector, 10 percent of emissions from all domestic human activities, <em>ibid.</em>, and 2.5 percent of all anthropogenic emissions worldwide, App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs asserted, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 carbon-dioxide emissions created\na \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial and unreasonable interference with public rights,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law.  App. 103\xe2\x80\x93105, 145\xe2\x80\x93147.  The States and New York City alleged that public lands, infrastructure, and health were at risk from climate change.  App. 88\xe2\x80\x9393.  The trusts urged that climate change would destroy habitats for animals and rare species of trees and plants on land the trusts owned and conserved.  App. 139\xe2\x80\x93145.  All plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring each defendant \xe2\x80\x9cto cap</p>\n<p>\n\n its carbon dioxide emissions and then reduce them by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 110, 153.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting non-justiciable political questions, citing <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Carr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/index.html">369 U. S. 186</a> (1962), but the Second Circuit reversed, 582 F.\xc2\xa03d 309 (2009).  On the threshold questions, the Court of Appeals held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine, <em>id.</em>, at 332, and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing, <em>id.</em>, at 349.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the merits, the Second Circuit held that all plaintiffs had stated a claim under the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal common law of nuisance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 358, 371.  For this determination, the court relied dominantly on a series of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other States or by out-of-state industry.  <em>Id.</em>, at 350\xe2\x80\x93351; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Milwaukee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/index.html">406 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251 <em>et seq.</em>  That legislation installed an all-encompassing regulatory program, supervised by an expert administrative agency, to deal comprehensively with interstate water pollution.

Four members of the\nCourt would hold that at least some plaintiffs have Article III standing under <em>Massachusetts</em>, which permitted a State to challenge EPA\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, 549 U.

And we think it equally plain that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks directly\xe2\x80\x9d to emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 plants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 111 of the Act directs the EPA Administrator to list \xe2\x80\x9ccategories of stationary sources\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cin [her] judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pol-lution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(b)(1)(A).  Once EPA lists a category, the agency must establish standards of performance for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that category.  \xc2\xa77411(b)(1)(B); see also \xc2\xa77411(a)(2).  And, most relevant here, \xc2\xa77411(d) then requires regulation of existing sources within the same category.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  For existing sources, EPA issues emissions guidelines, see 40 C. F. R. \xc2\xa760.22, .23 (2009); in compliance with those guidelines and subject to federal oversight, the States then issue performance standards for stationary sources within their jurisdiction, \xc2\xa77411(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act provides multiple avenues for enforcement.  See <em>County of Oneida</em>, 470 U. S., at 237\xe2\x80\x93239 (reach of remedial provisions is important to determination whether statute displaces federal common law).  EPA may delegate im-plementation and enforcement authority to the States, \xc2\xa77411(c)(1), (d)(1), but the agency retains the power to in-spect and monitor regulated sources, to impose administrative penalties for noncompliance, and to commence civil actions against polluters in federal court.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77411(c)(2), (d)(2), 7413, 7414.  In specified circumstances, the Act im-poses criminal penalties on any person who knowingly violates emissions standards issued under \xc2\xa77411.  See \xc2\xa77413(c).  And the Act provides for private enforcement.  If States (or EPA) fail to enforce emissions limits against regulated sources, the Act permits \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a civil enforcement action in federal court.  \xc2\xa77604(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If EPA does not <em>set </em>emissions limits for a particular pol-lutant or source of pollution, States and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPA\xe2\x80\x99s response will be reviewable in federal court.  See \xc2\xa77607(b)(1); <em>Massachusetts</em>, 549 U. S., at 516\xe2\x80\x93517, 529.  As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, EPA is currently engaged in a \xc2\xa77411 rulemaking to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants.  To settle litigation brought under \xc2\xa77607(b) by a group that included the majority of the plaintiffs in this very case, the agency agreed to complete that rulemaking by May 2012.  75 Fed. Reg. 82392.  The Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plants\xe2\x80\x94the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law.  We see no room for a parallel track.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs argue, as the Second Circuit held, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA actually exercises its regulatory authority, <em>i.e.</em>, until it sets standards governing emissions from the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 plants.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sewage discharges at issue in <em>Milwaukee II</em>, we do not overlook, were subject to effluent limits set by EPA; under the displacing statute, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very<em> </em>point source discharge\xe2\x80\x9d of water pollution was \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited unless covered by a permit.\xe2\x80\x9d  451 U. S., at 318\xe2\x80\x93320 (emphasis deleted).  As <em>Milwaukee II</em> made clear, however, the relevant question for purposes of displacement is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the field\nhas been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a particular manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 324.  Of necessity, Congress se-lects different regulatory regimes to address different problems.  Congress could hardly preemptively prohibit every discharge of carbon dioxide unless covered by a permit.  After all, we each emit carbon dioxide merely by breathing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered judgment\xe2\x80\x9d concerning the regulation of air pollution because it permits emissions <em>until</em> EPA\nacts.  See <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority</em> v. <em>National Sea Clammers Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/index.html">453 U. S. 1</a>, 22, n. 32 (1981) (finding displacement although Congress \xe2\x80\x9callowed some continued dumping of sludge\xe2\x80\x9d prior to a certain date).  The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation is what displaces federal common law.  Indeed, were EPA to decline to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions altogether at the conclusion of its ongoing \xc2\xa77411 rulemaking, the federal courts would have no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset the agency\xe2\x80\x99s expert determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, we hasten to add, would not escape judicial review.  Federal courts, we earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 11, can review agency action (or a final rule declining to take action) to ensure compliance with the statute Congress enacted.  As we have noted, see <em>supra</em>,\nat 10, the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish emis-\nsions standards for categories of stationary sources that, \xe2\x80\x9cin [the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccaus[e], or contri-but[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(b)(1)(A).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he use of the word \xe2\x80\x98judgment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we explained in <em>Massachusetts</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a roving license to ignore the statutory text.\xe2\x80\x9d  549 U. S., at 533.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is but a direction to exercise discretion within defined statutory limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> EPA may not decline to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants if refusal to act would be \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77607(d)(9)(A).  If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome\nof EPA\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse under federal law is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari in this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, this prescribed order of decisionmaking\xe2\x80\x94the first decider under the Act is the expert administrative agency, the second, federal judges\xe2\x80\x94is yet another reason to resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.  The appropriate amount of regulation in any particular greenhouse gas-producing sector cannot be prescribed in a vacuum: as with other questions of national or international policy, informed assessment of competing interests is required.  Along with the environmental benefit potentially achievable, our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s energy needs and the possibility of economic disruption must weigh in the balance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in the first instance, in combination with state regulators.  Each \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of performance\xe2\x80\x9d EPA sets must \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] into account the cost of achieving [emissions] reduction and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), (d)(1); see also 40 C. F.\xc2\xa0R. \xc2\xa760.24(f) (EPA may permit\nstate plans to deviate from generally applicable emissions standards upon demonstration that costs are \xe2\x80\x9c[u]n-reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).  EPA may \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguish among classes, types, and sizes\xe2\x80\x9d of stationary sources in apportioning responsibility for emissions reductions.  \xc2\xa77411(b)(2), (d); see also 40 C. F. R. \xc2\xa760.22(b)(5).  And the agency may waive compliance with emission limits to permit a facility to test drive an \xe2\x80\x9cinnovative technological system\xe2\x80\x9d that has \xe2\x80\x9cnot [yet] been adequately demonstrated.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77411(j)(1)(A).  The Act envisions extensive cooperation between federal and state authorities, see \xc2\xa77401(a), (b), generally permitting each State to take the first cut at determining how best to achieve EPA emissions standards within its domain, see \xc2\xa77411(c)(1), (d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an ex-pert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as pri-\nmary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions.  The expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad\xc2\xa0hoc, case-by-case injunctions.  Federal judges lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order.  See generally <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 865\xe2\x80\x93866 (1984).  Judges may not commission scientific studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or issue rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting input by any interested person, or seek the counsel of regulators in the States where the defendants are located.  Rather, judges are confined by a record comprising the evidence the parties present.  Moreover, federal district judges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to render precedential decisions binding other judges, even members of the same court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding these disabilities, the plaintiffs propose that individual federal judges determine, in the first instance, what amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 103, 145, and then decide what level of reduction is \xe2\x80\x9cpractical, feasible and economically viable,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 58, 119.  These determinations would be made for the defendants named in the two lawsuits launched by the plaintiffs.  Similar suits could be mounted, counsel for the States and New York City estimated, against \xe2\x80\x9cthousands or hundreds or tens\xe2\x80\x9d of other defendants fitting the description \xe2\x80\x9clarge contributors\xe2\x80\x9d to carbon-dioxide emissions.

The Second Circuit erred, we hold, in ruling that federal judges may set limits on greenhouse gas emissions in face of a law empowering EPA to set the same limits, subject to judicial review only to ensure against action \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, \xe2\x80\xa6 or otherwise not in accordance with law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77607(d)(9).</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs also sought relief under state law, in particular, the law of each State where the defendants operate power plants.
