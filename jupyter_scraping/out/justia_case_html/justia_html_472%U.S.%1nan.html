Through a wholly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 472 U. S. 3</a></p><p> owned subsidiary, Burlington proposed to purchase 25.1 million El Paso shares at $24 per share.  Burlington reserved the right to terminate the offer if any of several specified events occurred.  El Paso management initially opposed the takeover, but its shareholders responded favorably, fully subscribing the offer by the December 30, 1982, deadline.</p>\n<p>Burlington did not accept those tendered shares; instead, after negotiations with El Paso management, Burlington announced on January 10, 1983, the terms of a new and friendly takeover agreement.  Pursuant to the new agreement, Burlington undertook, <em>inter alia,</em> to (1) rescind the December tender offer, (2) purchase 4,166,667 shares from El Paso at $24 per share, (3) substitute a new tender offer for only 21 million shares at $24 per share, (4) provide procedural protections against a squeeze-out merger [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] of the remaining El Paso shareholders, and (5) recognize "golden parachute" [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] contracts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 472 U. S. 4</a></p><p> between El Paso and four of its senior officers.  By February 8, more than 40 million shares were tendered in response to Burlington\'s January offer, and the takeover was completed.</p>\n<p>The rescission of the first tender offer caused a diminished payment to those shareholders who had tendered during the first offer.  The January offer was greatly oversubscribed, and consequently those shareholders who retendered were subject to substantial proration.  Petitioner Barbara Schreiber filed suit on behalf of herself and similarly situated shareholders, alleging that Burlington, El Paso, and members of El Paso\'s board of directors violated \xc2\xa7 14(e)\'s prohibition of "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices . . . in connection with any tender offer."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(e).  She claimed that Burlington\'s withdrawal of the December tender offer, coupled with the substitution of the January tender offer, was a "manipulative" distortion of the market for El Paso stock.  Schreiber also alleged that Burlington violated \xc2\xa7 14(e) by failing in the January offer to disclose the "golden parachutes" offered to four of El Paso\'s managers.  She claims that this January nondisclosure was a deceptive act forbidden by \xc2\xa7 14(e).</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim.  568 F.Supp.197 (Del.1983).  The District Court reasoned that the alleged manipulation did not involve a misrepresentation, and so did not violate \xc2\xa7 14(e).  The District Court relied on the fact that, in cases involving alleged violations of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78j(b), this Court has required misrepresentation for there to be a "manipulative" violation of the section.  568 F.Supp. at 202.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  731 F.2d 163 (1984).  The Court of Appeals held that the acts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 472 U. S. 5</a></p><p> alleged did not violate the Williams Act, because</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 14(e) was not intended to create a federal cause of action for all harms suffered because of the proffering or the withdrawal of tender offers."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 165.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that \xc2\xa7 14(e) was</p>\n<p>"enacted principally as a disclosure statute, designed to insure that fully-informed investors could intelligently decide how to respond to a tender offer."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 165-166.  It concluded that the "arguable breach of contract" alleged by petitioner was not a "manipulative act" under \xc2\xa7 14(e).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] 469 U.S. 815 (1984).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We are asked in this case to interpret \xc2\xa7 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, 82 Stat. 457, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(e).  The starting point is the language of the statute.  Section 14(e) provides:</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer, request, or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 472 U. S. 6</a></p><p> invitation.  The Commission shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative."</p>\n<p>Petitioner relies on a construction of the phrase, "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices."  Petitioner reads the phrase "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices" to include acts which, although fully disclosed, "artificially" affect the price of the takeover target\'s stock.  Petitioner\'s interpretation relies on the belief that \xc2\xa7 14(e) is directed at purposes broader than providing full and true information to investors.</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s reading of the term "manipulative" conflicts with the normal meaning of the term.  We have held in the context of an alleged violation of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act:</p>\n<p>"Use of the word \'manipulative\' is especially significant.  It is and was virtually a term of art when used in connection with the securities markets.  It connotes intentional or willful conduct <em>designed to deceive or defraud</em> investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities."</p>\n<p><em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html">425 U. S. 185</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html#199">425 U. S. 199</a></span> (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Other cases interpreting the term reflect its use as a general term comprising a range of misleading practices:</p>\n<p>"The term refers generally to practices, such as wash sales, matched orders, or rigged prices, that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity. . . .  Section 10(b)\'s general prohibition of practices deemed by the SEC to be "manipulative" -- in this technical sense of artificially affecting market activity in order to mislead investors -- is fully consistent with the fundamental purpose of the 1934 Act "<em>to substitute </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 472 U. S. 7</a></em></p><p><em> a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of <em>caveat emptor.</em> . . .\'" . . .  Indeed, nondisclosure is usually essential to the success of a manipulative scheme. . . .  No doubt Congress meant to prohibit the full range of ingenious devices that might be used to manipulate securities prices.  But we do not think it would have chosen this "term of art" if it had meant to bring within the scope of \xc2\xa7 10(b) instances of corporate mismanagement such as this, in which the essence of the complaint is that shareholders were treated unfairly by a fiduciary." </em></p>\n<p><em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/462/case.html">430 U. S. 462</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/462/case.html#476">430 U. S. 476</a></span>-477 (1977).  The meaning the Court has given the term "manipulative" is consistent with the use of the term at common law, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and with its traditional dictionary definition. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>She argues, however, that the term "manipulative" takes on a meaning in \xc2\xa7 14(e) that is different from the meaning it has in \xc2\xa7 10(b).  Petitioner claims that the use of the disjunctive "or" in \xc2\xa7 14(e) implies that acts need not be deceptive or fraudulent to be manipulative.  But Congress used the phrase "manipulative or deceptive" in \xc2\xa7 10(b) as well, and we have interpreted "manipulative" in that context to require </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 472 U. S. 8</a></p><p> misrepresentation. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Moreover, it is a "<em>familiar principle of statutory construction that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\'"  <em>Securities Industry Assn. v. Board of Governors, FRS,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/207/case.html">468 U. S. 207</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/207/case.html#218">468 U. S. 218</a></span> (1984).  All three species of misconduct, <em>i.e.,</em> "fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative," listed by Congress are directed at failures to disclose.  The use of the term "manipulative" provides emphasis and guidance to those who must determine which types of acts are reached by the statute; it does not suggest a deviation from the section\'s facial and primary concern with disclosure or congressional concern with disclosure which is the core of the Act.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that "manipulative" acts under \xc2\xa7 14(e) require misrepresentation or nondisclosure is buttressed by the purpose and legislative history of the provision.  Section 14(e) was originally added to the Securities Exchange Act as part of the Williams Act, 82 Stat. 457.</p>\n<p>"The purpose of the Williams Act is to insure that public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information."</p>\n<p><em>Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/49/case.html">422 U. S. 49</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/49/case.html#58">422 U. S. 58</a></span> (1975). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>It is clear that Congress relied primarily on disclosure to implement the purpose of the Williams Act.  Senator Williams, the bill\'s Senate sponsor, stated in the debate:</p>\n<p>"Today, the public shareholder, in deciding whether to accept or reject a tender offer, possesses limited information.  No matter what he does, he acts without adequate knowledge to enable him to decide rationally what is the best course of action.  This is precisely the dilemma </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 472 U. S. 9</a></p><p> which our securities laws are designed to prevent."</p>\n<p>113 Cong.Rec. 24664 (1967).</p>\n<p>The expressed legislative intent was to preserve a neutral setting in which the contenders could fully present their arguments. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Senate sponsor went on to say:</p>\n<p>"We have taken extreme care to avoid tipping the scales either in favor of management or in favor of the person making the takeover bids.  S. 510 is designed solely to require full and fair disclosure for the benefit of investors.  The bill will at the same time provide the offeror and management equal opportunity to present their case."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>To implement this objective, the Williams Act added \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13(d), 13(e), 14(d), 14(e), and 14(f) to the Securities Exchange Act.  Some relate to disclosure; \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13(d), 14(d), and 14(f) all add specific registration and disclosure provisions.  Others -- \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13(e) and 14(d) -- require or prohibit certain acts so that investors will possess additional time within which to take advantage of the disclosed information. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 472 U. S. 10</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Section 14(e) adds a "broad antifraud prohibition," <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/1/case.html">430 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/1/case.html#24">430 U. S. 24</a></span> (1977), modeled on the antifraud provisions of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.10b-5 (1984). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  It supplements the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 472 U. S. 11</a></p><p> more precise disclosure provisions found elsewhere in the Williams Act, while requiring disclosure more explicitly addressed to the tender offer context than that required by \xc2\xa7 10(b).</p>\n<p>While legislative history specifically concerning \xc2\xa7 14(e) is sparse, the House and Senate Reports discuss the role of \xc2\xa7 14(e).  Describing \xc2\xa7 14(e) as regulating "fraudulent transactions," and stating the thrust of the section:</p>\n<p>"This provision would affirm the fact that persons engaged in making or opposing tender offers or otherwise seeking to influence the decision of investors or the outcome of the tender offer are under an obligation to make <em>full disclosure</em> of material information to those with whom they deal."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1711, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 11 (1968) (emphasis added); S.Rep. No. 550, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1967) (emphasis added).  Nowhere in the legislative history is there the slightest suggestion that \xc2\xa7 14(e) serves any purpose other than disclosure, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] or that the term "manipulative" should be read as an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 472 U. S. 12</a></p><p> invitation to the courts to oversee the substantive fairness of tender offers; the quality of any offer is a matter for the marketplace.</p>\n<p>To adopt the reading of the term "manipulative" urged by petitioner would not only be unwarranted in light of the legislative purpose, but would be at odds with it.  Inviting judges to read the term "manipulative" with their own sense of what constitutes "unfair" or "artificial" conduct would inject uncertainty into the tender offer process.  An essential piece of information -- whether the court would deem the fully disclosed actions of one side or the other to be "manipulative" -- would not be available until after the tender offer had closed.  This uncertainty would directly contradict the expressed congressional desire to give investors full information.</p>\n<p>Congress\' consistent emphasis on disclosure persuades us that it intended takeover contests to be addressed to shareholders.  In pursuit of this goal, Congress, consistent with the core mechanism of the Securities Exchange Act, created sweeping disclosure requirements and narrow substantive safeguards.  The same Congress that placed such emphasis on shareholder choice would not at the same time have required judges to oversee tender offers for substantive fairness.  It is even less likely that a Congress implementing that intention would express it only through the use of a single word placed in the middle of a provision otherwise devoted to disclosure.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>We hold that the term "manipulative," as used in \xc2\xa7 14(e), requires misrepresentation or nondisclosure.  It connotes "conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities."  <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</em> 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/case.html#199">425 U. S. 199</a></span>.  Without misrepresentation or nondisclosure, \xc2\xa7 14(e) has not been violated.</p>\n<p>Applying that definition to this case, we hold that the actions of respondents were not manipulative.  The amended complaint fails to allege that the cancellation of the first </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 472 U. S. 13</a></p><p> tender offer was accompanied by any misrepresentation, nondisclosure, or deception.  The District Court correctly found:  "All activity of the defendants that could have conceivably affected the price of El Paso shares was done openly."  568 F.Supp. at 203.</p>\n<p>Petitioner also alleges that El Paso management and Burlington entered into certain undisclosed and deceptive agreements during the making of the second tender offer.  The substance of the allegations is that, in return for certain undisclosed benefits, El Paso managers agreed to support the second tender offer.  But both courts noted that petitioner\'s complaint seeks only redress for injuries related to the cancellation of the first tender offer.  Since the deceptive and misleading acts alleged by petitioner all occurred with reference to the making of the second tender offer -- when the injuries suffered by petitioner had already been sustained -- these acts bear no possible causal relationship to petitioner\'s alleged injuries.  The Court of Appeals dealt correctly with this claim.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>A "squeeze-out" merger occurs when Corporation A, which holds a controlling interest in Corporation B, uses its control to merge B into itself or into a wholly owned subsidiary.  The minority shareholders in Corporation B are, in effect, forced to sell their stock.  The procedural protection provided in the agreement between El Paso and Burlington required the approval of non-Burlington members of El Paso\'s board of directors before a squeeze-out merger could proceed.  Burlington eventually purchased all the remaining shares of El Paso for $12 cash and one-quarter share of Burlington preferred stock per share.  The parties dispute whether this consideration was equal to that paid to those tendering during the January tender offer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner alleged in her complaint that respondent Burlington failed to disclose that four officers of El Paso had entered into "golden parachute" agreements with El Paso for</p>\n<p>"extended employment benefits in the event El Paso should be taken over, which benefits would give them millions of dollars of extra compensation."</p>\n<p>The term "golden parachute" refers generally to agreements between a corporation and its top officers which guarantee those officers continued employment, payment of a lump sum, or other benefits in the event of a change of corporate ownership.  As described in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by El Paso with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 12, 1983, El Paso entered into "employment agreements" with two of its officers for a period of not less than five years, and with two other officers for a period of three years.  The Schedule 14D-9 also disclosed that El Paso\'s Deferred Compensation Plan had been amended</p>\n<p>"to provide that for the purposes of such Plan a participant shall be deemed to have retired at the instance of the Company if his duties as a director, officer or employee of the Company have been diminished or curtailed by the Company in any material respect."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that manipulation does not always require an element of misrepresentation or nondisclosure.  <em>Mobil Corp. v.

For example, as the bill progressed through hearings, both Houses of Congress became concerned that corporate stock repurchases could be used to distort the market for corporate control.  Congress addressed this problem with \xc2\xa7 13(e), which imposes specific disclosure duties on corporations purchasing stock and grants broad regulatory power to the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate such repurchases.  Congress stopped short, however, of imposing specific substantive requirements forbidding corporations to trade in their own stock for the purpose of maintaining its price.  The specific regulatory scheme set forth in \xc2\xa7 13(e) would be unnecessary if Congress at the same time had endowed the term "manipulative" in \xc2\xa7 14(e) with broad substantive significance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 13(d) requires those acquiring a certain threshold percentage of a company\'s stock to file reports disclosing such information as the purchaser\'s background and identity, the source of the funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent of the purchaser\'s holdings in the target company.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78m(d).  Section 13(e) imposes restrictions on certain repurchases of stock by corporate issuers.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78m(e).  Section 14(d) imposes specific disclosure requirements on those making a tender offer.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(d)(1).  Section 14(d) also imposes specific substantive requirements on those making a tender offer.  These requirements include allowing shareholders to withdraw tendered shares at certain times during the bidding process, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(d)(5), the proration of share purchases when the number of shares tendered exceeds the number of shares sought, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(d)(6), and the payment of the same price to all those whose shares are purchased, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(d)(7).  Section 14(f) imposes disclosure requirements when new corporate directors are chosen as the result of a tender offer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 10(b) provides:</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . ."</p>\n<p>"(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78j(b).  Rule 10b-5 provides:</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,"</p>\n<p>"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,"</p>\n<p>"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or"</p>\n<p>"(c) To engage in any act, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."</p>\n<p>17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.10b-5 (1984).</p>\n<p>Because of the textual similarities, it is often assumed that \xc2\xa7 14(e) was modeled on \xc2\xa7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  <em>See, e.g., Panter v. Marshall Field &amp; Co.,</em> 646 F.2d 271, 283 (CA7), <em>cert. denied,</em> 454 U.S. 1092 (1981).  For the purpose of interpreting the term "manipulative," the most significant changes from the language of \xc2\xa7 10(b) were the addition of the term "fraudulent," and the reference to "acts" rather than "devices."  Neither change bears in any obvious way on the meaning to be given to "manipulative."</p>\n<p>Similar terminology is also found in \xc2\xa7 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78O(C), \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77q(a), and \xc2\xa7 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-6.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Act was amended in 1970, and Congress added to \xc2\xa7 14(e) the sentence,</p>\n<p>"The Commission shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative."</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that this phrase would be pointless if \xc2\xa7 14(e) was concerned with disclosure only.</p>\n<p>We disagree.  In adding the 1970 amendment, Congress simply provided a mechanism for defining and guarding against those acts and practices which involve material misrepresentation or nondisclosure.  The amendment gives the Securities and Exchange Commission latitude to regulate nondeceptive activities as a "reasonably designed" means of preventing manipulative acts, without suggesting any change in the meaning of the term "manipulative" itself.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
