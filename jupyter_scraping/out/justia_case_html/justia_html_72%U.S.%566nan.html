JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In the view which we have taken of the case, it will be necessary to consider but a single point.</p>\n<p>The appellants filed their libel to recover damages for the sinking of their steamer <em>Huron</em> in the Chicago River near its mouth.  The casualty was caused by the steamer\'s running against a sunken wreck.  The libel alleges that it was the duty of the city to have it removed and that it was guilty of negligence in not having done so.  It alleges further that the city entered upon the work of removal but abandoned it before the result was accomplished.</p>\n<p>Among the defenses set up by the answer of the respondent was that of a final judgment in the Supreme Court of Illinois, upon a general demurrer to a declaration in an action at law by the appellants against the respondent for the same cause of action.</p>\n<p>The court below sustained the defense, and upon this ground, and another not necessary to be stated, dismissed the libel.</p>\n<p>The record of the action at law is found among the proofs in this case.  Upon a careful examination of the declaration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 72 U.
