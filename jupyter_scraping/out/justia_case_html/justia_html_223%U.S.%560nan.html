S. 563</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a bill brought by the United States to annul </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 223 U. S. 564</a></p><p> patents for lands lying within the indemnity limits of the grant made to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of March 3, 1871, c. 122, \xc2\xa7 23, 16 Stat. 573, 579, known as the branch-line grant, and within the grant made to the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 292.  The Atlantic &amp; Pacific road forfeited its grant (Act of July 6, 1886, c. 637, 24 Stat. 123), and thereafter the Southern Pacific selected the two parcels in question, as indemnity under its branch-line grant, one of them lying within the granted, and the other within the indemnity, limits of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific.  It relies on the general principle that whether lands are subject to selection as indemnity depends upon the state of the lands at the time the selection is made.  <em>Ryan v. Railroad Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/382/case.html">99 U. S. 382</a></span>.  The circuit court, however, held that the right in this particular case had been decided not to exist (152 F. 314), and the circuit court of appeals affirmed the decree (167 F. 514).</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the decision was right.  In <em>Southern Pacific Railroad Company v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/1/case.html">168 U. S. 1</a></span>, the lands in controversy embraced, among others, as stated by Mr. Justice Harlan,</p>\n<p>"lands within the Southern Pacific indemnity limits and the Atlantic &amp; Pacific granted limits; [and] lands within the common indemnity limits of both grants."</p>\n<p><em>Id.,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/1/case.html#47">168 U. S. 47</a></span>.  It was held that the forfeiture to the United States did not enlarge the right of the southern Pacific to select the lands in question, and the decree was for the United States.  The proposition laid down in <em>United States v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/570/case.html">146 U. S. 570</a></span>, and <em>United States v. Colton Marble &amp; Lime Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/615/case.html">146 U. S. 615</a></span>, was applied to Southern Pacific branch-line indemnity lands.  Whatever may be thought of the grounds for making an exception to the principle of <em>Ryan v. Railroad Co. supra,</em> the exception was established for this case.  An elaborate argument was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 223 U. S. 565</a></p><p> made on petition for rehearing that the decision could not be extended to indemnity lands, but the petition was denied.  In <em>Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/183/519/case.html">183 U. S. 519</a></span>, the dismissal of the bill without prejudice to claims that by interpretation are said to include indemnity claims imports no limitation of the previously established law, and, on the other hand, in <em>Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/447/case.html">189 U. S. 447</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/447/case.html#451">189 U.

S. 168</a></span> U.S. 1 was followed, and the practice of the Land Department in accordance with that decision was mentioned as a further ground.  There may be distinctions between the latest decision and this, but, in view of the rightly established understanding, it is too late to set them up now.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
