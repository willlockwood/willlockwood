Argued November 3, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 15, 2003</p>\n<p align="left">A police officer stopped a car for speeding at 3:16 a.m.; searched the car, seizing $763 from the glove compartment and cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest; and arrested the car\xe2\x80\x99s three occupants after they denied ownership of the drugs and money.  Respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine, and was sentenced to 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed, but the State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when Pringle was a front-seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner was insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle, the arrest did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Maryland law authorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests, <em>inter alia</em>, where the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or is being committed in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  Here, it is uncontested that the officer, upon recovering the suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed; the question is whether he had probable cause to believe Pringle committed that crime.  The \xe2\x80\x9csubstance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brinegar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/index.html">338 U. S. 160</a>, 175, and that belief must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized, <em>Ybarra</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/85/index.html">444 U. S. 85</a>, 91.  To determine whether an officer had probable cause to make an arrest, a court must examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\xe2\x80\x9d probable cause.  <em>Ornelas</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/690/index.html">517 U. S. 690</a>, 696.  As it is an entirely reasonable inference from the facts here that any or all of the car\xe2\x80\x99s occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine, a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.  Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to characterize this as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  <em>Ybarra</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <em>supra,</em> and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Di Re,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/581/index.html">332 U.

The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.  After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money, the officer arrested each of them.  We hold that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle\xe2\x80\x94one of the three men.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger.  The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment.  The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlow\xe2\x80\x99s license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest.  When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat.  The officer pulled down the armrest and found the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.  The men offered no information regarding the ownership of the drugs or money.  All three were placed under arrest and transported to the police station.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), and gave an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or \xe2\x80\x9c[u]se it for sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 26.  Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the car did not know about the drugs, and they were released.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court denied Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle.  A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine.  He was sentenced to 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed.  141 Md. App. 292, 785 A.\xc2\xa02d 790 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when [Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 Md. 525, 545, 805 A.\xc2\xa02d 1016, 1027 (2002).  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/921/index.html">538 U. S. 921</a> (2003), and now reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html">367 U.

S. Const., Amdt. 4.  Maryland law authorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests, <em>inter alia</em>, for felonies committed in an officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence or where an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or is being committed in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, \xc2\xa7594B (1996) (repealed 2001).  A warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if the arrest is supported by probable cause.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Watson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/index.html">423 U. S. 411</a>, 424 (1976); see <em>Atwater</em> v. <em>Lago Vista, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/318/index.html">532 U. S. 318</a>, 354 (2001) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is uncontested in the present case that the officer, upon recovering the five plastic glassine baggies containing suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed.  Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, \xc2\xa7287 (1996) (repealed 2002) (prohibiting possession of controlled dangerous substances).  The sole question is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle committed that crime.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The long-prevailing standard of probable cause protects \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens from rash and unreasonable interferences with privacy and from unfounded charges of crime,\xe2\x80\x9d while giving \xe2\x80\x9cfair leeway for enforcing the law in the community\xe2\x80\x99s protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brinegar</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/index.html"></a><a href="/us/338/160/index.html">338 U. S. 160</a>, 176 (1949).  On many occasions, we have reiterated that the probable-cause standard is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98practical, nontechnical conception\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that deals with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Gates,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/213/index.html">462 U.

S. 1</a>, 7\xe2\x80\x938 (1989).  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]robable cause is a fluid concept\xe2\x80\x94turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\xe2\x80\x94not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gates</em>, 462 U. S., at 232.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The probable-cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification into percentages because it deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Brinegar</em>, 338 U. S., at 175.  We have stated, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized, <em>Ybarra</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/85/index.html">444 U. S. 85</a>, 91 (1979).  In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates,</em> we noted:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAs early as <em>Locke</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 7 Cranch 339, 348 (1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a closely related context: \xe2\x80\x98[T]he term \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause,\xe2\x80\x9d according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99  More recently, we said that \xe2\x80\x98the <em>quanta</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 of proof\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 appropriate in ordinary judicial proceedings are inapplicable to the decision to issue a warrant.  <em>Brinegar, </em>338 U. S., at 173.  Finely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the [probable-cause] decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U. S., at 235.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine whether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\xe2\x80\x9d probable cause, <em>Ornelas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 696.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, Pringle was one of three men riding in a Nissan Maxima at 3:16 a.m.  There was $763 of rolled-up cash in the glove compartment directly in front of Pringle.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men.  Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.  Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  His reliance on <em>Ybarra</em> v. <em>Illinois, supra,</em> and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Di Re,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/581/index.html">332 U. S. 581</a> (1948), is misplaced.  In <em>Ybarra</em>, police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance.  Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarra\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] person\xe2\x80\x99s mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.  <em>Sibron</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/40/index.html">392 U. S. 40</a>, 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (1968).  Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.  This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  444 U. S., at 91.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe held that the search warrant did not permit body searches of all of the tavern\xe2\x80\x99s patrons and that the police could not pat down the patrons for weapons, absent individualized suspicion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 92.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is quite different from <em>Ybarra</em>.  Pringle and his two companions were in a relatively small automobile, not a public tavern.  In <em>Wyoming</em> v. <em>Houghton, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/295/index.html">526 U. S. 295</a> (1999), we noted that \xe2\x80\x9ca car passenger\xe2\x80\x94unlike the unwitting tavern patron in <em>Ybarra</em>\xe2\x80\x94will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 304\xe2\x80\x93305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Di Re</em>, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat and Di Re in the front passenger\xe2\x80\x99s seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Re\xe2\x80\x99s possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592\xe2\x80\x93594.  We said \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 594.  No such singling out occurred in this case; none of the three men provided information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or money.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance.  Pringle\xe2\x80\x99s arrest therefore did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Maryland law defines \xe2\x80\x9cpossession\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Md. Ann.

The court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the money in isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances, is mistaken in light of our precedents.
