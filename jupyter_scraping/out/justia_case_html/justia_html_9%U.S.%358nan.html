The only objection of any weight was that there was no administration upon the estate of Robert Alexander, Sr., and consequently that the possession of Chapman was not an adverse possession.</p>\n<p>But there was an executor competent to assent, and who did assent, to the legacy, and to the partition between the legatees, and who could not afterwards refuse to execute the will.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
