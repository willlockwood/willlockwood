INSURANCE CO OF NORTH AMERICA, 4 U.S. 283 (1803)</h3><b> <p> 4 U.S. 283 (Dall.) </p><p> Watson et al. <br/>v.<br/> The Insurance Company of North-America. </p><p> Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. </p></b><p><b> September Term, 1803</b> </p><p> THIS was an action on a policy of insurance, in which the declaration was for a total loss. On the trial, it appeared, that the assured had demanded payment of a total loss, which the defendants refused to pay; but there was no evidence of an actual abandonment, or offer to abandon, to the underwriters, before the suit was instituted; and the proof was of a loss in its nature total. The jury gave a verdict, in favor of the plaintiff, finding damages, as for a partial loss; subject to the opinion of the Court, upon a motion for a new trial, to consider two points reserved: 1st. Whether a previous abandonment, or offer to abandon, was indispensably necessary, to enable the plaintiff to recover in this suit? And, 2d. Whether, on a declaration for a total loss, and proof of a loss in its nature total, the jury can give damages for less than a total loss? </p><p> After argument by M. Levy and Lewis, for the plaintiffs; and by Moylan, E. Tilghman, and Ingersoll, for the defendants, the COURT ( consisting of SHIPPEN,Chief Justice, and YEATES and SMITH, Justices) were of opinion, that the jury might find damages for a partial loss; although the declaration claimed for a total loss; and although there was no proof of an actual abandonment, or an offer to abandon, to the underwriters. </p><p> But BRACKENRIDGE, Justice, said, that he thought there was sufficient evidence at the trial, to induce the jury to find an abandonment; and, on that ground alone, he concurred, in refusing a new trial. </p><p> For, the general ground, on which the opinion of the rest of the Court was founded, did not appear to him so conclusive, and so satisfactory, as it did to them. </p><p> Motion for a new trial refused: and judgment rendered on the verdict for the plaintiffs. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1948851">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> WATSON v.
