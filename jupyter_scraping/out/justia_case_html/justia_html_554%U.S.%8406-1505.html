KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY, aka KAPL, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931505.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 23, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 19, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">When the National Government ordered its contractor, respondent Knolls, to reduce its work force, Knolls had its managers score their subordinates on \xe2\x80\x9cperformance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccritical skills\xe2\x80\x9d; these scores, along with points for years of service, were used to determine who was laid off.  Of the 31 employees let go, 30 were at least 40 years old.  Petitioners (Meacham, for short) were among those laid off, and they filed this suit asserting, <em>inter alia,</em> a disparate-impact claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <em>et seq.</em>  To show such an impact, Meacham relied on a statistical expert\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that results so skewed according to age could rarely occur by chance; and that the scores for \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccriticality,\xe2\x80\x9d over which managers had the most discretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes.  The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact claim, and the Second Circuit initially affirmed.  This Court vacated the judgment and remanded in light of its intervening decision in <em>Smith</em> v. <em>City of Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/228/index.html">544 U. S. 228</a>.  The Second Circuit then held for Knolls, finding its prior ruling untenable because it had applied a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d standard rather than a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d test in assessing the employer\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on factors other than age in the layoff decisions, and because Meacham had not carried the burden of persuasion as to the reasonableness of Knolls\xe2\x80\x99s non-age factors.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0An employer defending a disparate-impact claim under the ADEA bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion for the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (RFOA) affirmative defense under \xc2\xa7623(f)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure indicate that the RFOA exemption creates an affirmative defense, for which the burden of persuasion falls on the employer.  The RFOA exemption is listed alongside one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ), which the Court has recognized to be an affirmative defense: \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall not be unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\xa6 to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) \xe2\x80\xa6 where age is a [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on [RFOA] \xe2\x80\xa6 .\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7623(f)(1).  Given that the statute lays out its exemptions in a provision separate from the general prohibitions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c), (e), and expressly refers to the prohibited conduct as such, it is no surprise that this Court has spoken of both the BFOQ and RFOA as being among the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfive affirmative defenses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thurston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/111/index.html">469 U. S. 111</a>, 122.  This reading follows the familiar principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a proviso \xe2\x80\xa6 carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Javierre</em> v. <em>Central Altagracia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/502/index.html">217 U. S. 502</a>, 508.  As this longstanding convention is part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes laws, the Court respects it unless there is compelling reason to think that Congress put the burden of persuasion on the other side.  See <em>Schaffer</em> v. <em>Weast</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/49/index.html">546 U. S. 49</a>, 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  The Court has given this principle particular weight in enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1968, <em>Corning Glass Works</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/188/index.html">417 U. S. 188</a>, 196\xe2\x80\x93197; and it has also recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ADEA [is] enforced in accordance with the \xe2\x80\x98powers, remedies, and procedures\xe2\x80\x99 of the FLSA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 580.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7623(f)(1) suggests that Congress meant it to march out of step with either the general or specifically FLSA<font b="1"> default rules placing the burden of proving an exemption on the party claiming it.  Any further doubt would be dispelled by the natural implication of the \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d language prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA defenses.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Knolls argues that because the RFOA clause bars liability where action is taken for reasons \xe2\x80\x9cother than age,\xe2\x80\x9d it should be read as mere elaboration on an element of liability.  But <em>City of Jackson</em> confirmed that \xc2\xa7623(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision.  544 U. S., at 239, 243.  And <em>City of Jackson </em>made it clear that action based on a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor other than age\xe2\x80\x9d is the very premise for disparate-impact liability, not a negation of it or a defense to it.  Thus, it is assumed that a non-age factor was at work in such a case, and the focus of the RFOA defense is on whether the factor relied on was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The business necessity test has no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases; applying both that test and the RFOA defense would entail a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.  The absence of a business necessity enquiry does not diminish, however, the reasons already given for reading the RFOA as an affirmative defense.  <em>City of Jackson</em> cannot be read as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff, for it confirmed that the BFOQ is an affirmative defense, see 544 U. S., at 233, n.\xc2\xa03.  Moreover, in referring to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Wards Cove</em>\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of identical language [in Title VII],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>City of Jackson </em>could not have had the RFOA clause in mind, for Title VII has no like-worded defense.  And as <em>Wards Cove</em> did not purport to construe any Title VII defenses, only an over-reading of <em>City of Jackson</em> would find in it an assumption that <em>Wards Cove</em> has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0<em>City of Jackson</em> confirmed that an ADEA disparate-impact plaintiff must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cisolat[e] and identif[y] the <em>specific</em> employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 241.  This is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern that recognizing an employer\xe2\x80\x99s burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court; but in the end, such concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621 <em>et seq.</em>, creates an exemption for employer actions \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by the ADEA but \xe2\x80\x9cbased on reasonable factors other than age\xe2\x80\x9d (RFOA).  \xc2\xa7623(f)(1).  The question is whether an employer facing a disparate-impact claim and planning to defend on the basis of RFOA must not only produce evidence raising the defense, but also persuade the factfinder of its merit.  We hold that the employer must do both.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The National Government pays private companies to do some of the work maintaining the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fleet of nuclear-powered warships.  One such contractor is respondent KAPL, Inc. (Knolls), the operator of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which has a history dating back to the first nuclear-powered submarines in the 1940s and 1950s.<font b="1">  The United States Navy and the Department of Energy jointly fund Knolls\xe2\x80\x99s operations, decide what projects it should pursue, and set its annual staffing limits.

Even after a hundred or so employees chose to take the company\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing buyout offer, Knolls was left with thirty-some jobs to cut.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]<font b="1">  Petitioners (Meacham, for short) are among those laid off in the resulting \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary reduction in force.\xe2\x80\x9d  In order to select those for layoff, Knolls told its managers to score their subordinates on three scales, \xe2\x80\x9cperformance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccritical skills.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The scores were summed, along with points for years of service, and the totals determined who should be let go.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of the 31 salaried employees laid off, 30 were at least 40 years old.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Twenty-eight of them sued, raising both disparate-treatment (discriminatory intent) and disparate-impact (discriminatory result) claims under the ADEA and state law, alleging that Knolls \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned and implemented its workforce reduction process to eliminate older employees and that, regardless of intent, the process had a discriminatory impact on ADEA-protected employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Meacham</em> v. <em>Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</em>, 381 F.\xc2\xa03d 56, 61 (CA2 2004) <em>(Meacham I)</em>.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, after examining the verdict through the lens of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cburden shifting\xe2\x80\x9d scheme of inference spelled out in <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/642/index.html">490 U.

The majority found its prior ruling \xe2\x80\x9cuntenable\xe2\x80\x9d because it had applied the <em>Wards Cove</em> \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d standard rather than a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d test, contrary to <em>City of Jackson</em>; and on the latter standard, Meacham, the employee, had not carried the burden of persuasion. 461 F.3d, at 140\xe2\x80\x93141, 144.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In dissent, Judge Pooler took issue with the majority for confusing business justifications<em> </em>under<em> Wards Cove</em> with the statutory RFOA exemption, which she read to be an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion falling on defendants.  461 F.3d, at 147, 149\xe2\x80\x93152.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meacham sought certiorari, noting conflicting decisions assigning the burden of persuasion on the reasonableness of the factor other than age; the Court of Appeals in this case placed it on the employee (to show the non-age factor unreasonable), but the Ninth Circuit in <em>Criswell</em> v. <em>Western Airlines, Inc.</em>, 709 F.\xc2\xa02d 544, 552 (1983), had assigned it to the employer (to show the factor was a reasonable one).

S. 158</a> (1989), and by the way Congress responded to our decision there.  In <em>Betts</em>, we said the issue was whether a provision in a former version of \xc2\xa7623(f)(2), one about employee benefit plans, merely \xe2\x80\x9credefine[d] the elements of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie<em> </em>case,\xe2\x80\x9d or instead \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed] a defense\xe2\x80\x9d to what \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise would be a violation of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 181.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Although the provision contained no \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d kind of language, we said that it \xe2\x80\x9cappears on first reading to describe an affirmative defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We nonetheless thought that this more natural view (which we had taken in <em>Thurston</em>) was overridden by evidence of legislative history, by the peculiarity of a pretext-revealing condition in the phrasing of the provision (that a benefit plan \xe2\x80\x9cnot [be] a subterfuge to evade the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of the ADEA), and by the parallel with a prior case construing an \xe2\x80\x9canalogous provision of Title VII\xe2\x80\x9d (analogous because it also contained a pretext-revealing condition).  492 U. S., at 181.  A year later, however, Congress responded to <em>Betts</em> by enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Pub. L. 101\xe2\x80\x93433, 104 Stat. 978, avowedly to \xe2\x80\x9crestore the original congressional intent\xe2\x80\x9d that the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s benefits provision be read as an affirmative defense, <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7101.  What is instructive on the question at hand is that, in clarifying that \xc2\xa7623(f)(2) specifies affirmative defenses, Congress not only set the burden in so many words but also added the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d as a part of the preface (just as in the text of \xc2\xa7623(f)(1)).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Congress thus confirmed the natural implication that we find in the \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d language in \xc2\xa7623(f)(1): it refers to an excuse or justification for behavior that, standing alone, violates the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.  The amendment in the aftermath of <em>Betts</em> shows that Congress understands the phrase the same way we naturally read it, as a clear signal that a defense to what is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d is an affirmative defense, entirely the responsibility of the party raising it.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Knolls ventures that, regardless, the RFOA provision should be read as mere elaboration on an element of liability.  Because it bars liability where action is taken for reasons \xe2\x80\x9cother than age,\xe2\x80\x9d the argument goes, the provision must be directed not at justifying age discrimination by proof of some extenuating fact but at negating the premise of liability under \xc2\xa7623(a)(2), \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of age.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer to this argument, however, is <em>City of Jackson</em>, where we confirmed that the prohibition in \xc2\xa7623(a)(2) extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision at issue here.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] <font b="1"> We drew on the recognized distinction between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact forms of liability, and explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe very definition of disparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d was that \xe2\x80\x9can employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.

We emphasized that these were the kinds of employer activities, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by \xc2\xa7623(a)(2), that were mainly what the statute meant to test against the RFOA condition: because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n disparate-impact cases \xe2\x80\xa6 the allegedly \xe2\x80\x98otherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x99 activity is not based on age,\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9cin cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a non-\nage factor that was \xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 239 (plurality opinion).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in <em>City of Jackson</em>, we made it clear that in the typical disparate-impact case, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s practice is \xe2\x80\x9cwithout respect to age\xe2\x80\x9d and its adverse impact (though \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of age\xe2\x80\x9d) is \xe2\x80\x9cattributable to a nonage factor\xe2\x80\x9d; so action based on a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor other than age\xe2\x80\x9d is the very premise for disparate-impact liability in the first place, not a negation of it or a defense to it.  The RFOA defense in a disparate-impact case, then, is not focused on the asserted fact that a non-age factor was at work; we assume it was.  The focus of the defense is that the factor relied upon was a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d one for the employer to be using.  Reasonableness is a justification categorically distinct from the factual condition \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of age\xe2\x80\x9d and not necessarily correlated with it in any particular way: a reasonable factor may lean more heavily on older workers, as against younger ones, and an unreasonable factor might do just the opposite.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals majority rejected the affirmative defense reading and arrived at its position on the burden of proof question by a different route: because it read our decision in <em>City of Jackson</em> as ruling out the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d enquiry in ADEA cases, the court concluded that the RFOA defense \xe2\x80\x9creplaces\xe2\x80\x9d it and therefore must conform to its burden of persuasion resting on the complaining party.  But the court\xe2\x80\x99s premise (that <em>City of Jackson</em> modified the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness necessity\xe2\x80\x9d enquiry) is mistaken; this alone would be reason enough to reject its approach.  And although we are now satisfied that the business necessity test should have no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases, we agree with the Government that this conclusion does not stand in the way of our holding that the RFOA exemption is an affirmative defense.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, when the Court of Appeals further inferred from the <em>City of Jackson</em> reference to <em>Wards Cove</em> that the <em>Wards Cove</em> burden of persuasion (on the employee, for the business necessity enquiry) also applied to the RFOA defense, it gave short shrift to the reasons set out in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra,</em> for reading RFOA as an affirmative defense (with the burden on the employer).  But we think that even on its own terms, <em>City of Jackson</em> falls short of supporting the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>City of Jackson</em> contains the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Wards Cove</em>\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA,\xe2\x80\x9d 544 U. S., at 240, <em>City of Jackson</em> made only two specific references to aspects of the <em>Wards Cove</em> interpretation of Title VII that might have \xe2\x80\x9cremain[ed] applicable\xe2\x80\x9d in ADEA cases.  One was to the existence of disparate-impact liability, which <em>City of Jackson</em> explained was narrower in ADEA cases than under Title VII.  The other was to a plaintiff-employee\xe2\x80\x99s burden of identifying which particular practices allegedly cause an observed disparate impact, which is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s burden<font b="1"> under both the ADEA and the pre-1991 Title VII.<font b="1">  See 544 U. S., at 241.  Neither of these references, of course, is at odds with the view of RFOA as an affirmative defense.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, indeed, <em>City of Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reference to <em>Wards Cove</em> could be read literally to include other aspects of the latter case, beyond what mattered in <em>City of Jackson</em> itself, the untoward consequences of the broader reading would rule it out.  One such consequence is embraced by Meacham, who argues both that the Court of Appeals was wrong to place the burden of<font b="1"> persuasion for the RFOA defense on the employee, and that the court was right in thinking that <em>City of Jackson</em> adopted the <em>Wards Cove</em> burden of persuasion on what Meacham views as one element of an ADEA impact claim.  For Meacham takes the position that an impact plaintiff like himself has to negate business necessity in order to show that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions were \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d; only then does the RFOA (with the burden of persuasion on the employer) have a role to play.  To apply both tests, however, would force the parties to develop (and the court or jury to follow) two overlapping enquiries: first, whether the employment practice at issue (based on a factor other than age) is supported by a business justification; and second, whether that factor is a reasonable one.  Depending on how the first enquiry proceeds, a plaintiff might directly contest the force of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, or else try to show that the employer invoked it as a pretext by pointing (for example) to alternative practices with less of a disparate impact. <font b="1"> See <em>Wards Cove</em>, 490 U. S., at 658 (\xe2\x80\x9cfirst, a consideration of the justifications an employer offers for his use of these practices; and second, the availability of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less racial\nimpact\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id</em>., at 658\xe2\x80\x93661.  But even if the\nplaintiff succeeded at one or the other, in Meacham\xe2\x80\x99s scheme the employer could still avoid liability by proving reasonableness.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here is what is so strange: as the Government says, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f disparate-impact plaintiffs have already established that a challenged practice is a pretext for intentional age discrimination, it makes little sense then to ask whether the discriminatory practice is based on reasonable factors <em>other than age</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>26 (emphasis in original).  Conversely, proving the reasonableness defense would eliminate much of the point a plaintiff would have had for showing alternatives in the first place: why make the effort to show alternative practices with a less discriminatory effect (and besides, how would that prove pretext?), when everyone knows that the choice of a practice relying on a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d non-age factor is good enough to avoid liability?[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]<font b="1">  At the very least, developing the reasonableness defense would be substantially redundant with the direct contest over the force of the business justification,<font b="1"> especially when both enquiries deal with the same, narrowly specified practice.<font b="1">  It is not very fair to take the remark about <em>Wards Cove</em> in <em>City of Jackson</em> as requiring such a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.</font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any good way to read the same line from <em>City of Jackson</em> as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff; most obviously, this would entail no longer taking the BFOQ clause to be an affirmative defense, which <em>City of Jackson</em> confirmed that it is, see 544 U. S., at 233, n.\xc2\xa03.  What is more, <em>City of Jackson</em> could not have had the RFOA clause in mind as \xe2\x80\x9cidentical\xe2\x80\x9d to anything in Title VII (for which a <em>Wards Cove</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reading might be adopted), for that statute has no like-worded defense.  And as <em>Wards Cove</em> did not purport to construe any statutory defenses under Title VII, only an over-reading of <em>City of Jackson</em> would find lurking in it an assumption that <em>Wards Cove</em> has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA (never mind one that Title VII does not have).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As mentioned, where <em>City of Jackson</em> did get help from our prior reading of Title VII was in relying on <em>Wards Cove</em> to repeat that a plaintiff falls short by merely alleging a disparate impact, or \xe2\x80\x9cpoint[ing] to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Jackson</em>, 544 U. S., at 241.  The plaintiff is obliged to do more: to \xe2\x80\x9cisolat[e] and identif[y] the <em>specific</em> employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Wards Cove</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 656; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).  The aim of this requirement, as <em>City of Jackson</em> said, is to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cresult [of] employers being potentially liable for \xe2\x80\x98the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 241 (quoting <em>Wards Cove</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 657; some internal quotation marks omitted).  And as the outcome in that case<em> </em>shows, the requirement has bite: one sufficient reason for rejecting the employees\xe2\x80\x99 challenge was that they \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue [was] relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that ha[d] an adverse impact on older workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Jackson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 241.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern raised by Knolls\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em>, who fear that recognizing an employer\xe2\x80\x99s burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense to impact claims will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court, in turn inducing employers to alter business practices in order to avoid being sued.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for General Electric Co. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18\xe2\x80\x9331.  It is also to the point that the only thing at stake in this case is the gap between production and persuasion; nobody is saying that even the burden of production should be placed on the plaintiff.  Cf. <em>Schaffer</em>, 546 U. S., at 56 (burden of persuasion answers \xe2\x80\x9cwhich party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 58 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the more plainly reasonable the employer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfactor other than age\xe2\x80\x9d is, the shorter the step for that employer from producing evidence raising the defense, to persuading the factfinder that the defense is meritorious.  It will be mainly in cases where the reasonableness of the non-age factor is obscure for some reason, that the employer will have more evidence to reveal and more convincing to do in going from production to persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That said, there is no denying that putting employers to the work of persuading factfinders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if employers merely bore the burden of production; nor do we doubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do business with their employees.  But at the end of the day, <em>amici</em>\xe2\x80\x99s concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance where it is, by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense.  We have to read it the way Congress wrote it.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said before, Congress took account of the distinctive nature of age discrimination, and the need to preserve a fair degree of leeway for employment decisions with effects that correlate with age, when it put the RFOA clause into the ADEA, \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly narrow[ing] its coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Jackson</em>, 544 U. S., at 233.  And as the outcome for the employer in <em>City of Jackson</em> shows, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 241.  In this case, we realize that the Court of Appeals showed no hesitation in finding that Knolls prevailed on the RFOA defense, though the court expressed its conclusion in terms of Meacham\xe2\x80\x99s failure to meet the burden of persuasion.  Whether the outcome should be any different when the burden is properly placed on the employer is best left to that court in the first instance.

And the second regulation would take a bit of stretching to cover disparate-impact cases, for its text speaks in terms of disparate treatment.

As represented by the Solicitor General of the United States in a brief signed by the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s General Counsel, the Commission takes the position that the reasonable-factor-other-than-age provision is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof, and that, in disparate-impact suits brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), that provision replaces the business-necessity test of <em>Wards Cove Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Atonio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/index.html">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither position was contrived just for this case.  Indeed, the Commission has arguably held its view on the burden-of-proof point for nearly 30 years.  See 44 Fed. Reg. 68858, 68861 (1979).  Although its regulation applied only to cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(e) (2007), even if that covers only disparate treatment, see <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa09, the logic of its extension to disparate-impact claims is obvious and unavoidable.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16, n.\xc2\xa01.  At the very least, the regulation does not contradict the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s current position: It does not say that the employer bears the burden of proof <em>only</em> in discriminatory-treatment cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view on the business-necessity test is newly minted, but that does not undermine it.  The Commission has never expressed the contrary view that the factfinder must consider both business necessity <em>and</em> reasonableness when an employer applies a factor that has a disparate impact on older workers.  In fact, before <em>Smith</em> v. <em>City of Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/228/index.html">544 U. S. 228</a> (2005), the Commission had not even considered the relationship between the two standards, because it used to treat the two as <em>identical</em>.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.7(d).  After <em>City of Jackson</em> rejected that equation, see 544 U. S., at 243, the Commission decided that the business-necessity standard plays no role in ADEA disparate-impact claims, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25\xe2\x80\x9327, and has even proposed new rules setting forth that position, see 73 Fed. Reg. 16807\xe2\x80\x9316809 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because administration of the ADEA has been placed in the hands of the Commission, and because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s positions on the questions before us are unquestionably reasonable (as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion ably shows), I defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views.  See <em>Raymond B. Yates, M.\xc2\xa0D., P.\xc2\xa0C. Profit Sharing Plan</em> v. <em>Hendon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1/index.html">541 U. S. 1</a>, 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

Here, although the Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden of proof on petitioners, I would nonetheless affirm because the only claims at issue are disparate-impact claims.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
