SCS CREDIT CORP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">TILL et ux. <em>v.</em> SCS CREDIT CORP.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 02\xe2\x80\x931016. Argued December 2, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 17, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Under the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccram down option\xe2\x80\x9d permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, a Chapter 13 debtor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed debt adjustment plan must provide each allowed, secured creditor both a lien securing the claim and a promise of future property disbursements whose total value, as of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s date, \xe2\x80\x9cis not less than the [claim\xe2\x80\x99s] allowed amount,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii).  When such plans provide for installment payments, each installment must be calibrated to ensure that the creditor receives disbursements whose total present value equals or exceeds that of the allowed claim.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s retail installment contract on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 truck had a secured value of $4,000 at the time petitioners filed a Chapter 13 petition.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposed debt adjustment plan provided the amount that would be distributed to creditors each month and that petitioners would pay an annual 9.5% interest rate on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s secured claim.  This \xe2\x80\x9cprime-plus\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cformula rate\xe2\x80\x9d was reached by augmenting the national prime rate of 8% to account for the nonpayment risk posed by borrowers in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 financial position.  In confirming the plan, the Bankruptcy Court overruled respondent\xe2\x80\x99s objection that it was entitled to its contract interest rate of 21%.  The District Court reversed, ruling that the 21% \xe2\x80\x9ccoerced loan rate\xe2\x80\x9d was appropriate because cram down rates must be set at the level the creditor could have obtained had it foreclosed on the loan, sold the collateral, and reinvested the proceeds in equivalent loans.  The Seventh Circuit modified that approach, holding that the original contract rate was a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptive rate\xe2\x80\x9d that could be challenged with evidence that a higher or lower rate should apply, and remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to afford the parties an opportunity to rebut the presumptive 21% rate.  The dissent proposed a \xe2\x80\x9ccost of funds rate\xe2\x80\x9d that would simply ask what it would cost the creditor to obtain the cash equivalent of the collateral from another source.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">301 F. 3d 583, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the prime-plus or formula rate best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Code gives little guidance as to which of the four interest rates advocated by opinions in this case Congress intended when it adopted the cram down provision.  A debtor\xe2\x80\x99s promise of future payments is worth less than an immediate lump sum payment because the creditor cannot use the money right away, inflation may cause the dollar\xe2\x80\x99s value to decline before the debtor pays, and there is a nonpayment risk.  In choosing an interest rate sufficient to compensate the creditor for such concerns, bankruptcy courts must consider that: (1) Congress likely intended bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the same approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate under any of the many Code provisions requiring a court to discount a stream of deferred payments back to their present dollar value; (2) Chapter 13 expressly authorizes a bankruptcy court to modify the rights of a creditor whose claim is secured by an interest in anything other than the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s principal residence; and (3) from a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, the cram down provision mandates an objective rather than a subjective inquiry.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0These considerations lead to the conclusion that the coerced loan, presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches should be rejected, since they are complicated, impose significant evidentiary costs, and aim to make each individual creditor whole rather than to ensure that a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s payments have the required present value.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The formula approach has none of these defects.  Taking its cue from ordinary lending practices, it looks to the national prime rate, which reflects the financial market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the loan\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity costs, the inflation risk, and the relatively slight default risk.  A bankruptcy court is then required to adjust the prime rate to account for the greater nonpayment risk that bankrupt debtors typically pose.  Because that adjustment depends on such factors as the estate\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, the security\xe2\x80\x99s nature, and the reorganization plan\xe2\x80\x99s duration and feasibility, the court must hold a hearing to permit the debtor and creditors to present evidence about the appropriate risk adjustment.  Unlike the other approaches proposed in this case, the formula approach entails a straightforward, familiar, and objective inquiry, and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional evidentiary hearings.  The resulting prime-plus rate also depends only on the state of financial markets, the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, and the loan\xe2\x80\x99s characteristics, not on the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances or its prior interactions with the debtor.  The risk adjustment\xe2\x80\x99s proper scale is not before this Court.  The Bankruptcy Court approved 1.5% in this case, and other courts have generally approved 1% to 3%, but respondent claims a risk adjustment in this range is inadequate.  The issue need not be resolved here; it is sufficient to note that courts must choose a rate high enough to compensate a creditor for its risk but not so high as to doom the bankruptcy plan.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas concluded that the proposed 9.5% rate will sufficiently compensate respondent for the fact that it is receiving monthly payments rather than a lump sum payment, but that 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not require that the proper interest rate reflect the risk of nonpayment.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The plain language of \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires a court to determine, first, the allowed amount of the claim; second, what is the property to be distributed under the plan; and third, the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, as of the effective date of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d of the property to be distributed.  This third requirement, which is at issue here, incorporates the principle of the time value of money.  Section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires valuation of the <em>property</em>, not valuation of the <em>plan</em>.  Thus, a plan need only propose an interest rate that will compensate a creditor for the fact that had he received the property immediately rather than at a future date, he could have immediately made use of the property.  In most, if not all, cases, where the plan proposes simply a stream of cash payments, the appropriate risk-free rate should suffice.  There may be some risk of nonpayment, but \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not take this risk into account.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) was crafted to protect creditors rather than debtors ignores the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language and overlooks the fact that secured creditors are compensated in part for the nonpayment risk through the valuation of the secured claim.  Further, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language is by no means debtor protective.  Given the presence of multiple creditor-specific protections, it is not irrational to assume that Congress opted not to provide further protection for creditors by requiring a debtor-specific risk adjustment under \xc2\xa71325(a)(5).  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Here, the allowed amount of the secured claim is $4,000, and the property to be distributed under the plan is cash payments.  Because the proposed 9.5% interest rate is higher than the risk-free rate, it is sufficient to account for the time value of money, which is all the statute requires.

The proceedings in this case that led to our grant of certiorari identified four different methods of determining the appropriate method with which to perform that calibration.  Indeed, the Bankruptcy Judge, the District Court, the Court of Appeals majority, and the dissenting Judge each endorsed a different approach.  We detail the underlying facts and describe each of those approaches before setting forth our judgment as to which approach best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 2, 1998, petitioners Lee and Amy Till, residents of Kokomo, Indiana, purchased a used truck from Instant Auto Finance for $6,395 plus $330.75 in fees and taxes.  They made a $300 down payment and financed the balance of the purchase price by entering into a retail installment contract that Instant Auto immediately assigned to respondent, SCS Credit Corporation.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 initial indebtedness amounted to $8,285.24\xe2\x80\x94the $6,425.75 balance of the truck purchase plus a finance charge of 21% per year for 136 weeks, or $1,859.49.  Under the contract, petitioners agreed to make 68 biweekly payments to cover this debt; Instant Auto\xe2\x80\x94and subsequently respondent\xe2\x80\x94retained a purchase money security interest that gave it the right to repossess the truck if petitioners defaulted under the contract.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 25, 1999, petitioners, by then in default on their payments to respondent, filed a joint petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  At the time of the filing, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding claim amounted to $4,894.89, but the parties agreed that the truck securing the claim was worth only $4,000.  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  In accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, therefore, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s secured claim was limited to $4,000, and the $894.89 balance was unsecured.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 filing automatically stayed debt-collection activity by their various creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), respondent, three other holders of secured claims, and unidentified unsecured creditors.  In addition, the filing created a bankruptcy estate, administered by a trustee, which consisted of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 property, including the truck.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposed debt adjustment plan called for them to submit their future earnings to the supervision and control of the Bankruptcy Court for three years, and to assign $740 of their wages to the trustee each month.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a\xe2\x80\x9381a.  The plan charged the trustee with distributing these monthly wage assignments to pay, in order of priority: (1) administrative costs; (2) the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s priority tax claim; (3) secured creditors\xe2\x80\x99 claims; and finally, (4) unsecured creditors\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 77a\xe2\x80\x9379a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proposed plan also provided that petitioners would pay interest on the secured portion of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim at a rate of 9.5% per year.  Petitioners arrived at this \xe2\x80\x9cprime-plus\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cformula rate\xe2\x80\x9d by augmenting the national prime rate of approximately 8% (applied by banks when making low-risk loans) to account for the risk of nonpayment posed by borrowers in their financial position.  Respondent objected to the proposed rate, contending that the company was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to interest at the rate of 21%, which is the rate \xe2\x80\xa6 it would obtain if it could foreclose on the vehicle and reinvest the proceeds in loans of equivalent duration and risk as the loan\xe2\x80\x9d originally made to petitioners.  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the hearing on its objection, respondent presented expert testimony establishing that it uniformly charges 21% interest on so-called \xe2\x80\x9csubprime\xe2\x80\x9d loans, or loans to borrowers with poor credit ratings, and that other lenders in the subprime market also charge that rate.  Petitioners countered with the testimony of an Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis economics professor, who acknowledged that he had only limited familiarity with the subprime auto lending market, but described the 9.5% formula rate as \xe2\x80\x9cvery reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d given that Chapter 13 plans are \xe2\x80\x9csupposed to be financially feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  Moreover, the professor noted that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s exposure was \xe2\x80\x9cfairly limited because [petitioners] are under the supervision of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.  The bankruptcy trustee also filed comments supporting the formula rate as, among other things, easily ascertainable, closely tied to the \xe2\x80\x9ccondition of the financial market,\xe2\x80\x9d and independent of the financial circumstances of any particular lender.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a\xe2\x80\x9342a.  Accepting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence, the Bankruptcy Court overruled respondent\xe2\x80\x99s objection and confirmed the proposed plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court reversed.  It understood Seventh Circuit precedent to require that bankruptcy courts set cram down interest rates at the level the creditor could have obtained if it had foreclosed on the loan, sold the collateral, and reinvested the proceeds in loans of equivalent duration and risk.  Citing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s unrebutted testimony about the market for subprime loans, the court concluded that 21% was the appropriate rate.  <em>Id</em>., at 38a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Seventh Circuit endorsed a slightly modified version of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccoerced\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cforced loan\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Till</em>, 301 F.\xc2\xa03d 583, 591 (2002).  Specifically, the majority agreed with the District Court that, in a cram down proceeding, the inquiry should focus on the interest rate \xe2\x80\x9cthat the creditor in question would obtain in making a new loan in the same industry to a debtor who is similarly situated, although not in bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 592.  To approximate that new loan rate, the majority looked to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 prebankruptcy contract rate (21%).  The court recognized, however, that using the contract rate would not \xe2\x80\x9cduplicat[e] precisely \xe2\x80\xa6 the present value of the collateral to the creditor\xe2\x80\x9d because loans to bankrupt, court-supervised debtors \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve some risks that would not be incurred in a new loan to a debtor not in default\xe2\x80\x9d and also produce \xe2\x80\x9csome economies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  To correct for these inaccuracies, the majority held that the original contract rate should \xe2\x80\x9cserve as a presumptive [cram down] rate,\xe2\x80\x9d which either the creditor or the debtor could challenge with evidence that a higher or lower rate should apply.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to afford petitioners and respondent an opportunity to rebut the presumptive 21% rate.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dissenting, Judge Rovner argued that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s presumptive contract rate approach overcompensates secured creditors because it fails to account for costs a creditor would have to incur in issuing a new loan.  Rather than focusing on the market for comparable loans, Judge Rovner advocated either the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s formula approach or a \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward \xe2\x80\xa6 cost of funds\xe2\x80\x9d approach that would simply ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it would cost the creditor to obtain the cash equivalent of the collateral from an alternative source.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 595\xe2\x80\x93596.  Although Judge Rovner noted that the rates produced by either the formula or the cost of funds approach might be \xe2\x80\x9cpiddling\xe2\x80\x9d relative to the coerced loan rate, she suggested courts should \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the extent to which the creditor has already been compensated for \xe2\x80\xa6 the risk that the debtor will be unable to discharge his obligations under the reorganization plan \xe2\x80\xa6 in the rate of interest that it charged to the debtor in return for the original loan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 596.  We granted certiorari and now reverse.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/925/index.html">539 U. S. 925</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Code provides little guidance as to which of the rates of interest advocated by the four opinions in this case\xe2\x80\x94the formula rate, the coerced loan rate, the presumptive contract rate, or the cost of funds rate\xe2\x80\x94Congress had in mind when it adopted the cram down provision.  That provision, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B), does not mention the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscount rate\xe2\x80\x9d or the word \xe2\x80\x9cinterest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it simply requires bankruptcy courts to ensure that the property to be distributed to a particular secured creditor over the life of a bankruptcy plan has a total \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, as of the effective date of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d that equals or exceeds the value of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s allowed secured claim\xe2\x80\x94in this case, $4,000.  \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That command is easily satisfied when the plan provides for a lump-sum payment to the creditor.  Matters are not so simple, however, when the debt is to be discharged by a series of payments over time.  A debtor\xe2\x80\x99s promise of future payments is worth less than an immediate payment of the same total amount because the creditor cannot use the money right away, inflation may cause the value of the dollar to decline before the debtor pays, and there is always some risk of nonpayment.  The challenge for bankruptcy courts reviewing such repayment schemes, therefore, is to choose an interest rate sufficient to compensate the creditor for these concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three important considerations govern that choice.  First, the Bankruptcy Code includes numerous provisions that, like the cram down provision, require a court to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscoun[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 [a] stream of deferred payments back to the[ir] present dollar value,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rake</em> v. <em>Wade,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/464/index.html"></a><a href="/us/508/464/index.html">508 U. S. 464</a>, 472, n. 8 (1993), to ensure that a creditor receives at least the value of its claim.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We think it likely that Congress intended bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the same approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate under any of these provisions.  Moreover, we think Congress would favor an approach that is familiar in the financial community and that minimizes the need for expensive evidentiary proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Chapter 13 expressly authorizes a bankruptcy court to modify the rights of any creditor whose claim is secured by an interest in anything other than \xe2\x80\x9creal property that is the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s principal residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71322(b)(2).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, in cases like this involving secured interests in personal property, the court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to modify the number, timing, or amount of the installment payments from those set forth in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s original contract is perfectly clear.  Further, the potential need to modify the loan terms to account for intervening changes in circumstances is also clear: On the one hand, the fact of the bankruptcy establishes that the debtor is overextended and thus poses a significant risk of default; on the other hand, the postbankruptcy obligor is no longer the individual debtor but the court-supervised estate, and the risk of default is thus somewhat reduced.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, from the point of view of a creditor, the cram down provision mandates an objective rather than a subjective inquiry.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  That is, although \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B) entitles the creditor to property whose present value objectively equals or exceeds the value of the collateral, it does not require that the terms of the cram down loan match the terms to which the debtor and creditor agreed prebankruptcy, nor does it require that the cram down terms make the creditor subjectively indifferent between present foreclosure and future payment.  Indeed, the very idea of a \xe2\x80\x9ccram down\xe2\x80\x9d loan <em>precludes</em> the latter result: By definition, a creditor forced to accept such a loan would prefer instead to foreclose.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, a court choosing a cram down interest rate need not consider the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s individual circumstances, such as its prebankruptcy dealings with the debtor or the alternative loans it could make if permitted to foreclose.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Rather, the court should aim to treat similarly situated creditors similarly,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and to ensure that an objective economic analysis would suggest the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest payments will adequately compensate all such creditors for the time value of their money and the risk of default.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations lead us to reject the coerced loan, presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches.  Each of these approaches is complicated, imposes significant evidentiary costs, and aims to make each individual creditor whole rather than to ensure the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s payments have the required present value.  For example, the coerced loan approach requires bankruptcy courts to consider evidence about the market for comparable loans to similar (though nonbankrupt) debtors\xe2\x80\x94an inquiry far removed from such courts\xe2\x80\x99 usual task of evaluating debtors\xe2\x80\x99 financial circumstances and the feasibility of their debt adjustment plans.  In addition, the approach overcompensates creditors because the market lending rate must be high enough to cover factors, like lenders\xe2\x80\x99 transaction costs and overall profits, that are no longer relevant in the context of court&amp;nbhyph;administered and court&amp;nbhyph;supervised cram down loans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the coerced loan approach, the presumptive contract rate approach improperly focuses on the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s potential use of the proceeds of a foreclosure sale.  In addition, although the approach permits a debtor to introduce some evidence about each creditor, thereby enabling the court to tailor the interest rate more closely to the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s financial circumstances and reducing the likelihood that the creditor will be substantially overcompensated, that right comes at a cost: The debtor must obtain information about the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s costs of overhead, financial circumstances, and lending practices to rebut the presumptive contract rate.  Also, the approach produces absurd results, entitling \xe2\x80\x9cinefficient, poorly managed lenders\xe2\x80\x9d with lower profit margins to obtain higher cram down rates than \xe2\x80\x9cwell managed, better capitalized lenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \xc2\xa7112.1, p. 112\xe2\x80\x938 (3d ed. 2000).  Finally, because the approach relies heavily on a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s prior dealings with the debtor, similarly situated creditors may end up with vastly different cram down rates.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cost of funds approach, too, is improperly aimed.  Although it rightly disregards the now-irrelevant terms of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 original contract, it mistakenly focuses on the creditworthiness of the <em>creditor</em> rather than the debtor.  In addition, the approach has many of the other flaws of the coerced loan and presumptive contract rate approaches.  For example, like the presumptive contract rate approach, the cost of funds approach imposes a significant evidentiary burden, as a debtor seeking to rebut a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s asserted cost of borrowing must introduce expert testimony about the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition.  Also, under this approach, a creditworthy lender with a low cost of borrowing may obtain a lower cram down rate than a financially unsound, fly-by-night lender.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The formula approach has none of these defects.  Taking its cue from ordinary lending practices, the approach begins by looking to the national prime rate, reported daily in the press, which reflects the financial market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the opportunity costs of the loan, the risk of inflation, and the relatively slight risk of default.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Because bankrupt debtors typically pose a greater risk of nonpayment than solvent commercial borrowers, the approach then requires a bankruptcy court to adjust the prime rate accordingly.  The appropriate size of that risk adjustment depends, of course, on such factors as the circumstances of the estate, the nature of the security, and the duration and feasibility of the reorganization plan.  The court must therefore hold a hearing at which the debtor and any creditors may present evidence about the appropriate risk adjustment.  Some of this evidence will be included in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy filings, however, so the debtor and creditors may not incur significant additional expense.  Moreover, starting from a concededly <em>low</em> estimate and adjusting <em>upward</em> places the evidentiary burden squarely on the creditors, who are likely to have readier access to any information absent from the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s filing (such as evidence about the \xe2\x80\x9cliquidity of the collateral market,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 9 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  Finally, many of the factors relevant to the adjustment fall squarely within the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s area of expertise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, unlike the coerced loan, presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches, the formula approach entails a straightforward, familiar, and objective inquiry, and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional evidentiary proceedings.  Moreover, the resulting \xe2\x80\x9cprime-plus\xe2\x80\x9d rate of interest depends only on the state of financial markets, the circumstances of the bankruptcy estate, and the characteristics of the loan, not on the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances or its prior interactions with the debtor.  For these reasons, the prime-plus or formula rate best comports with the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not decide the proper scale for the risk adjustment, as the issue is not before us.  The Bankruptcy Court in this case approved a risk adjustment of 1.5%, App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a\xe2\x80\x9373a, and other courts have generally approved adjustments of 1% to 3%, see <em>In\xc2\xa0re Valenti</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa03d 55, 64 (CA2) (collecting cases), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Associates Commercial Corp.</em> v. <em>Rash,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/953/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/953/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/953/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/953/index.html">520 U. S. 953</a> (1997).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s core argument is that a risk adjustment in this range is entirely inadequate to compensate a creditor for the real risk that the plan will fail.  There is some dispute about the true scale of that risk\xe2\x80\x94respondent claims that more than 60% of Chapter 13 plans fail, Brief for Respondent 25, but petitioners argue that the failure rate for <em>approved</em> Chapter 13 plans is much lower, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  We need not resolve that dispute.  It is sufficient for our purposes to note that, under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(6), a court may not approve a plan unless, after considering all creditors\xe2\x80\x99 objections and receiving the advice of the trustee, the judge is persuaded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Together with the cram down provision, this requirement obligates the court to select a rate high enough to compensate the creditor for its risk but not so high as to doom the plan.  If the court determines that the likelihood of default is so high as to necessitate an \xe2\x80\x9ceye-popping\xe2\x80\x9d interest rate, 301 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 593 (Rovner, J., dissenting), the plan probably should not be confirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of the presumptive contract rate approach rests on two assumptions: (1) \xe2\x80\x9csubprime lending markets are competitive and therefore largely efficient\xe2\x80\x9d; and (2) the risk of default in Chapter 13 is normally no less than the risk of default at the time of the original loan.  <em>Post</em>, at 2.  Although the Bankruptcy Code provides little guidance on the question, we think it highly unlikely that Congress would endorse either premise.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the dissent assumes that subprime loans are negotiated between fully informed buyers and sellers in a classic free market.  But there is no basis for concluding that Congress relied on this assumption when it enacted Chapter 13.  Moreover, several considerations suggest that the subprime market is not, in fact, perfectly competitive.  To begin with, used vehicles are regularly sold by means of tie-in transactions, in which the price of the vehicle is the subject of negotiation, while the terms of the financing are dictated by the seller.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  In addition, there is extensive federal[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] and state[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] regulation of subprime lending, which not only itself distorts the market, but also evinces regulators\xe2\x80\x99 belief that unregulated subprime lenders would exploit borrowers\xe2\x80\x99 ignorance and charge rates above what a competitive market would allow.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Indeed, Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act in part because it believed \xe2\x80\x9cconsumers would individually benefit not only from the more informed use of credit, but also from heightened competition which would result from more knowledgeable credit shopping.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x93368, p.\xc2\xa016 (1979).[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the dissent apparently believes that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prebankruptcy default\xe2\x80\x94on a loan made in a market in which creditors commonly charge the maximum rate of interest allowed by law, Brief for Respondent 16, and in which neither creditors nor debtors have the protections afforded by Chapter 13\xe2\x80\x94translates into a high probability that the same debtor\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed Chapter 13 plan will fail.  In our view, however, Congress intended to create a program under which plans that qualify for confirmation have a high probability of success.  Perhaps bankruptcy judges currently confirm too many risky plans, but the solution is to confirm fewer such plans, not to set default cram down rates at absurdly high levels, thereby increasing the risk of default.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, as Justice Thomas demonstrates, <em>post</em>, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment), the text of \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) may be read to support the conclusion that Congress did not intend the cram down rate to include <em>any</em> compensation for the risk of default.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  That reading is consistent with a view that Congress believed Chapter 13\xe2\x80\x99s protections to be so effective as to make the risk of default negligible.  Because our decision in <em>Rash</em> assumes that cram down interest rates are adjusted to \xe2\x80\x9coffset,\xe2\x80\x9d to the extent possible, the risk of default, 520 U. S., at 962\xe2\x80\x93963, and because so many judges who have considered the issue (including the authors of the four earlier opinions in this case) have rejected the risk-free approach, we think it too late in the day to endorse that approach now.  Of course, if the text of the statute required such an approach, that would be the end of the matter.  We think, however, that \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan\xe2\x80\x9d is better read to incorporate all of the commonly understood components of \xe2\x80\x9cpresent value,\xe2\x80\x9d including any risk of nonpayment.  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 reading does emphasize, though, that a presumption that bankruptcy plans will succeed is more consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statutory scheme than the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s more cynical focus on bankrupt debtors\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial instability and \xe2\x80\xa6 proclivity to seek legal protection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s two assumptions do not necessarily favor the presumptive contract rate approach.  For one thing, the cram down provision applies not only to subprime loans but also to prime loans negotiated prior to the change in circumstance (job loss, for example) that rendered the debtor insolvent.  Relatedly, the provision also applies in instances in which national or local economic conditions drastically improved or declined after the original loan was issued but before the debtor filed for bankruptcy.  In either case, there is every reason to think that a properly risk-adjusted prime rate will provide a better estimate of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s current costs and exposure than a contract rate set in different times.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even more important, if all relevant information about the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, the nature of the collateral, and the market for comparable loans were equally available to both debtor and creditor, then in theory the formula and presumptive contract rate approaches would yield the same final interest rate.  Thus, we principally differ with the dissent not over what final rate courts should adopt but over which party (creditor or debtor) should bear the burden of rebutting the presumptive rate (prime or contract, respectively).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia identifies four \xe2\x80\x9crelevant factors bearing on risk premium[:] (1) the probability of plan failure; (2) the rate of collateral depreciation; (3) the liquidity of the collateral market; and (4) the administrative expenses of enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 9.  In our view, any information debtors have about any of these factors is likely to be included in their bankruptcy filings, while the remaining information will be far more accessible to creditors (who must collect information about their lending markets to remain competitive) than to individual debtors (whose only experience with those markets might be the single loan at issue in the case).  Thus, the formula approach, which begins with a concededly low estimate of the appropriate interest rate and requires the creditor to present evidence supporting a higher rate, places the evidentiary burden on the more knowledgeable party, thereby facilitating more accurate calculation of the appropriate interest rate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the rather sketchy data uncovered by the dissent support an argument that Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code should mandate application of the presumptive contract rate approach (rather than merely an argument that bankruptcy judges should exercise greater caution before approving debt adjustment plans), those data should be forwarded to Congress.  We are not persuaded, however, that the data undermine our interpretation of the statutory scheme Congress has enacted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to remand the case to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa011 U.

First, as noted below, <em>infra</em>, at 14, a court may only approve a cram down loan (and the debt adjustment plan of which the loan is a part) if it believes the debtor will be able to make all of the required payments.  \xc2\xa71325(a)(6).  Thus, such loans will only be approved for debtors that the court deems creditworthy.

Third, the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s extensive disclosure requirements reduce the risk that the debtor has significant undisclosed obligations.  Fourth, as a practical matter, the public nature of the bankruptcy proceeding is likely to reduce the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities to take on additional debt.  Cf.\n11  U.

Thus, when picking a cram down rate in a Chapter 11 case, it might make sense to ask what rate an efficient market would produce.

If a market prices the cost of goods and the cost of financing together, then even if that market is perfectly competitive, all we can know is that the <em>combined</em> price of the goods and the financing is competitive and efficient.  We have no way of determining whether the allocation of that price between goods and financing would be the same if the two components were separately negotiated.

Both the plurality and the dissent agree that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] debtor\xe2\x80\x99s promise of future payments is worth less than an immediate payment of the same total amount because the creditor cannot use the money right away, inflation may cause the value of the dollar to decline before the debtor pays, and there is always some risk of nonpayment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7; <em>post, </em>at 1.  Thus, the plurality and the dissent agree that the proper method for discounting deferred payments to present value should take into account each of these factors, but disagree over the proper starting point for calculating the risk of nonpayment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree that a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>promise</em> of future payments is worth less than an immediate payment\xe2\x80\x9d of the same amount, in part because of the risk of nonpayment.  But this fact is irrelevant.  The statute does not require that the value of the <em>promise</em> to distribute property under the plan be no less than the allowed amount of the secured creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  It requires only that \xe2\x80\x9cthe value \xe2\x80\xa6 of <em>property</em> to be distributed under the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the effective date of the plan, be no less than the amount of the secured creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Both the plurality and the dissent ignore the clear text of the statute in an apparent rush to ensure that secured creditors are not undercompensated in bankruptcy proceedings.  But the statute that Congress enacted does not require a debtor-specific risk adjustment that would put secured creditors in the same position as if they had made another loan.  It is for this reason that I write separately.  </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well established that \xe2\x80\x98when the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain, the sole function of the courts\xe2\x80\x94at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\xe2\x80\x94is to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee,</em> 540 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937) (quoting <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/1/index.html">530 U.

Section 1325(a)(5)(B) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim [must] not [be] less than the allowed amount of such claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the statute requires a bankruptcy court to make at least three separate determinations.  First, a court must determine the allowed amount of the claim.  Second, a court must determine what is the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Third, a court must determine the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, as of the effective date of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d of the property to be distributed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispute in this case centers on the proper method to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  The requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d of the property to be distributed be determined \xe2\x80\x9cas of the effective date of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates the principle of the time value of money.  To put it simply, $4,000 today is worth more than $4,000 to be received 17 months from today because if received today, the $4,000 can be invested to start earning interest immediately.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See Encyclopedia of Banking &amp; Finance 1015 (9th ed. 1991).  Thus, as we explained in <em>Rake</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/464/index.html">508 U. S. 464</a> (1993), \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a claim is paid off pursuant to a stream of future payments, a creditor receives the \xe2\x80\x98present value\xe2\x80\x99 of its claim only if the total amount of the deferred payments includes the amount of the underlying claim plus an appropriate amount of interest to compensate the creditor for the decreased value of the claim caused by the delayed payments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 472, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues, and the plurality and the dissent agree, that the proper interest rate must also reflect the risk of nonpayment.  But the statute contains no such requirement.  The statute only requires the valuation of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed,\xe2\x80\x9d not the valuation of the plan (<em>i.e.,</em> the promise to make the payments itself).  Thus, in order for a plan to satisfy \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii), the plan need only propose an interest rate that will compensate a creditor for the fact that if he had received the property immediately rather than at a future date, he could have immediately made use of the property.  In most, if not all, cases, where the plan proposes simply a stream of cash payments, the appropriate risk-free rate should suffice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent here would certainly be acutely aware of any risk of default inherent in a Chapter 13 plan, but it is nonsensical to speak of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s risk of default being inherent in the value of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d unless that property is a promise or a debt.  Suppose, for instance, that it is currently time A, the property to be distributed is a house, and it will be distributed at time B.  Although market conditions might cause the value of the house to fluctuate between time A and time B, the fluctuating value of the house itself has nothing to do with the risk that the debtor will not deliver the house at time B.  The value of the house, then, can be and is determined entirely without any reference to any possibility that a promise to transfer the house would not be honored.  So too, then, with cash: the value of the cash can be and is determined without any inclusion of any risk that the debtor will fail to transfer the cash at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent might be correct that the use of the prime rate,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] even with a small risk adjustment, \xe2\x80\x9cwill systematically undercompensate secured creditors for the true risks of default.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This systematic undercompensation might seem problematic as a matter of policy.  But, it raises no problem as a matter of statutory interpretation.  Thus, although there is always some risk of nonpayment when A promises to repay a debt to B through a stream of payments over time rather than through an immediate lump sum payment, \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not take this risk into account.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s risk of nonpayment can never be a factor in determining the value of the property to be distributed.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, nothing in \xc2\xa71325 suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d is limited to cash.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99 can be cash, notes, stock, personal property or real property; in short, anything of value.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6  ;1129.03[7][b][i], p. 1129\xe2\x80\x9344 (15th ed. 2003) (discussing Chapter 11\xe2\x80\x99s cram down provision).  And if the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d under a Chapter 13 plan is a note (<em>i.e.,</em> a promise to pay), for instance, the value of that note necessarily includes the risk that the debtor will not make good on that promise.  Still, accounting for the risk of nonpayment in that case is not equivalent to reading a risk adjustment requirement into the statute, as in the case of a note, the risk of nonpayment is part of the value of the note itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress crafted the requirements of section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) for the protection of <em>creditors</em>, not debtors,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus that the relevant interest rate must account for the true risks and costs associated with a Chapter 13 debtor\xe2\x80\x99s promise of future payment.  Brief for Respondent 24 (citing <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Home State Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/78/index.html">501 U. S. 78</a>, 87\xe2\x80\x9388 (1991)).  In addition to ignoring the plain language of the statute, which requires no such risk adjustment, respondent overlooks the fact that secured creditors are already compensated in part for the risk of nonpayment through the valuation of the secured claim.  In <em>Associates Commercial Corp.</em> v. <em>Rash,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/953/index.html">520 U. S. 953</a> (1997), we utilized a secured-creditor-friendly replacement-value standard rather than the lower foreclosure-value standard for valuing secured claims when a debtor has exercised Chapter 13\xe2\x80\x99s cram down option.  We did so because the statute at issue in that case reflected Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a debtor keeps the property and continues to use it, the creditor obtains at once neither the property nor its value and is exposed to double risks:  The debtor may again default and the property may deteriorate from extended use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 962.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the plain language of the statute is by no means specifically debtor protective.  As the Court pointed out in <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 87\xe2\x80\x9388, \xc2\xa71325 contains a number of provisions to protect creditors: A bankruptcy court can only authorize a plan that \xe2\x80\x9chas been proposed in good faith,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71325(a)(3); secured creditors must accept the plan, obtain the property securing the claim, or \xe2\x80\x9cretain the[ir] lien[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and receive under the plan distributions of property which equal \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than the allowed amount of such claim,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71325(a)(5); and a bankruptcy court must ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthe debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71325(a)(6).  Given the presence of multiple creditor-specific protections, it is by no means irrational to assume that Congress opted not to provide further protection for creditors by requiring a debtor-specific risk adjustment under \xc2\xa71325(a)(5).  Although the dissent may feel that this is insufficient compensation for secured creditors, given the apparent rate at which debtors fail to complete their Chapter 13 plans, see <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 and n.\xc2\xa01, this is a matter that should be brought to the attention of Congress rather than resolved by this Court.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The allowed amount of the secured claim is $4,000.  App. 57.  The statute then requires a bankruptcy court to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d under the plan.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Amended Chapter 13 Plan (Plan) provided:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe future earnings of DEBTOR(S) are submitted to the supervision and control of this Court, and DEBTOR(S) shall pay to the TRUSTEE a sum of $740 per month in weekly installments by voluntary wage assignment by separate ORDER of the Court in an estimated amount of $170.77 and continuing for a total plan term of 36 months unless this Court approves an extension of the term not beyond 60 months from the date of filing the Petition herein.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nFrom the payments received, the trustee would then make disbursements to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 creditors, pro\xc2\xa0rata among each class of creditors.  The Plan listed one priority claim and four secured claims.  For respondent\xe2\x80\x99s secured claim, petitioner proposed an interest rate of 9.5%.  App. 57.  Thus, petitioners proposed to distribute to respondent a stream of cash payments equaling respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pro\xc2\xa0rata share of $740 per month for a period of up to 36 months.  App. 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Plan does not specifically state that \xe2\x80\x9cthe property to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d under the Plan is cash payments, the cash payments are the only \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d specifically listed for distribution under the Plan.  Thus, although the plurality and the dissent imply that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d under the Plan is the mere <em>promise</em> to make cash payments, the plain language of the Plan indicates that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d to respondent is up to 36 monthly cash payments, consisting of a pro\xc2\xa0rata share of $740 per month.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final task, then, is to determine whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposed 9.5% interest rate will sufficiently compensate respondent for the fact that instead of receiving $4,000 today, it will receive $4,000 plus 9.5% interest over a period of up to 36 months.  Because the 9.5% rate is higher than the risk-free rate, I conclude that it will.

The plurality would use the prime lending rate\xe2\x80\x94\na rate we <em>know</em> is too low\xe2\x80\x94and require the judge in every case to determine an amount by which to increase it.  I believe that, in practice, this approach will systematically undercompensate secured creditors for the true risks of default.  I would instead adopt the contract rate\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the rate at which the creditor actually loaned funds to the debtor\xe2\x80\x94as a presumption that the bankruptcy judge could revise on motion of either party.  Since that rate is generally a good indicator of actual risk, disputes should be infrequent, and it will provide a quick and reasonably accurate standard.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contract-rate approach makes two assumptions, both of which are reasonable.  First, it assumes that subprime lending markets are competitive and therefore largely efficient.  If so, the high interest rates lenders charge reflect not extortionate profits or excessive costs, but the actual risks of default that subprime borrowers present.  Lenders with excessive rates would be undercut by their competitors, and inefficient ones would be priced out of the market.  We have implicitly assumed market competitiveness in other bankruptcy contexts.  See <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn.</em> v. <em>203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/434/index.html">526 U. S. 434</a>, 456\xe2\x80\x93458 (1999).  Here the assumption is borne out by empirical evidence: One study reports that subprime lenders are nearly twice as likely to be unprofitable as banks, suggesting a fiercely competitive environment.  See J. Lane, Associate Director, Division of Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, A Regulator\xe2\x80\x99s View of Subprime Lending: Address at the National Automotive Finance Association Non-Prime Auto Lending Conference 6 (June 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 2002) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  By relying on the prime rate, the plurality implicitly assumes that the <em>prime</em> lending market is efficient, see <em>ante</em>, at 12; I see no reason not to make a similar assumption about the <em>sub</em>prime lending market.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second assumption is that the expected costs of default in Chapter 13 are normally no less than those at the time of lending.  This assumption is also reasonable.  Chapter 13 plans often fail.  I agree with petitioners that the relevant statistic is the percentage of <em>confirmed </em>plans that fail, but even resolving that issue in their favor, the risk is still substantial.  The failure rate they offer\xe2\x80\x94which we may take to be a conservative estimate, as it is doubtless the lowest one they could find\xe2\x80\x94is 37%.  See Girth, The Role of Empirical Data in Developing Bankruptcy Legislation for Individuals, 65 Ind. L.\xc2\xa0J. 17, 40\xe2\x80\x9342 (1989) (reporting a 63.1% success rate).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In every one of the failed plans making up that 37%, a bankruptcy judge had found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(6), and a trustee had supervised the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s compliance, \xc2\xa71302.  That so many nonetheless failed proves that bankruptcy judges are not oracles and that trustees cannot draw blood from a stone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While court and trustee oversight may provide some marginal benefit to the creditor, it seems obviously outweighed by the fact that (1) an already-bankrupt borrower has demonstrated a financial instability and a proclivity to seek legal protection that other subprime borrowers have not, and (2) the costs of foreclosure are substantially higher in bankruptcy because the automatic stay bars repossession without judicial permission.  See \xc2\xa7362.  It does not strike me as plausible that creditors would <em>prefer </em>to lend to individuals already in bankruptcy than to those for whom bankruptcy is merely a possibility\xe2\x80\x94as if Chapter 13 were widely viewed by secured creditors as some sort of godsend.  Cf. Dunagan, Enforcement of Security Interests in Motor Vehicles in Bankruptcy, 52 Consumer Fin. L.\xc2\xa0Q. Rep. 191, 197 (1998).  Certainly the record in this case contradicts that implausible proposition.  See App. 48 (testimony of Craig Cook, sales manager of Instant Auto Finance) (\xe2\x80\x9cQ. Are you aware of how other lenders similar to Instant Auto Finance view credit applicants who appear to be candidates for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cA. Negative[ly] as well\xe2\x80\x9d).  The better assumption is that bankrupt debtors are riskier than other subprime debtors\xe2\x80\x94or, at the very least, not systematically <em>less </em>risky.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first of the two assumptions means that the contract rate reasonably reflects actual risk at the time of borrowing.  The second means that this risk persists when the debtor files for Chapter 13.  It follows that the contract rate is a decent estimate, or at least the lower bound, for the appropriate interest rate in cramdown.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality disputes these two assumptions.  It argues that subprime lending markets are not competitive because \xe2\x80\x9cvehicles are regularly sold by means of tie-in transactions, in which the price of the vehicle is the subject of negotiation, while the terms of the financing are dictated by the seller.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Tie-ins do not <em>alone </em>make financing markets noncompetitive; they only cause prices and interest rates to be considered <em>in tandem</em> rather than separately.  The force of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument depends entirely on its claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the financing are dictated by the seller.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This unsubstantiated assertion is contrary to common experience.  Car sellers routinely advertise their interest rates, offer promotions like \xe2\x80\x9czero-percent financing,\xe2\x80\x9d and engage in other behavior that plainly assumes customers are sensitive to interest rates and not just price.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality also points to state and federal regulation of lending markets.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  It claims that state usury laws evince a belief that subprime lending markets are noncompetitive.  While that is one <em>conceivable </em>explanation for such laws, there are countless others.  One statistical and historical study suggests that usury laws are a \xe2\x80\x9cprimitive means of social insurance\xe2\x80\x9d meant to ensure \xe2\x80\x9clow interest rates\xe2\x80\x9d for those who suffer financial adversity.  Glaeser &amp; Scheinkman, Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be: An Economic Analysis of Interest Restrictions and Usury Laws, 41 J.\xc2\xa0Law &amp; Econ. 1, 26 (1998).  Such a rationale does not reflect a belief that lending markets are inefficient, any more than rent controls reflect a belief that real estate markets are inefficient.  Other historical rationales likewise shed no light on the point at issue here.  See <em>id.</em>, at 27.  The mere existence of usury laws is therefore weak support for any position. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71601 <em>et seq.</em>, not only fails to support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s position; it positively refutes it.  The plurality claims the Act reflects a belief that full disclosure promotes competition, see <em>ante</em>, at 16, and n. 24; the Act itself says as much, see 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71601(a).  But that belief obviously <em>presumes </em>markets are competitive (or, at least, that they were noncompetitive only because of the absence of the disclosures the Act now requires).  If lending markets were not competitive\xe2\x80\x94if the terms of financing were indeed \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by the seller,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x94disclosure requirements would be pointless, since consumers would have no use for the information.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second assumption (that the expected costs of default in Chapter 13 are normally no less than those at the time of lending), the plurality responds, not that Chapter 13 <em>as currently administered</em> is less risky than subprime lending generally, but that it <em>would </em>be less risky, if only bankruptcy courts would confirm fewer risky plans.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Of course, it is often quite difficult to predict which plans will fail.  See Norberg, Consumer Bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x99s New Clothes: An Empirical Study of Discharge and Debt Collection in Chapter 13, 7 Am. Bankr. Inst. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 415, 462 (1999).  But even assuming the high failure rate primarily reflects judicial dereliction rather than unavoidable uncertainty, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails for want of any reason to believe the dereliction will abate.  While full compensation can be attained either by low-risk plans and low interest rates, or by high-risk plans and high interest rates, it cannot be attained by <em>high</em>-risk plans and <em>low </em>interest rates, which, absent cause to anticipate a change in confirmation practices, is precisely what the formula approach would yield.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality also claims that the contract rate overcompensates creditors because it includes \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction costs and overall profits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But the same is true of the rate the plurality prescribes: The prime lending rate includes banks\xe2\x80\x99 overhead and profits.  These are necessary components of <em>any </em>commercial lending rate, since creditors will not lend money if they cannot cover their costs and return a level of profit sufficient to prevent their investors from going elsewhere.  See <em>Koopmans </em>v. <em>Farm Credit Services of Mid-America, ACA</em>, 102 F.\xc2\xa03d 874, 876 (CA7 1996).  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s criticism might have force if there were reason to believe subprime lenders made exorbitant profits while banks did not\xe2\x80\x94but, again, the data suggest otherwise.  See Lane, Regulator\xe2\x80\x99s View of Subprime Lending, at 6.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the plurality objects that similarly situated creditors might not be treated alike.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, and n.\xc2\xa017.  But the contract rate is only a presumption.  If a judge thinks it necessary to modify the rate to avoid unjustified disparity, he can do so.  For example, if two creditors charged different rates solely because they lent to the debtor at different times, the judge could average the rates or use the more recent one.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument might be valid against an approach that <em>irrebuttably </em>presumes the contract rate, but that is not what I \npropose.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defects of the formula approach far outweigh those of the contract-rate approach.  The formula approach starts with the prime lending rate\xe2\x80\x94a number that, while objective and easily ascertainable, is indisputably too low.  It then adjusts by adding a risk premium that, unlike the prime rate, is neither objective nor easily ascertainable.  If the risk premium is typically small relative to the prime rate\xe2\x80\x94as the 1.5% premium added to the 8% prime rate by the court below would lead one to believe\xe2\x80\x94then this subjective element of the computation might be forgiven.  But in fact risk premiums, if properly computed, would typically be substantial.  For example, if the 21% contract rate is an accurate reflection of risk in this case, the risk premium would be 13%\xe2\x80\x94nearly two-thirds of the total interest rate.  When the risk premium is the greater part of the overall rate, the formula approach no longer depends on objective and easily ascertainable numbers.  The prime rate becomes the objective tail wagging a dog of unknown size.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I explain below, the most relevant factors bearing on risk premium are (1) the probability of plan failure; (2) the rate of collateral depreciation; (3)\xc2\xa0the liquidity of the collateral market; and (4) the administrative expenses of enforcement.  Under the formula approach, a risk premium must be computed in every case, so judges will invariably grapple with these imponderables.  Under the contract-rate approach, by contrast, the task of assessing all these risk factors is entrusted to the entity most capable of undertaking it: the market.  See <em>Bank of America</em>, 526 U. S., at 457 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he best way to determine value is exposure to a market\xe2\x80\x9d).  All the risk factors are reflected (assuming market efficiency) in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s contract rate\xe2\x80\x94a number readily found in the loan document.  If neither party disputes it, the bankruptcy judge\xe2\x80\x99s task is at an end.  There are straightforward ways a debtor <em>could </em>dispute it\xe2\x80\x94for example, by showing that the creditor is now substantially oversecured, or that some other lender is willing to extend credit at a lower rate.  But unlike the formula approach, which requires difficult estimation in every case, the contract-rate approach requires it only when the parties choose to contest the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality defends the formula approach on the ground that creditors have better access to the relevant information.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  But this is not a case where we must choose between one initial estimate that is too low and another that is too high.  Rather, the choice is between one that is far too low and another that is generally reasonably accurate (or, if anything, a bit too low).  In these circumstances, consciously choosing the less accurate estimate merely because creditors have better information smacks more of policymaking than of faithful adherence to the statutory command that the secured creditor receive property worth \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not less than </em>the allowed amount\xe2\x80\x9d of its claim, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Moreover, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s argument assumes it is plausible\xe2\x80\x94and desirable\xe2\x80\x94that the issue will be litigated in most cases.  But the costs of conducting a detailed risk analysis and defending it in court are prohibitively high in relation to the amount at stake in most consumer loan cases.  Whatever approach we prescribe, the norm should be\xe2\x80\x94and undoubtedly will be\xe2\x80\x94that the issue is not litigated because it is not worth litigating.  Given this reality, it is far more important that the initial estimate be accurate than that the burden of proving inaccuracy fall on the better informed party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no better demonstration of the inadequacies of the formula approach than the proceedings in this case.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 economics expert testified that the 1.5% risk premium was \xe2\x80\x9cvery reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d because Chapter 13 plans are \xe2\x80\x9csupposed to be financially feasible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe borrowers are under the supervision of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 43.  Nothing in the record shows how these two platitudes were somehow manipulated to arrive at a figure of 1.5%.  It bears repeating that feasibility determinations and trustee oversight do not prevent at least 37% of confirmed Chapter 13 plans from failing.  On cross-examination, the expert admitted that he had only limited familiarity with the subprime auto lending market and that he was not familiar with the default rates or the costs of collection in that market.  <em>Id.</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  In light of these devastating concessions, it is impossible to view the 1.5% figure as anything other than a smallish number picked out of a hat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on even a rudimentary financial analysis of the facts of this case, the 1.5% figure is obviously wrong\xe2\x80\x94not just off by a couple percent, but probably by roughly an order of magnitude.  For a risk premium to be adequate, a hypothetical, rational creditor must be indifferent between accepting (1) the proposed risky stream of payments over time and (2) immediate payment of its present value in a lump sum.  Whether he is indifferent\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether the risk premium added to the prime rate is adequate\xe2\x80\x94can be gauged by comparing benefits and costs: on the one hand, the expected value of the extra interest, and on the other, the expected costs of default.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was offered a risk premium of 1.5% on top of the prime rate of 8%.  If that premium were fully paid as the plan contemplated, it would yield about $60.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  If the debtor defaulted, all or part of that interest would not be paid, so the expected value is only about $50.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The prime rate itself already includes some compensation for risk; as it turns out, about the same amount, yielding another $50.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Given the 1.5% risk premium, then, the total expected benefit to respondent was about $100.  Against this we must weigh the expected costs of default.  While precise calculations are impossible, rough estimates convey a sense of their scale.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first cost of default involves depreciation.  If the debtor defaults, the creditor can eventually repossess and sell the collateral, but by then it may be substantially less valuable than the remaining balance due\xe2\x80\x94and the debtor may stop paying long before the creditor receives permission to repossess.  When petitioners purchased their truck in this case, its value was almost equal to the principal balance on the loan.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  By the time the plan was confirmed, however, the truck was worth only $4,000, while the balance on the loan was $4,895.  If petitioners were to default on their Chapter 13 payments and if respondent suffered the same relative loss from depreciation, it would amount to about $550.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second cost of default involves liquidation.  The $4,000 to which respondent would be entitled if paid in a lump sum reflects the <em>replacement </em>value of the vehicle, <em>i.e.</em>, the amount it would cost the debtor to purchase a similar used truck.  See <em>Associates Commercial Corp.</em> v. <em>Rash</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/953/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/953/index.html">520 U. S. 953</a>, 965 (1997).  If the debtor defaults, the creditor cannot sell the truck for that amount; it receives only a lesser <em>foreclosure </em>value because collateral markets are not perfectly liquid and there is thus a spread between what a buyer will pay and what a seller will demand.  The foreclosure value of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 truck is not in the record, but, using the relative liquidity figures in <em>Rash </em>as a rough guide, respondent would suffer a further loss of about $450.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third cost of default consists of the administrative expenses of foreclosure.  While a Chapter 13 plan is in effect, the automatic stay prevents secured creditors from repossessing their collateral, even if the debtor fails to pay.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7362.  The creditor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney must move the bankruptcy court to lift the stay.  \xc2\xa7362(d).  In the District where this case arose, the filing fee for such motions is now $150.  See United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Schedule of Bankruptcy Fees (Nov. 1, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  And the standard attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee for such motions, according to one survey, is $350 in Indiana and as high as $875 in other States.  See J. Cossitt, Chapter 13 Attorney Fee Survey, American Bankruptcy Institute Annual Spring Meeting (Apr. 10\xe2\x80\x9313, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Moreover, bankruptcy judges will often excuse first offenses, so foreclosure may require multiple trips to court.  The total expected administrative expenses in the event of default could reasonably be estimated at $600 or more.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have omitted several other costs of default, but the point is already adequately made.  The three figures above total $1,600.  Even accepting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 low estimate of the plan failure rate, a creditor choosing the stream of future payments instead of the immediate lump sum would be selecting an alternative with an expected cost of about $590 ($1,600 multiplied by 37%, the chance of failure) and an expected benefit of about $100 (as computed above).  No rational creditor would make such a choice.  The risk premium over prime necessary to make these costs and benefits equal is in the neighborhood of 16%, for a total interest rate of 24%.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, many of the estimates I have made can be disputed.  Perhaps the truck will depreciate more slowly now than at first, perhaps the collateral market is more liquid than the one in <em>Rash</em>, perhaps respondent can economize on attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and perhaps there is some reason (other than judicial optimism) to think the Tills were unlikely to default.  I have made some liberal assumptions,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] but also some conservative ones.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  When a risk premium is off by an order of magnitude, one\xe2\x80\x99s estimates need not be very precise to show that it cannot possibly be correct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the 1.5% premium adopted in this case is far below anything approaching fair compensation.  That result is not unusual, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Valenti</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa03d 55, 64 (CA2 1997) (recommending a 1%\xe2\x80\x933% premium over the <em>treasury </em>rate\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, approximately a 0% premium over prime); it is the entirely predictable consequence of a methodology that tells bankruptcy judges to set interest rates based on highly imponderable factors.  Given the inherent uncertainty of the enterprise, what heartless bankruptcy judge can be expected to demand that the unfortunate debtor pay <em>triple</em> the prime rate as a condition of keeping his sole means of transportation?  It challenges human nature.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas rejects both the formula approach and the contract-rate approach.  He reads the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed under the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(B)(ii), to mean the proposed payments <em>if made as the plan contemplates</em>, so that the plan need only pay the risk-free rate of interest.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I would instead read this phrase to mean the right to receive payments that the plan vests in the creditor upon confirmation.  Because there is no guarantee that the promised payments will in fact be made, the value of this property right must account for the risk of nonpayment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewed in isolation, the phrase is susceptible of either meaning.  Both the promise to make payments and the proposed payments themselves are property rights, the former \xe2\x80\x9cto be distributed under the plan\xe2\x80\x9d immediately upon confirmation, and the latter over the life of the plan.  Context, however, supports my reading.  The cramdown option which the debtors employed here is only one of three routes to confirmation.  The other two\xe2\x80\x94creditor acceptance and collateral surrender, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71325(a)(5)(A), (C)\xe2\x80\x94\nare both creditor protective, leaving the secured creditor roughly as well off as he would have been had the debtor not sought bankruptcy protection.  Given this, it is unlikely the third option was meant to be substantially <em>under</em>protective; that would render it so much more favorable to debtors that few would ever choose one of the alternatives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The risk-free approach also leads to anomalous results.  Justice Thomas admits that, if a plan distributes a note rather than cash, the value of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty to be distributed\xe2\x80\x9d must reflect the risk of default on the note.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But there is no practical difference between obligating the debtor to make deferred payments under a plan and obligating the debtor to sign a note that requires those same payments.  There is no conceivable reason why Congress would give secured creditors risk compensation in one case but not the other.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Circuit authority uniformly rejects the risk-free approach.  While Circuits addressing the issue are divided over <em>how </em>to calculate risk, to my knowledge all of them require some compensation for risk, either explicitly or implicitly.

Justice Thomas identifies no decision adopting his view.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does our decision in <em>Rash</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/953/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/953/index.html">520 U. S. 953</a>, support the risk-free approach.  There we considered whether a secured creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim should be valued at what the debtor would pay to replace the collateral or at the lower price the creditor would receive from a foreclosure sale.  Justice Thomas contends that <em>Rash</em> selected the former in order to compensate creditors for the risk of plan failure, and that, having compensated them once in that context, we need not do so again here.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  I disagree with this reading of <em>Rash</em>.  The Bankruptcy Code provides that \xe2\x80\x9cvalue shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of [the] property.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7506(a).  <em>Rash</em> held that the foreclosure-value approach failed to give effect to this language, because it assigned the same value whether the debtor surrendered the collateral or was allowed to retain it in exchange for promised payments.  520 U. S., at 962.  \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s perspective as well as the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s, surrender and retention are not equivalent acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We did point out that retention entails risks for the creditor that surrender does not.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962\xe2\x80\x93963.  But we made no effort to correlate that increased risk with the difference between replacement and foreclosure value.  And we also pointed out that retention benefits the debtor by allowing him to continue to use the property\xe2\x80\x94a factor we considered \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f prime significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 963.  <em>Rash</em> stands for the proposition that surrender and retention are fundamentally different sorts of \xe2\x80\x9cdisposition or use,\xe2\x80\x9d calling for different valuations.  Nothing in the opinion suggests that we thought the valuation difference reflected the degree of increased risk, or that we adopted the replacement-value standard <em>in order to compensate</em> for increased risk.  To the contrary, we said that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactual use \xe2\x80\xa6 is the proper guide under a prescription hinged to the property\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98disposition or use.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress wanted to compensate secured creditors for the risk of plan failure, it would not have done so by prescribing a particular method of valuing collateral.  A plan may pose little risk even though the difference between foreclosure and replacement values is substantial, or great risk even though the valuation difference is small.  For example, if a plan proposes immediate cash payment to the secured creditor, he is entitled to the higher replacement value under <em>Rash</em> even though he faces no risk at all.  If the plan calls for deferred payments but the collateral consists of listed securities, the valuation difference may be trivial, but the creditor still faces substantial risks.  And a creditor oversecured in even the slightest degree at the time of bankruptcy derives no benefit at all from <em>Rash</em>, but still faces some risk of collateral depreciation.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are very good reasons for Congress to prescribe full risk compensation for creditors.  Every action in the free market has a reaction somewhere.  If subprime lenders are systematically undercompensated in bankruptcy, they will charge higher rates or, if they already charge the legal maximum under state law, lend to fewer of the riskiest borrowers.  As a result, some marginal but deserving borrowers will be denied vehicle loans in the first place.  Congress evidently concluded that widespread access to credit is worth preserving, even if it means being ungenerous to sympathetic debtors.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is unlikely to burnish the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for reasoned decisionmaking.  Eight Justices are in agreement that the rate of interest set forth in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s approved plan must include a premium for risk.  Of those eight, four are of the view that beginning with the contract rate would most accurately reflect the actual risk, and four are of the view that beginning with the prime lending rate would do so.  The ninth Justice takes no position on the latter point, since he disagrees with the eight on the former point; he would reverse because the rate proposed here, being above the risk-free rate, gave respondent no cause for complaint.  Because I read the statute to require full risk compensation, and because I would adopt a valuation method that has a realistic prospect of enforcing that directive, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The true rate of plan failure is almost certainly much higher.  The Girth study that yielded the 37% figure was based on data for a single division (Buffalo, New York) from over 20 years ago (1980\xe2\x80\x931982).  See 65 Ind. L.\xc2\xa0J., at 41.  A later study concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Buffalo division ha[d] achieved extraordinary results, far from typical for the country as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whitford, The Ideal of Individualized Justice: Consumer Bankruptcy as Consumer Protection, and Consumer Protection in Consumer Bankruptcy, 68 Am. Bankr. L.\xc2\xa0J. 397, 411, n. 50 (1994).  Although most of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s figures are based on studies that do not clearly exclude unconfirmed plans, one study includes enough detail to make the necessary correction: It finds 32% of filings successful, 18% dismissed without confirmation of a plan, and 49% dismissed after confirmation, for a postconfirmation failure rate of 60% (<em>i.e.</em>, 49%/(32%\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa049%)).  See Norberg, Consumer Bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x99s New Clothes: An Empirical Study of Discharge and Debt Collection in Chapter 13, 7 Am. Bankr. Inst. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 415, 440\xe2\x80\x93441 (1999).  This 60% failure rate is far higher than the 37% reported by Girth.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The contract rate is only a presumption, however, and either party remains free to prove that a higher or lower rate is appropriate in a particular case.  For example, if market interest rates generally have risen or fallen since the contract was executed, the contract rate could be adjusted by the same amount in cases where the difference was substantial enough that a party chose to make an issue of it.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To the extent the plurality argues that subprime lending markets are not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>perfectly </em>competitive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15 (emphasis added), I agree.  But there is no reason to doubt they are <em>reasonably </em>competitive, so that pricing in those markets is <em>reasonably </em>efficient.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I confess that this is \xe2\x80\x9cnonresponsive\xe2\x80\x9d to the argument made in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s footnote (that the contract interest rate may not accurately reflect risk when set jointly with a car\xe2\x80\x99s sale price), see <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa020; it is in response to the quite different argument made in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s text (that joint pricing shows that the subprime lending market is not competitive), see <em>ante</em>, at 15.  As to the <em>former </em>issue,  the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s footnote makes a fair point.  When the seller provides financing itself, there is a possibility that the contract interest rate might not reflect actual risk because a higher contract interest rate can be traded off for a lower sale price and vice versa.  Nonetheless, this fact is not likely to bias the contract-rate approach in favor of creditors to any significant degree.  If a creditor offers a promotional interest rate\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9czero-percent financing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in return for a higher sale price, the creditor bears the burden of showing that the true interest rate is higher than the contract rate.  The opposite tactic\xe2\x80\x94inflating the interest rate and decreasing the sale price\xe2\x80\x94is constrained at some level by the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s option to finance through a third party, thus taking advantage of the lower price while avoiding the higher interest rate.  (If a seller were to condition a price discount on providing the financing itself, the debtor should be entitled to rely on that condition to rebut the presumption that the contract rate reflects actual risk.)  Finally, the debtor remains free to rebut the contract rate with any other probative evidence.  While joint pricing may introduce some inaccuracy, the contract rate is still a far better initial estimate than the prime rate.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The plurality also argues that regulatory context is relevant because it \xe2\x80\x9cdistorts the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Federal disclosure requirements do not distort the market in any meaningful sense.  And while state usury laws do, that distortion works only to the benefit of debtors under the contract-rate approach, since it keeps contract rates artificially low.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left"> Some transaction costs are avoided by the creditor in bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x94\nfor example, loan-origination costs such as advertising.  But these are likely only a minor component of the interest rate.  According to the record in this case, for example, the average interest rate on new-car loans was roughly 8.5%\xe2\x80\x94only about 0.5% higher than the prime rate and 2.5% higher than the risk-free treasury rate.  App. 43 (testimony of Professor Steve Russell).  And the 2% difference between prime and treasury rates represented \xe2\x80\x9cmostly \xe2\x80\xa6 risk [and] to some extent transaction costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 42.  These figures suggest that loan-origination costs included in the new-car loan and prime rates but not in the treasury rate are likely only a fraction of a percent.  There is no reason to think they are substantially higher in the subprime auto lending market.  Any transaction costs the creditor avoids in bankruptcy are thus far less than the additional ones he incurs.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s other, miscellaneous criticisms do not survive scrutiny either.  That the cramdown provision applies to prime as well as subprime loans, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 18, proves nothing.  Nor is there any substance to the argument that the formula approach will perform better where \xe2\x80\x9cnational or local economic conditions drastically improved or declined after the original loan was issued.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  To the extent such economic changes are reflected by changes in the prime rate, the contract rate can be adjusted by the same amount.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.  And to the extent they are not, they present the same problem under either approach: When a party disputes the presumption, the court must gauge the significance of the economic change and adjust accordingly.  The difference, again, is that the contract-rate approach starts with a number that (but for the economic change) is reasonably accurate, while the formula approach starts with a number that (with or without the economic change) is not even close.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Given its priority, and in light of the amended plan\xe2\x80\x99s reduced debtor contributions, the $4,000 secured claim would be fully repaid by about the end of the second year of the plan.
