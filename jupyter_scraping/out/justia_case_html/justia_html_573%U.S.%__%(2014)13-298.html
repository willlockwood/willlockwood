It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea.  On their face, they are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third party to mitigate settlement risk.  Like the risk hedging in Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and the use of a third-party intermediary (or \xe2\x80\x9cclearing house\xe2\x80\x9d) is a building block of the modern economy.

Stating an abstract idea while adding the words \xe2\x80\x9capply it with a computer\xe2\x80\x9d simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result.  Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional featur[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that provides any \xe2\x80\x9cpractical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, supra, at ___.

Claim 1 recited a series of steps for hedging risk, including: (1) initiating a series of financial transactions between providers and consumers of a commodity; (2) identifying market participants that have a counterrisk for the same commodity; and (3) initiating a series of transactions between those market participants and the commodity provider to balance the risk position of the first series of consumer transactions.

Specifically, the claims described \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 611.  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[h]edging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and  taught in any introductory finance class.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe concept of hedging\xe2\x80\x9d as recited by the claims in suit was therefore a patent-ineligible \xe2\x80\x9cabstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt follows from our prior cases, and Bilski in particular, that the claims at issue here are directed to an abstract idea.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims involve a method of exchanging financial obligations between two parties using a third-party intermediary to mitigate settlement risk.  The intermediary creates and updates \xe2\x80\x9cshadow\xe2\x80\x9d records to reflect the value of each party\xe2\x80\x99s actual accounts held at \xe2\x80\x9cexchange institutions,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby permitting only those transactions for which the parties have sufficient resources.  At the end of each day, the intermediary issues irrevocable instructions to the exchange institutions to carry out the permitted transactions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn their face, the claims before us are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third party to mitigate settlement risk.  Like the risk hedging in Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see, e.g., Emery, Speculation on the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States, in 7 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law 283, 346\xe2\x80\x93356 (1896) (discussing the use of a \xe2\x80\x9cclearing-house\xe2\x80\x9d as an intermediary to reduce settlement risk).  The use of a third-party intermediary (or \xe2\x80\x9cclearing house\xe2\x80\x9d) is also a building block of the modern economy.  See, e.g., Yadav, The Problematic Case of Clearinghouses in Complex Markets, 101 Geo. L. J. 387, 406\xe2\x80\x93412 (2013); J. Hull, Risk Management and Financial Institutions 103\xe2\x80\x93104 (3d ed. 2012).  Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an \xe2\x80\x9cabstract idea\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the scope of \xc2\xa7101.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner acknowledges that its claims describe intermediated settlement, see Brief for Petitioner 4, but rejects the conclusion that its claims recite an \xe2\x80\x9cabstract idea.\xe2\x80\x9d  Drawing on the presence of mathematical formulas in some of our abstract-ideas precedents, petitioner contends that the abstract-ideas category is confined to \xe2\x80\x9cpreexisting, fundamental truth[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exis[t\xc2\xa0] in principle apart from any human action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 23, 26 (quoting Mayo, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBilski belies petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s assertion.  The concept of risk hedging we identified as an abstract idea in that case cannot be described as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreexisting, fundamental truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  The patent in Bilski simply involved a \xe2\x80\x9cseries of steps instructing how to hedge risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599.  Al-though hedging is a longstanding commercial practice, id.,  at 599, it is a method of organizing human activity, not a \xe2\x80\x9ctruth\xe2\x80\x9d about the natural world \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that has always existed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 22 (quoting Flook, supra, at 593, n.\xc2\xa015).  One of the claims in Bilski reduced hedging to a mathematical formula, but the Court did not assign any special significance to that fact, much less the sort of talismanic significance petitioner claims.  Instead, the Court grounded its conclusion that all of the claims at issue were abstract ideas in the understanding that risk hedging was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamental economic practice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 611.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, we need not labor to delimit the precise contours of the \xe2\x80\x9cabstract ideas\xe2\x80\x9d category in this case.  It is enough to recognize that there is no meaningful distinction between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the concept of intermediated settlement at issue here.  Both are squarely within the realm of \xe2\x80\x9cabstract ideas\xe2\x80\x9d as we have used that term.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the claims at issue are directed to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, we turn to the second step in Mayo\xe2\x80\x99s framework.

A claim that recites an abstract idea must include \xe2\x80\x9cadditional features\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure \xe2\x80\x9cthat the [claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).

The patents at issue in Mayo claimed a method for measuring metabolites in the bloodstream in order to calibrate the appropriate dosage of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune dis- eases.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x936).  The respondent in that case contended that the claimed method was a patent-eligible application of natural laws that describe the relationship between the concentration of certain metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage will be harmful or ineffective.  But methods for determining metabolite levels were already \xe2\x80\x9cwell known in the art,\xe2\x80\x9d and the process at issue amounted to \xe2\x80\x9cnothing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  \xe2\x80\x9cSimply appending conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality,\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d to supply an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inventive concept.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 8, 3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe introduction of a computer into the claims does not alter the analysis at Mayo step two.  In Benson, for example, we considered a patent that claimed an algorithm implemented on \xe2\x80\x9ca general-purpose digital computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 64.

But the computer implementation did not supply the necessary inventive concept; the process could be \xe2\x80\x9ccarried out in existing computers long in use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We accordingly \xe2\x80\x9cheld that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, [i]s not a patentable application of that principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Benson, supra, at 64).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFlook is to the same effect.

The invention in Diehr used a \xe2\x80\x9cthermocouple\xe2\x80\x9d to record constant temperature measure-ments inside the rubber mold\xe2\x80\x94something \xe2\x80\x9cthe industry ha[d] not been able to obtain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 178, and n.\xc2\xa03.  The temperature measurements were then fed into a computer, which repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time by using the mathematical equation.  Id., at 178\xe2\x80\x93179.  These additional steps, we recently explained, \xe2\x80\x9ctransformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12).  In other words, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because they improved an existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.  Stating an abstract idea \xe2\x80\x9cwhile adding the words \xe2\x80\x98apply it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is not enough for patent eligibility.  Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to a particular technological environment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bilski, supra, at 610\xe2\x80\x93611.  Stating an abstract idea while adding the words \xe2\x80\x9capply it with a computer\xe2\x80\x9d simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result.  Thus, if a patent\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to \xe2\x80\x9cimplemen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d an abstract idea \xe2\x80\x9con .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a computer,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16), that addition cannot impart patent eligibility.  This conclusion accords with the pre-emption concern that undergirds our \xc2\xa7101 jurisprudence.  Given the ubiquity of computers, see 717 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring), wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional featur[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that provides any \xe2\x80\x9cpractical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that a computer \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily exist[s] in the physical, rather than purely conceptual, realm,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 39, is beside the point.  There is no dispute that a computer is a tangible system (in \xc2\xa7101 terms, a \xe2\x80\x9cmachine\xe2\x80\x9d), or that many computer-implemented claims are formally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter.  But if that were the end of the \xc2\xa7101 inquiry, an applicant could claim any principle of the physical or social sciences by reciting a computer system configured to implement the relevant concept.  Such a result would make the determination of patent eligibility \xe2\x80\x9cdepend simply on the draftsman\xe2\x80\x99s art,\xe2\x80\x9d Flook, supra, at 593, thereby eviscerating the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Myriad, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe representative method claim in this case recites the following steps: (1) \xe2\x80\x9ccreating\xe2\x80\x9d shadow records for each counterparty to a transaction; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cobtaining\xe2\x80\x9d start-of-day balances based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 real-world accounts at exchange institutions; (3) \xe2\x80\x9cadjusting\xe2\x80\x9d the shadow records as transactions are entered, allowing only those transactions for which the parties have sufficient resources; and (4) issuing irrevocable end-of-day instructions to the exchange institutions to carry out the permitted transactions.  See n.\xc2\xa02, supra.  Petitioner principally contends that the claims are patent eligible because these steps \xe2\x80\x9crequire a substantial and meaningful role for the computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 48.  As stipulated, the claimed method requires the use of a computer to create electronic records, track multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous instructions; in other words, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he computer is itself the intermediary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the foregoing, see supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314, the relevant question is whether the claims here do more than simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.  They do not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaking the claim elements separately, the function performed by the computer at each step of the process is \xe2\x80\x9c[p]urely conventional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Using a computer to create and maintain \xe2\x80\x9cshadow\xe2\x80\x9d accounts amounts to electronic recordkeeping\xe2\x80\x94one of the most basic functions of a computer.  See, e.g., Benson, 409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 65 (noting that a computer \xe2\x80\x9coperates .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. upon both new and previously stored data\xe2\x80\x9d).  The same is true with respect to the use of a computer to obtain data, adjust account balances, and issue automated instructions; all of these computer functions are \xe2\x80\x9cwell-understood, routine, conventional activit[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d previously known to the industry.  Mayo, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  In short, each step does no more than require a generic computer to perform generic computer functions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsidered \xe2\x80\x9cas an ordered combination,\xe2\x80\x9d the computer components of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s method \xe2\x80\x9cad[d] nothing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Viewed as a whole, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s method claims simply recite the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer.  See 717 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring) (noting that the representative method claim \xe2\x80\x9clacks any express language to define the computer\xe2\x80\x99s participation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The method claims do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself.  See ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no specific or limiting recitation of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. improved computer technology .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  Nor do they effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field.  See, e.g., Diehr, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 177\xe2\x80\x93178.  Instead, the claims at issue amount to \xe2\x80\x9cnothing significantly more\xe2\x80\x9d than an instruction to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer.  Mayo, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Under our precedents, that is not \xe2\x80\x9cenough\xe2\x80\x9d to transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.

As to its system claims, petitioner emphasizes that those claims recite \xe2\x80\x9cspecific hardware\xe2\x80\x9d configured to perform \xe2\x80\x9cspecific computerized functions.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 53.  But what petitioner characterizes as specific hardware\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cdata processing system\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications controller\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdata storage unit,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, see App. 954, 958, 1257\xe2\x80\x94is purely functional and generic.  Nearly every computer will include a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications controller\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdata storage unit\xe2\x80\x9d capable of performing the basic calculation, storage, and transmission functions required by the method claims.  See 717 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1290 (Lourie, J., concurring).  As a result, none of the hardware recited by the system claims \xe2\x80\x9coffers a meaningful limitation beyond generally linking \xe2\x80\x98the use of the [method] to a particular technological environment,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, implementation via computers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1291 (quoting Bilski, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 610\xe2\x80\x93611).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPut another way, the system claims are no different from the method claims in substance.
