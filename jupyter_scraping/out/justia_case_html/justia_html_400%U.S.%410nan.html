The Judicial Officer of the Department holds a trial-type hearing at which a full record is transcribed.

If, however, the Postmaster General wishes to detain the defendant\'s incoming mail before the termination of the \xc2\xa7 4006 proceedings, he may apply to the United States District Court for the district in which the defendant resides, under 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4007, which in pertinent part provides: [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"In preparation for or during the pendency of proceedings under [\xc2\xa7 4006] of this title, the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 400 U.

The administrative hearing was concluded December 5, 1968.  The Judicial Officer filed his decision December 31, 1968, finding that the specified magazines were obscene, and therefore entered a \xc2\xa7 4006 order -- 61 days after the complaint was filed.  Mail Box filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking a declaratory judgment that \xc2\xa7 4006 was unconstitutional and an injunction against enforcement of the administrative order.  A three-judge court was convened, and held that 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4006 "is unconstitutional on its face, because it fails to meet the requirements of <em>Freedman v. Maryland</em> (1965) <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U. S. 51</a></span>. . . ."  305 F.Supp. 634, 635 (1969).  The court therefore vacated the administrative order, directed the delivery "forthwith" of all mail addressed to Mail Box, and enjoined any proceedings to enforce \xc2\xa7 4006.</p>\n<p>In <em>Book Bin,</em> the Postmaster General applied to the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for a \xc2\xa7 4007 order pending the completion of \xc2\xa7 4006 proceedings against Book Bin. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Book Bin counterclaimed, asserting that both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4006 and 4007 were unconstitutional and that their enforcement should be enjoined.  A three-judge court was convened, and held both sections unconstitutional.  It agreed with the three-judge court in <em>Mail Box </em>that the procedures of \xc2\xa7 4006 were fatally deficient under <em>Freedman v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U. S. 51</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 400 U.

Since \xc2\xa7 4006, on its face, and \xc2\xa7 4007, as applied, are procedures designed to deny use of the mails to commercial distributors of obscene literature, those procedures violate the First Amendment unless they include built-in safeguards against curtailment of constitutionally protected expression, for Government</p>\n<p>"is not free to adopt whatever procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity . . . without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech."</p>\n<p><em>Marcus v.

Rather, the First Amendment requires that procedures be incorporated that</p>\n<p>"ensure against the curtailment of constitutionally protected expression, which is often separated from obscenity only by a dim and uncertain line. . . .  Our insistence that regulations of obscenity scrupulously embody the most rigorous procedural safeguards . . . is . . . but a special instance of the larger principle that the freedoms of expression must be ringed about with adequate bulwarks. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Bantam Books,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 400 U.

The three-judge courts correctly held in these cases that our decision in <em>Freedman v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U. S. 51</a></span> (1965) compels this conclusion.  We there considered the constitutionality of a motion picture censorship procedure administered by a State Board of Censors.  We held that, to avoid constitutional infirmity, a scheme of administrative censorship must:  place the burdens of initiating judicial review and of proving that the material is unprotected expression on the censor; require "prompt judicial review" -- a final judicial determination on the merits within a specified, brief period -- to prevent the administrative decision of the censor from achieving an effect of finality; and limit to preservation of the <em>status quo</em> for the shortest, fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution, any restraint imposed in advance of the final judicial determination.  380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#58">380 U. S. 58</a></span>-60.</p>\n<p>These safeguards are lacking in the administrative censorship scheme created by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4006, 4007, and the regulations. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The scheme has no statutory provision requiring governmentally initiated judicial participation in the procedure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 400 U. S. 418</a></p><p> which bars the magazines from the mails, or even any provision assuring prompt judicial review.  The scheme does differ from the Maryland scheme involved in <em>Freedman</em> in that, under the Maryland scheme, the motion picture could not be exhibited pending conclusion of the administrative hearing, whereas, under \xc2\xa7 4006, the order to return mail or to refuse to pay money orders is not imposed until there has been an administrative determination that the magazines are obscene.  This, however, does not redress the fatal flaw of the procedure in failing to require that the Postmaster General seek to obtain a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity of the material; rather, once the administrative proceedings disapprove the magazines the distributor "must assume the burden of instituting judicial proceedings and of persuading the courts that the . . . [magazines are] protected expression."  380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#59">380 U. S. 59</a></span>-60.  The First Amendment demands that the Government must assume this burden.</p>\n<p>"The teaching of our cases is that, because only a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding ensures the necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression, only a procedure requiring a judicial determination suffices to impose a valid final restraint."</p>\n<p>380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#58">380 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, once a \xc2\xa7 4006 administrative order has been entered against the distributor, there being no provision for judicial review, the Postmaster may stamp as "Unlawful" and immediately return to the sender orders for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 400 U.

Such a scheme</p>\n<p>"presents peculiar dangers to constitutionally protected speech. . . .  Because the censor\'s business is to censor, there inheres the danger that he may well be less responsive than a court -- part of an independent branch of government -- to the constitutionally protected interests in free expression.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Appellants suggest that we avoid the constitutional question raised by the failure of \xc2\xa7 4006 to provide that the Government seek a prompt judicial determination by construing that section to deny the administrative order any effect whatever, if judicial review is sought by the distributor, until the completion of that review.  Apart from the fact that this suggestion neither requires that the appellants initiate judicial proceedings, nor provides for a prompt judicial determination, it is for Congress, not this Court, to rewrite the statute.</p>\n<p>The authority of the Postmaster General under \xc2\xa7 4007 to apply to a district court for an order directing the detention of the distributor\'s incoming mail pending the conclusion of the \xc2\xa7 4006 administrative proceedings and any appeal therefrom plainly does not remedy the defects in \xc2\xa7 4006.  That section does not provide a prompt proceeding for a judicial adjudication of the challenged obscenity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 400 U. S. 420</a></p><p> of the magazine. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  First, it is entirely discretionary with the Attorney General whether to institute a \xc2\xa7 4007 action and, therefore, the section does not satisfy the requirement that the appellants assume the burden of seeking a judicial determination of the alleged obscenity of the magazines.  Second, the district court is required to grant the relief sought by the Postmaster General upon a showing merely of "probable cause" to believe \xc2\xa7 4006 is being violated.  We agree with the three-judge court in <em>Book Bin</em> that to satisfy the demand of the First Amendment,</p>\n<p>"it is vital that prompt judicial review on the issue of obscenity -- rather than merely probable cause -- be assured on the Government\'s initiative before the severe restrictions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4006, 4007, are invoked."</p>\n<p>306 F.Supp. at 1028.  Indeed, the statute expressly provides that "An action taken by a court hereunder does not affect or determine any fact at issue in the statutory proceedings."

Any order issued by the district court remains in effect "pending the conclusion of the statutory proceedings and any appeal therefrom." [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]   Thus, the statute not only fails to provide that the district court should make a final judicial determination of the question of obscenity, expressly giving that authority to the Judicial Officer, but it fails to provide that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny restraint imposed in advance of a final judicial determination on the merits must . . . be limited to preservation of the <em>status quo</em> for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution."</p>\n<p>380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#59">380 U.

In 1956, the Postmaster General sought and obtained the power himself to enter an order, pending administrative proceedings under \xc2\xa7 4006, that all mail addressed to the defendant in the \xc2\xa7 4006 proceeding be impounded.  The order was to expire at the end of 20 days unless the Postmaster General sought in a federal district court, an order continuing the impounding.  70 Stat. 699. In 1959, extensive hearings were held in the House on the Post Office\'s request that the 20-day period be extended to 45 days, and that the standard of necessity be changed to "public interest."  Hearings on Obscene Matter Sent Through the Mail before the Subcommittee on Postal Operations of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pt.s. 1, 2, and 3 (1959); Hearings on Detention of Mail for Temporary Periods before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959).  Instead, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 4007, which stripped the Postmaster General of his power to issue an interim order for any period and directed him to seek such an order in a federal district court. One Senate Report expressed misgivings when the Postmaster General had originally sought the impounding power:</p>\n<p>"The committee recognizes that, even in its present form, the bill gives the Postmaster General extraordinary and summary powers to impose a substantial penalty by impounding a person\'s mail for up to 20 days in advance of any hearing or any review by the courts.  Such power is directly contrary to the letter and spirit of normal due process, as exemplified by the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires a hearing before any penalty may be imposed.  The Post Office Department has made its case for this legislation on the grounds that a temporary and summary procedure is required to deal with fly-by-night operators using the mails to defraud or to peddle pornography, who may go out of business -- or change the name of their business or their business address -- before normal legal procedures can be brought into operation.  The Post Office Department has not recommended, nor does this committee approve, the use of the temporary impounding procedure under this bill as a substitute for the normal practice of an advance hearing or the bringing of an indictment for violation of the criminal code in all cases involving legitimate and well established business operations.  The committee would not approve the use of the extraordinary summary procedure under the bill against legitimate publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books in cases in which a Postmaster General might take objection to an article, an issue, or a volume."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 2234, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1956).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 4007 also authorizes the Postmaster General to apply for an impounding order during the pendency of proceedings under 39 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4005 (1964 ed., Supp. V), now \xc2\xa7 3005.  Section 4005, as amended (82 Stat. 1153), permits the return to the sender of any mail sent to the perpetrator of what the Postmaster General finds to be a scheme for obtaining money by means of false representations.  That section has been upheld against First Amendment attack.  <em>Donaldson v. Read Magazine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/178/case.html">333 U.

The Government does not argue in its brief that <em>Donaldson</em> compels the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 4006 also is constitutional, but only that "Section 4006, like the fraud statute upheld in <em>Donaldson,</em> . . . meets all necessary constitutional standards."

On oral argument, the Government suggested that an affirmance in this case might jeopardize the validity of \xc2\xa7 4005 and the continued vitality of <em>Donaldson.</em>  But no argument was offered to support the suggestion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The order was sought with respect to a single issue of one magazine.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>We therefore have no occasion to consider the argument of appellees that <em>Stanley v.
