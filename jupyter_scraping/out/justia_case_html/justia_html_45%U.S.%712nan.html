S. 713</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The bill was filed in this case in the Circuit Court for the District of Kentucky, by the complainants, setting forth that William Woodworth was the inventor and patentee of a certain planing machine, describing it; also the extension of the said patent to W. W. Woodworth, as administrator, and that E. V. Bunn, one of the complainants, took an assignment from the said W. W. Woodworth for the exclusive right of making, using, and vending machines for planing &amp;c., under the extension of the patent, within the limits of the City of Louisville, and in the district of country ten miles around said city.</p>\n<p>The bill further charges that the defendants have, in violation of the rights of the complainants, erected and put in operation in the City of Louisville a planing machine &amp;c., which machine is, in all its material parts, substantially like and upon the plan of the machine of the complainants, and persist in using the same.</p>\n<p>The defendant James Wilson answered the bill, substantially denying most of the material allegations contained in it.  The other defendants answered by denying that they had any interest in the machine.</p>\n<p>The court granted an injunction enjoining the defendant James Wilson from using the machine.</p>\n<p>Afterwards an application was made to the court, on behalf of the complainants, for a rule upon the defendant, James Wilson, to show cause why an attachment should not be issued against him for a violation of the injunction, which was accordingly granted.</p>\n<p>The defendant showed a cause by affidavit, in which he affirms, that immediately on the service of the injunction he had ceased to use the machine mentioned in the bill, and conformed himself to the order of the court, and that he had purchased and set up Bicknell\'s planing machine, which he was using, and which was substantially different from the machine of the complainants.</p>\n<p>Much testimony was taken in the court below, on the question whether the machine which the defendant had substituted and was using was, in all its material and substantial parts, like Woodworth\'s, which it is not material to refer to more particularly.  A great deal of testimony was also taken, for the purpose of showing that Woodworth was not the original inventor of the complainant\'s machine, which it is also not necessary to recite.</p>\n<p>The cause afterwards came to a hearing on the merits, upon the pleadings and proofs, and also upon the rule previously granted against the defendant, to show cause why an attachment should not issue for a violation of the injunction, and, after consideration, the court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill, and discharged the rule to show cause, with costs.</p>\n<p>As the opinion of the court refers in general terms to the interest of Woodworth under the assignment, as a justification for his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="714">Page 45 U.

Woodworth, administrator of said William Woodworth, hath applied and obtained an extension of said letters patent for the term of seven years from and after the expiration of said patent, to-wit, 27 December, 1842, pursuant to an act of Congress in such case made and provided, and hath a certificate of said extension annexed to said patent, signed by the Commissioner of Patents, under the great seal of the Patent Office of the United States, and dated November 16, A.D. 1842.  And whereas E. V. Bunn, of the City of Louisville, in the State of Kentucky, hath fully viewed, examined, and considered for himself the said improvement, and of his own motion hath requested and desired the said William W.

E. Sickles."</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The objection taken that the administrator could not apply for an extension of the patent granted to Woodworth, his intestate, under the eighteenth section of the patent law has been disposed of in the previous case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/646/case.html">Wilson v. Rousseau,</a></span></em> and need not be further noticed.</p>\n<p>Another objection taken to the right of the complainants to maintain the suit is that Woodworth was not the first and original inventor of the planing machine, against the using of which the defendant was enjoined.</p>\n<p>Without going into the proofs in the case, which are very voluminous, it will be sufficient to state, that after fully considering all the evidence produced bearing upon the question, the court is satisfied that the weight of it is decidedly against the objection, and in favor of the allegation in the bill, that Woodworth was the original inventor of the machine.</p>\n<p>It is objected, also, that the specifications accompanying the patent were not sufficiently full and explicit, so as to enable a mechanic of ordinary skill to build a machine. The court is not satisfied, according to the proof in the case, that the objection is well founded, and it cannot be relied on as affording sufficient ground for the dismissal of the bill.</p>\n<p>A further objection was taken, that W. W. Woodworth, one of the complainants, was improperly joined with E. V. Bunn, the assignee of the exclusive right in Louisville and ten miles around it.  The Court is of opinion, that the interest of Woodworth in the assignment, as appears from the record, is sufficient to justify his being made a party jointly with the assignee.</p>\n<p>Some other objections were taken to the maintenance of the suit on the argument, which it is not material to notice particularly; they have all been considered, and in the judgment of the court afford no sufficient ground for the dismissal of the bill and the dissolving of the injunction.</p>\n<p><em>We think the court erred, and that the decree dismissing the bill, as to the defendant James Wilson, and dissolving the injunction, should be reversed, and that a perpetual injunction should issue.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
