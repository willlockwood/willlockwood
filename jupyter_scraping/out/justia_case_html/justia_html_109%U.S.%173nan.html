CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The petition of Guion was for leave to appeal from a decree in a suit to which he was not a party.  We decided in <em>Ex Parte Cutting,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/14/case.html">94 U. S. 14</a></span>, that such an appeal could not be taken.  He had applied for leave to become a party, but this leave was not given.  So he is not a party to the decree from which he appeals.  But if he is, he has never perfected an appeal by giving the necessary security.</p>\n<p><em>Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
