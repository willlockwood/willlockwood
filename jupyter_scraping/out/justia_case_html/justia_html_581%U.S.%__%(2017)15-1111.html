The FHA prohibits, among other things, racial discrimination in connection with real-estate transactions, 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73604(b), 3605(a), and permits any \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d to file a civil damages action for a violation of the Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73613(a)(1)(A), (c)(1).  The City\xe2\x80\x99s complaints charge that the Banks intentionally targeted predatory practices at African-American and Latino neighborhoods and residents, lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.  The City alleges that the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory conduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in majority-minority neighborhoods, which impaired the City\xe2\x80\x99s effort to assure racial integration, diminished the City\xe2\x80\x99s property-tax revenue, and increased demand for police, fire, and other municipal services.  The District Court dismissed the complaints on the grounds that (1) the harms alleged fell outside the zone of interests the FHA protects and (2) the complaints failed to show a sufficient causal connection between the City\xe2\x80\x99s injuries and the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory conduct.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The City is an \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d authorized to bring suit under the FHA.  In addition to satisfying constitutional standing requirements, see <i>Spokeo, Inc. </i>v.<i> Robins</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, a plaintiff must show that the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action he or she asserts.  It is presumed that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of action \xe2\x80\x9conly to plaintiffs whose interests \xe2\x80\x98fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lexmark Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</i> v. <i>Static Control Components, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The City\xe2\x80\x99s claims of financial injury are, at the least, \xe2\x80\x9carguably within the zone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d the FHA protects.  <i>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.</i> v. <i>Camp</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150\n.  The FHA defines an \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany person who\xe2\x80\x9d either \xe2\x80\x9cclaims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\xe2\x80\x9d or believes that such an injury \xe2\x80\x9cis about to occur,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73602(i).  This Court has said that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cperson aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d in the original version of the FHA \xe2\x80\x9cshowed \xe2\x80\x98a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Trafficante</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n409 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205\n; and has held that the Act permits suit by parties similarly situated to the City, see, <i>e.g., Gladstone, Realtors</i> v. <i>Village of Bellwood</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 91\n (village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by racial-steering practices).  Against the backdrop of those decisions, Congress did not materially alter the definition of person \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d when it reenacted the current version of the Act.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Banks nonetheless contend that the definition sets boundaries that fall short of those the Constitution sets.  Even assuming that some form of their argument is valid, this Court concludes that the City\xe2\x80\x99s financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s claims are similar in kind to those of the Village of Bellwood, which the Court held in <i>Gladstone</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>could bring suit under the FHA.  The Court explained that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory conduct adversely affected the village by, among other things, producing a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant reduction in property values [that] directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base, thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s alleged economic injuries thus arguably fall within the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests, as this Court has previously interpreted that statute.  <i>Stare decisis</i> principles compel the Court\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to those precedents, and principles of statutory interpretation demand that the Court respect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit erred in concluding that the complaints met the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s proximate-cause requirement based solely on the finding that the City\xe2\x80\x99s alleged financial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct.  A claim for damages under the FHA is akin to a \xe2\x80\x9ctort action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Holley</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280\n, and is thus subject to the common-law requirement that loss is attributable \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lexmark</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  The proximate-cause analysis asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at ___.  With respect to the FHA, foreseeability alone does not ensure the required close connection.  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a remedy for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation, which may \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cause ripples of harm to flow\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d far beyond the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519\n; and doing so would risk \xe2\x80\x9cmassive and complex damages litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 545.  Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires \xe2\x80\x9csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holmes </i>v.<i> Securities Investors Protection Corporation</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n.  The Court has repeatedly applied directness principles to statutes with \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law foundations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Anza</i> v. <i>Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 451\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The general tendency\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in these cases, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hemi Group, LLC</i> v. <i>City of New York</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  What falls within that step depends in part on the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the statutory cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lexmark</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___, and an assessment \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of what is administratively possible and convenient,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Holmes</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 268.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"> The Court declines to draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA, particularly where neither the Eleventh Circuit nor other courts of appeals have weighed in on the issue.  Instead, the lower courts should define, in the first instance, the contours of proximate cause under the FHA and decide how that standard applies to the City\xe2\x80\x99s claims for lost property-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses.

The FHA prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d because of \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9csale or rental\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ca dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73604; accord, \xc2\xa73605(a); \xc2\xa73606.  Miami\xe2\x80\x99s complaints do not allege that any defendant discriminated against it within the meaning of the FHA.  Neither is Miami attempting to bring a lawsuit on behalf of its residents against whom petitioners allegedly discriminated.  Rather, Miami\xe2\x80\x99s theory is that, between 2004 and 2012, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly discriminatory mortgage-lending practices led to defaulted loans, which led to foreclosures, which led to vacant houses, which led to decreased property values, which led to reduced property taxes and urban blight.  See 800 F.\xc2\xa03d 1262, 1268 (CA11 2015); 801 F. 3d 1258, 1266 (CA11 2015).

For the reasons explained below, I would hold that Miami\xe2\x80\x99s injuries fall outside the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests.  I would also hold that, in any event, Miami\xe2\x80\x99s alleged injuries are too remote to satisfy the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s proximate-cause requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A plaintiff seeking to bring suit under a federal statute must show not only that he has standing under Article III, <i>ante</i>, at 5, but also that his \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint fall[s] within the zone of interests protected by the law\xe2\x80\x9d he invokes, <i>Lexmark Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc. </i>v.<i> Static Control Components, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).

That language does not hint\xe2\x80\x94much less expressly provide\xe2\x80\x94that Congress sought to depart from the common-law rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have considered similar language in other statutes and reached the same conclusion.  In <i>Thompson </i>v. <i>North American Stainless, LP</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170 (2011)\n, for example, we considered Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s private-enforcement provision, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a person claiming to be aggrieved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d may file an employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  <i>Id.</i>, at 173  (quoting \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b)).  We unanimously concluded that Congress did not depart from the zone-of-interests limitation in Title VII by using that language.  <i>Id.</i>, at 175\xe2\x80\x93178.  And in <i>Lexmark</i>, we interpreted a provision of the Lanham Act that permitted \xe2\x80\x9cany person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false advertising\xe2\x80\x9d to sue.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even when faced with the broader \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d language, we expressly rejected the argument that the statute conferred a cause of action upon anyone claiming an Article III injury in fact.  We observed that it was unlikely that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\xe2\x80\x9d and we concluded that the zone-of-interests test was the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 11)<i> </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, some language in our older precedents suggests that the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests extends to the limits of Article III.  See <i>Trafficante</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins.

Here, as in any other case, the text of the FHA defines the zone of interests that the statute protects.  See <i>Lexmark,</i> <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The FHA permits \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n aggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d to sue, \xc2\xa73613(a)(1)(A), if he \xe2\x80\x9cclaims to have been injured by a <i>discriminatory housing practice</i>\xe2\x80\x9d or believes that he \xe2\x80\x9cwill be injured by a <i>discriminatory housing practice</i> that is about to occur,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73602(i)(1), (2) (emphasis added).  Specifically, the FHA makes it unlawful to do any of the following on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9crefuse to sell or rent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a dwelling,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73604(a); discriminate in the \xe2\x80\x9cterms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73604(b); \xe2\x80\x9cmake, print, or publish .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73604(c); \xe2\x80\x9crepresent to any person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73604(d); \xe2\x80\x9cinduce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of\xe2\x80\x9d certain characteristics, \xc2\xa73604(e); or discriminate in the provision of real estate or brokerage services, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73605, 3606.  The quintessential \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d in cases involving violations of the FHA is a prospective home buyer or lessee discriminated against during the home-buying or leasing process.  Our cases have also suggested that the interests of a person who lives in a neighborhood or apartment complex that remains segregated (or that risks becoming segregated) as a result of a discriminatory housing practice may be arguably within the outer limit of the interests the FHA protects.  See <i>Trafficante</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 211 (concluding that one purpose of the FHA was to promote \xe2\x80\x9ctruly integrated and balanced living patterns\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Miami\xe2\x80\x99s asserted injuries are not arguably related to the interests the statute protects.  Miami asserts that it received \xe2\x80\x9creduced property tax revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 233, 417, and that it was forced to spend more money on \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipal services that it provided and still must provide to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 417; see also <i>ante</i>, at 2.<i> </i>The city blames these expenditures on the falling property values and vacant homes that resulted from foreclosures.  But nothing in the text of the FHA suggests that Congress was concerned about decreased property values, foreclosures, and urban blight, much less about strains on municipal budgets that might follow.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Miami\xe2\x80\x99s interests are markedly distinct from the interests this Court confronted in <i>Trafficante</i>, <i>Gladstone</i>, and <i>Havens</i>.  In <i>Trafficante</i>, one white and one black tenant of an apartment complex sued on the ground that the complex discriminated against nonwhite rental applicants.  409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 206\xe2\x80\x93208.  They argued that this discrimination deprived them of the social and economic benefits of living in an integrated community.  <i>Id.</i>, at 208.<i> </i> In <i>Gladstone</i>, residents in a village sued based on alleged discrimination in the home-buying process.  441 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 93\xe2\x80\x9395.  They contended that white home buyers were steered away from a racially integrated neighborhood and toward an all-white neighborhood, whereas black home buyers were steered away from the all-white neighborhood and toward the integrated neighborhood.  <i>Id.</i>, at 95.  The plaintiffs thus alleged that they were \xe2\x80\x9cdenied their right to select housing without regard to race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The village also sued, alleging that the FHA violations were affecting its \xe2\x80\x9cracial composition, replacing what is presently an integrated neighborhood with a segregated one\xe2\x80\x9d and that its budget was strained from resulting lost tax revenues.  <i>Id.</i>, at 110.  Finally, in <i>Havens</i>, one white and one black plaintiff sued after having posed as \xe2\x80\x9ctesters,\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9ccollecting evidence of unlawful steering practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373.  According to their complaint, the owner of an apartment complex had told the white plaintiff that apartments were available, but had told the black plaintiff that apartments were not.  <i>Id.</i>, at 368.  The Court held that the white plaintiff could <i>not </i>sue, because he had been provided truthful information, but that the black plaintiff <i>could </i>sue, because the FHA requires truthful information about housing without regard to race.  <i>Id.</i>, at 374\xe2\x80\x93375.  In all three of these cases, the plaintiffs claimed injuries based on racial steering and segregation\xe2\x80\x94interests that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, at least arguably fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Miami\xe2\x80\x99s asserted injuries implicate none of those interests.  Miami does not assert that it was injured based on efforts by the lenders to steer certain residents into one neighborhood rather than another.  Miami does not even assert that it was injured because its neighborhoods were segregated.  Miami therefore is not, as the majority describes, \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d to the plaintiffs in <i>Trafficante</i>, <i>Gladstone</i>, and <i>Havens</i>.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  Rather, Miami asserts injuries allegedly resulting from foreclosed-upon and then vacant homes.  The FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests is not so expansive as to include those kinds of injuries.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion, resting entirely on the brief mention in <i>Gladstone</i> of the village\xe2\x80\x99s asserted injury of reduced tax revenues, and on principles of <i>stare decisis</i>.  See <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>at 9.  I do not think <i>Gladstone</i> compels the conclusion the majority reaches.  Unlike these cases, <i>Gladstone </i>involved injuries to interests in \xe2\x80\x9cracial balance and stability,\xe2\x80\x9d 441 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111, which, our cases have suggested, arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by the FHA, see <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 6.  The fact that the village plaintiff asserted a budget-related injury <i>in addition to </i>its racial-steering injury does not mean that a city alleging <i>only </i>a budget-related injury is authorized to sue.  A budget-related injury might be necessary to establish a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury for purposes of Article III, but it is not sufficient to satisfy the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone-of-interests limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <i>Gladstone</i> is misplaced, its opinion today is notable primarily for what it does not say.  First, the Court conspicuously does not reaffirm the broad language from <i>Trafficante</i>, <i>Gladstone</i>, and <i>Havens</i> suggesting that Congress intended to permit any person with Article III standing to sue under the FHA.  The Court of Appeals felt bound by that language, see 800 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1277; 801 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1266, and we granted review, despite the absence of a circuit conflict, to decide whether the language survived <i>Thompson </i>and <i>Lexmark</i>, see Brief for Petitioner in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931111, p.\xc2\xa0i (\xe2\x80\x9cBy limiting suit to \xe2\x80\x98aggrieved person[s],\xe2\x80\x99 did Congress require that an FHA plaintiff plead more than just Article III injury-in-fact?\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioner in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931112, p.\xc2\xa0i (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether the term \xe2\x80\x98aggrieved\xe2\x80\x99 in the Fair Housing Act imposes a zone-of-interests requirement more stringent than the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III\xe2\x80\x9d).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion avoids those questions presented and thus cannot be read as retreating from our more recent precedents on the zone-of-interests limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court does not reject the lenders\xe2\x80\x99 arguments about many other kinds of injuries that fall outside of the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests.  We explained in <i>Thompson </i>that an expansive reading of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests would allow a shareholder \xe2\x80\x9cto sue a company for firing a valuable employee for racially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the value of his stock decreased as a consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 177<i>.  </i>Petitioners similarly argue that, if Miami can sue for lost tax revenues under the FHA, then \xe2\x80\x9cplumbers, utility companies, or any other participant in the local economy could sue the Banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up their homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory lending practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 8 (citing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 briefs).  The Court today decides that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not discuss\xe2\x80\x9d this argument because <i>Gladstone</i> and <i>stare decisis</i> compel the conclusion that Miami can sue.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 8.  That conclusion is wrong, but at least it is narrow.  Accordingly, it should not be read to authorize suits by local businesses alleging the same injuries that Miami alleges here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although I disagree with its zone-of-interests holding, I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions about proximate cause, as far as they go.  The Court correctly holds that \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 10.  Instead, the statute requires \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11 (quoting <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258,\n268 (1992)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After articulating this test for proximate cause, the Court remands to the Court of Appeals because it \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdraw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine on which side of the line the City\xe2\x80\x99s financial injuries fall.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 12.  But these cases come to the Court on a motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals has no advantage over us in evaluating the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s proximate-cause theory.  Moreover, the majority opinion leaves little doubt that neither Miami nor any similarly situated plaintiff can satisfy the rigorous standard for proximate cause that the Court adopts and leaves to the Court of Appeals to apply.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe general tendency in these cases, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Miami\xe2\x80\x99s own account of causation shows that the link between the alleged FHA violation and its asserted injuries is exceedingly attenuated.  According to Miami, the lenders\xe2\x80\x99 injurious conduct was \xe2\x80\x9ctarget[ing] black and Latino customers in Miami for predatory loans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931111, p. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And according to Miami, the injuries asserted are its \xe2\x80\x9closs of tax revenues\xe2\x80\x9d and its expenditure of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional monies on municipal services to address\xe2\x80\x9d the consequences of urban blight.  <i>Id.</i>, at 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As Miami describes it, the chain of causation between the injurious conduct and its asserted injuries proceeds as follows: As a result of the lenders\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory loan practices, borrowers from predominantly minority neighborhoods were likely to default on their home loans, leading to foreclosures.  <i>Id.</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  The foreclosures led to vacant houses.  <i>Id.</i>, at 6.  The vacant houses, in turn, led to decreased property values for the surrounding homes.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Finally, those decreased property values resulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes to the city government.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Also, Miami explains, the foreclosed-upon, vacant homes eventually led to \xe2\x80\x9cvagrancy, criminal activity, and threats to public health and safety,\xe2\x80\x9d which the city had to address through the expenditures of municipal resources.  <i>Ibid.</i>  And all this occurred, according to Miami, between 2004 and 2012.  See <i>ibid.</i>  The Court of Appeals will not need to look far to discern other, independent events that might well have caused the injuries Miami alleges in these cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of this attenuated chain of causation, Miami\xe2\x80\x99s asserted injuries are too remote from the injurious conduct it has alleged.  See <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519\n, n.\xc2\xa025 (1983).  Indeed, any other conclusion would lead to disquieting consequences.  Under Miami\xe2\x80\x99s own theory of causation, its injuries are one step further removed from the allegedly discriminatory lending practices than the injuries suffered by the neighboring homeowners whose houses declined in value.  No one suggests that those homeowners could sue under the FHA, and I think it is clear that they cannot.  Accordingly, I would hold that Miami has failed to sufficiently plead proximate cause under the FHA.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3727400">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-NOTICEOpinions">NOTICE:\xe2\x80\x82This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\xe2\x80\x83Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.</p>\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">Nos. 15\xe2\x80\x931111 and 15\xe2\x80\x931112</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-VideFirstLine">BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS</p>\n<p style="p-v">15\xe2\x80\x931111<i>v.</i></p>\n<p style="p-VideSecondLine">CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-VideFirstLine">WELLS FARGO &amp; CO., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS</p>\n<p style="p-v">15\xe2\x80\x931112<i>v.</i></p>\n<p style="p-VideSecondLine">CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[May 1, 2017]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) forbids</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ing] against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73604(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It further makes it unlawful for</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cany person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73605(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute allows any \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d to file a civil action seeking damages for a violation of the statute.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73613(a)(1)(A), 3613(c)(1).

The City claims that those practices violate the FHA and that it is entitled to damages for the listed injuries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Banks respond that the complaints do not set forth a cause of action for two basic reasons.  First, they contend that the City\xe2\x80\x99s claimed harms do not \xe2\x80\x9carguably\xe2\x80\x9d fall within the \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute seeks to protect, <i>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.</i> v. <i>Camp</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150,\n153 (1970)\n; hence, the City is not an \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d entitled to sue under the Act, \xc2\xa73602(i).  Second, they say that the complaint fails to draw a \xe2\x80\x9cproximate-cause\xe2\x80\x9d connection between the violation claimed and the harm allegedly suffered.  In their view, even if the City proves the violations it charges, the distance between those violations and the harms the City claims to have suffered is simply too great to entitle the City to collect damages.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We hold that the City\xe2\x80\x99s claimed injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects.  Hence, the City is an \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved person\xe2\x80\x9d able to bring suit under the statute.  We also hold that, to establish proximate cause under the FHA, a plaintiff must do more than show that its injuries foreseeably flowed from the alleged statutory violation.  The lower court decided these cases on the theory that foreseeability is all that the statute requires, so we vacate and remand for further proceedings.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 2013, the City of Miami brought lawsuits in federal court against two banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

App. 185\xe2\x80\x93197, 350\xe2\x80\x93362.  Those \xe2\x80\x9cpredatory\xe2\x80\x9d practices included, among others, excessively high interest rates, unjustified fees, teaser low-rate loans that overstated refinancing opportunities, large prepayment penalties, and\xe2\x80\x94when default loomed\xe2\x80\x94unjustified refusals to refinance or modify the loans.  <i>Id.,</i> at 225, 402.

But they do contend that those words nonetheless set boundaries that fall short of those the Constitution sets.  Brief for Petitioners in No.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x931112, p. 12 (Brief for Wells Fargo); Brief for Petitioners in No.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x931111, pp. 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (Brief for Bank of America).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s language in <i>Trafficante</i>, <i>Gladstone</i>, and <i>Havens Realty</i>, they argue, was exaggerated and unnecessary to decide the cases then before the Court.  See Brief for Wells Fargo 19\xe2\x80\x9323; Brief for Bank of America 27\xe2\x80\x9333.  Moreover, they warn that taking the Court\xe2\x80\x99s words literally\xe2\x80\x94providing everyone with constitutional standing a cause of action under the FHA\xe2\x80\x94would produce a legal anomaly.  After all, in <i>Thompson</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175\xe2\x80\x93177, we held that the words \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98person claiming to be aggrieved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the employment discrimination statute, did not stretch that statute\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interest to the limits of Article III.  We reasoned that such an interpretation would produce farfetched results, for example, a shareholder in a company could bring a Title VII suit against the company for discriminatorily firing an employee.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Banks say it would be similarly farfetched if restaurants, plumbers, utility companies, or any other participant in the local economy could sue the Banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up their homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory lending practices.  Brief for Wells Fargo 18\xe2\x80\x9319; Brief for Bank of America 22, 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  That, they believe, cannot have been the intent of the Congress that enacted or amended the FHA.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We need not discuss the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 argument at length, for even if we assume for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake that some form of it is valid, we nonetheless conclude that the City\xe2\x80\x99s financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.  Our case law with respect to the FHA drives that conclusion.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s complaints allege that the Banks \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally targeted predatory practices at African-American and Latino neighborhoods and residents,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 225; <i>id.,</i> at 409 (similar).  That unlawful conduct led to a \xe2\x80\x9cconcentration\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cforeclosures and vacancies\xe2\x80\x9d in those neighborhoods.  <i>Id.,</i> at 226, 229, 410, 413.  Those concentrated \xe2\x80\x9cforeclosures and vacancies\xe2\x80\x9d caused \xe2\x80\x9cstagnation and decline in African-American and Latino neighborhoods.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 225, 409.  They hindered the City\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to create integrated, stable neighborhoods.  <i>Id.,</i> at 186, 351.  And, highly relevant here, they reduced prop-erty values, diminishing the City\xe2\x80\x99s property-tax revenue and increasing demand for municipal services.  <i>Id.,</i> at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, 417.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Those claims are similar in kind to the claims the Village of Bellwood raised in <i>Gladstone</i>.  There, the plaintiff village had alleged that it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98injured by having [its] housing market .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. wrongfully and illegally manipulated to the economic and social detriment of the citizens of [the] village.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95 (quoting the complaint; alterations in original).  We held that the village could bring suit.  We wrote that the complaint in effect alleged that the defendant-realtors\xe2\x80\x99 racial steering \xe2\x80\x9caffect[ed] the village\xe2\x80\x99s racial composition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creduce[d] the total number of buyers in the Bellwood housing market,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprecipitate[d] an exodus of white residents,\xe2\x80\x9d and caused \xe2\x80\x9cprices [to] be deflected downward.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 110.  Those circumstances adversely affected the village by, among other things, <i>producing a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant reduction in property values [that] directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base, thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.\xe2\x80\x9d </i> <i>Id.,</i> at 110\xe2\x80\x93111 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that the City alleges economic injuries that arguably fall within the FHA\xe2\x80\x99s zone of interests, as we have previously interpreted that statute.  Principles of <i>stare decisis</i> compel our adherence to those precedents in this context.  And principles of statutory interpretation require us to respect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The remaining question is one of causation: Did the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly discriminatory lending practices proximately cause the City to lose property-tax revenue and spend more on municipal services?  The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d because the City plausibly alleged that its financial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct.  We conclude that foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA, and therefore vacate the judgment below.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98well established principle of [the common] law that in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lexmark</i>, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  We assume Congress \xe2\x80\x9cis familiar with the common-law rule and does not mean to displace it <i>sub silentio</i>\xe2\x80\x9d in federal causes of action.  <i>Ibid.</i>  A claim for damages under the FHA\xe2\x80\x94which is akin to a \xe2\x80\x9ctort action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Holley</i>,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280,\n285 (2003)\n\xe2\x80\x94is no exception to this traditional requirement.  \xe2\x80\x9cProximate-cause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory cause of action.  The question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lexmark</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In these cases, the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct the statute prohibits\xe2\x80\x9d consists of intentionally lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.  The City alleges that the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in specific Miami neighborhoods.  These foreclosures and vacancies purportedly harmed the City, which lost property-tax revenue when the value of the properties in those neighborhoods fell and was forced to spend more on municipal services in the affected areas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the City adequately pleaded that the Banks\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct proximately caused these financial injuries.  800 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1282.  The court held that in the context of the FHA \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper standard\xe2\x80\x9d for proximate cause \xe2\x80\x9cis based on foreseeability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1279, 1282.  The City, it continued, satisfied that element: Although there are \xe2\x80\x9cseveral links in the causal chain\xe2\x80\x9d between the charged discriminatory lending practices and the claimed losses, the City plausibly alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cnone are unforeseeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1282.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We conclude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that foreseeability is sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA.  As we have explained, proximate cause \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally bars suits for alleged harm that is \xe2\x80\x98too remote\xe2\x80\x99 from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lexmark</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 14).  In the context of the FHA, foreseeability alone does not ensure the close connection that proximate cause requires.  The housing market is interconnected with economic and social life.  A violation of the FHA may, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  far beyond the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct.  <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519,\n534 (1983)\n.  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a remedy wherever those ripples travel.  And entertaining suits to recover damages for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation would risk \xe2\x80\x9cmassive and complex damages litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 545.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires \xe2\x80\x9csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holmes </i>v.<i> Securities Investors Protection Corporation</i>,\n\n503 U. S. 258,\n268 (1992)\n.

What falls within that \xe2\x80\x9cfirst step\xe2\x80\x9d depends in part on the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the statutory cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lexmark</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 14), and an assessment \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of what is administratively possible and convenient,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Holmes</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 268.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> The parties have asked us to draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA and to determine on which side of the line the City\xe2\x80\x99s financial injuries fall.  We decline to do so.  The Eleventh Circuit grounded its decision on the theory that proximate cause under the FHA is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on foreseeability\xe2\x80\x9d alone.  800 F. 3d, at 1282.  We therefore lack the benefit of its judgment on how the contrary principles we have just stated apply to the FHA.  Nor has any other court of appeals weighed in on the issue.  The lower courts should define, in the first instance, the contours of proximate cause under the FHA and decide how that standard applies to the City\xe2\x80\x99s claims for lost property-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
