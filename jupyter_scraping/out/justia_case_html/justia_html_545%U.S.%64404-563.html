FELIX<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">MAYLE, WARDEN <em>v</em>. FELIX</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93563.Argued April 19, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 23, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Felix was convicted of murder and robbery in California state court and sentenced to life imprisonment.  His current application for federal habeas relief centers on two alleged trial-court errors, both involving the admission of out-of-court statements during the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s case-in-chief but otherwise unrelated.  Felix had made inculpatory statements during pretrial police interrogation.  He alleged that those statements were coerced, and that their admission violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  He also alleged that the admission of a videotape recording of testimony of a prosecution witness violated the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was affirmed on appeal and became final on August 12, 1997.  Under the one-year limitation period imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1), Felix had until August 12, 1998 to file a habeas petition in federal court.  On May 8, 1998, in a timely filed habeas petition, Felix asserted his Confrontation Clause challenge to admission of the videotaped prosecution witness testimony, but did not then challenge the admission of his own pretrial statements.  On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 1998 expiration of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limit and eight months after the court appointed counsel to represent him, Felix filed an amended petition asserting a Fifth Amendment objection to admission of his pretrial statements.  In response to the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Fifth Amendment claim was time barred, Felix asserted the rule that pleading amendments relate back to the filing date of the original pleading when both the original plea and the amendment arise out of the same \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth \xe2\x80\xa6 in the original pleading,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa015(c)(2).  Because his Fifth Amendment and Confrontation Clause claims challenged the constitutionality of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged, both claims arose out of the same \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time barred, and rejected the Confrontation Clause claim on its merits.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the latter claim, but reversed the dismissal of the coerced statements claim and remanded it for further proceedings.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d for Rule 15(c)(2) purposes was Felix\xe2\x80\x99s state-court trial and conviction.  Defining transaction with greater specificity, the court reasoned, would unduly strain the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d by dividing the trial and conviction into a series of individual occurrences.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0An amended habeas petition does not relate back (and thereby avoid AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year time limit) when it asserts a new ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those set forth in the original pleading.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1), a one-year limitation period applies to a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas application.  Habeas Corpus Rule 11 permits application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in habeas cases \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions or [the habeas] rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 2242 provides that habeas applications \xe2\x80\x9cmay be amended \xe2\x80\xa6 as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) allows pleading amendments with \xe2\x80\x9cleave of court\xe2\x80\x9d any time during a proceeding.  Before a responsive pleading is served, pleadings may be amended once as a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, without seeking court leave.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Amendments made after the statute of limitations has run relate back to the date of the original pleading if the original and amended pleadings \xe2\x80\x9car[i]se out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(c)(2).  The \xe2\x80\x9coriginal pleading\xe2\x80\x9d in a habeas proceeding is the petition as initially filed.  That pleading must \xe2\x80\x9cspecify all the grounds for relief available to the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstate the facts supporting each ground.\xe2\x80\x9d  Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c).  A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)\xe2\x80\x99s demand that petitioners plead with particularity is to assist the district court in determining whether the State should be ordered to \xe2\x80\x9cshow cause why the writ should not be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72243, or the petition instead should be summarily dismissed without ordering a responsive pleading.  Habeas Corpus Rule 4.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive definition of \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence,\xe2\x80\x9d virtually any new claim introduced in an amended habeas petition will relate back, for federal habeas claims, by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto.  The majority of Circuits define \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d in federal habeas cases far less broadly, allowing relation back only when the claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely filed claims, and not when the new claims depend upon events separate in both time and type from the originally raised episodes.  Under that view, Felix\xe2\x80\x99s own pretrial statements, newly raised in his amended petition, would not relate back because they were separated in time and type from the videotaped witness testimony.  This Court is not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings Rule 15 governs, of any reading of \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d as capacious as the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s construction for habeas cases.  Decisions applying Rule 15(c)(2) in the civil context illustrate that Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a common core of operative facts uniting the original and newly asserted claims.  The Court disagrees with Felix\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)\xe2\x80\x99s relation-back provision than was given the words \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Tiller</em> v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/574/index.html">323 U. S. 574</a>, 580\xe2\x80\x93581.  There, the amended complaint invoked a legal theory not suggested in the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.  Relation back was nevertheless permitted.  In <em>Tiller,</em> however, there was but one \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence,\xe2\x80\x9d the death of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s husband, which she attributed throughout to the respondent\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide a safe workplace.  In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes, the videotaped witness testimony in his original petition and his own interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the trial itself is the appropriate \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence\xe2\x80\x9d artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes those claims actionable in a habeas proceeding.  Although his self-incrimination claim did not ripen until the prosecutor introduced his pretrial statements at trial, the essential predicate for his Fifth Amendment claim was an extrajudicial event, <em>i.e.</em>, an out-of-court police interrogation.  The dispositive question in an adjudication of that claim would be the character of the police interrogation, specifically, did Felix answer voluntarily or were his statements coerced.  See <em>Haynes</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/503/index.html">373 U. S. 503</a>, 513\xe2\x80\x93514.  Under Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c)\xe2\x80\x99s particularity-in-pleading requirement, Felix\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause claim would be pleaded discretely, as would his self-incrimination claim.  Each separate congeries of facts supporting the grounds for relief, the Rule suggests, would delineate an \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Felix\xe2\x80\x99s and the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach is boundless by comparison, allowing a miscellany of claims for relief to be raised later rather than sooner and to relate back.  If claims asserted after the one-year period could be revived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period would have slim significance.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a firm check against petition amendments presenting new, discrete claims after AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period has run is provided by Rule 15(a)\xe2\x80\x94which gives district courts discretion to deny petition amendments once a responsive pleading has been filed\xe2\x80\x94overlooks a pleader\xe2\x80\x99s right to amend without leave of court \xe2\x80\x9cany time before a responsive pleading is served.\xe2\x80\x9d  That time can be long under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, pursuant to which a petition is not served until  the judge first examines it to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cit plainly appears \xe2\x80\xa6 that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading that relation back will be in order so long as the original and amended petitions state claims that are tied to a common core of operative facts is consistent with Rule 15(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s general application in civil cases, with Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), and with AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s tight time line for petitions.

Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa015(c)(2).</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jacoby Lee Felix, California prisoner and federal habeas petitioner, was convicted in California state court of first-degree murder and second-degree robbery, and received a life sentence.  Within the one-year limitation period AEDPA allows for habeas petitions, Felix filed a <em>pro se</em> petition in federal court.  He initially alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the admission into evidence of videotaped testimony of a witness for the prosecution violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.  Five months after the expiration of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limit, and eight months after the federal court appointed counsel to represent him, Felix filed an amended petition in which he added a new claim for relief: He asserted that, in the course of pretrial interrogation, the police used coercive tactics to obtain damaging statements from him, and that admission of those statements at trial violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  The question presented concerns the timeliness of Felix\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment claim.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In ordinary civil proceedings, the governing Rule, Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requires only \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa08(a)(2).  Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases requires a more detailed statement.  The habeas rule instructs the petitioner to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify all the grounds for relief available to [him]\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cstate the facts supporting each ground.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1">Footnote 1</a>]  By statute, Congress provided that a habeas petition \xe2\x80\x9cmay be amended \xe2\x80\xa6 as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72242.  The Civil Rule on amended pleadings, Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, instructs: \xe2\x80\x9cAn amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when \xe2\x80\xa6 the claim \xe2\x80\xa6 asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue before us is one on which federal appellate courts have divided: Whether, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2), Felix\xe2\x80\x99s amended petition, filed after AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year limitation and targeting his pretrial statements, relates back to the date of his original timely filed petition, which targeted the videotaped witness testimony.  Felix urges, and the Court of Appeals held, that the amended petition qualifies for relation back because both the original petition and the amended pleading arose from the same trial and conviction.  We reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment in this regard.  An amended habeas petition, we hold, does not relate back (and thereby escape AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year time limit) when it asserts a new ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those the original pleading set forth.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">I</p> <p style="text-align: left;"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995, after a jury trial in Sacramento, California, respondent Jacoby Lee Felix was found guilty of murder and robbery stemming from his participation in a carjacking in which the driver of the car was shot and killed.  App. E to Pet. for Cert. 2\xe2\x80\x937.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 1\xe2\x80\x932.  The current controversy centers on two alleged errors at Felix\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Both involve the admission of out-of-court statements during the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief, but the two are otherwise unrelated.  One prompted a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination objection originally raised in the trial court, the other, a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause challenge, also raised in the trial proceedings.  </p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment claim rested on the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of statements Felix made during pretrial police interrogation.  These statements were adduced at trial on direct examination of the investigating officer.  Felix urged that the police used coercive tactics to elicit the statements.  <em>Id.,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  His Sixth Amendment claim related to the admission of the videotaped statements prosecution witness Kenneth Williams made at a jailhouse interview.  The videotape records Williams, a friend of Felix, telling the police that he had overheard a conversation in which Felix described the planned robbery just before it occurred.  When Williams testified at trial that he did not recall the police interview, the trial court determined that Williams\xe2\x80\x99 loss of memory was feigned, and that the videotape was admissible because it contained prior inconsistent statements.  App. E to Pet. for Cert. 10\xe2\x80\x9313.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal, Felix urged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the admission of Williams\xe2\x80\x99 videotaped statements violated Felix\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.  He did not, however, argue that admission of his own pretrial statements violated his right to protection against self-incrimination.  The intermediate appellate court affirmed Felix\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence, <em>id.,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9313, 17, and the California Supreme Court denied his petition for review, App. F to Pet. for Cert. 2.

App. C to Pet. for Cert<em>.</em> 10.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year statute of limitations, Felix had until August 12, 1998 to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.  See \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Within the one-year period, on May 8, 1998, he filed a <em>pro se</em> petition for federal habeas relief.  Felix\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition repeated his Sixth Amendment objection to the admission of the Williams videotape, but he again failed to reassert the objection he made in the trial court to the admission of his own pretrial statements.  App. G to Pet. for Cert. 1\xe2\x80\x937.  On May 29, 1998, a Magistrate Judge appointed counsel to represent Felix.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 6; App. H to Pet. for Cert. 2.  Thereafter, on September 15, 1998, the Magistrate Judge ordered Felix to file an amended petition within 30 days.  <em>Id.,</em> at 3.  On Felix\xe2\x80\x99s unopposed requests, that period was successively extended.  <em>Id.,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Pending the filing of an amended petition, the State was not required to interpose an answer.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 1998 expiration of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time limit, and eight months after the appointment of counsel to represent him, Felix filed an amended petition.  <em>Id.,</em> at 5.  In this pleading, he reasserted his Confrontation Clause claim, and also asserted, for the first time post-trial, that his own pretrial statements to the police were coerced and therefore inadmissible at trial.  App. I to Pet. for Cert. 4<em>.</em>  Further, he alleged that his counsel on appeal to the California intermediate appellate court was ineffective in failing to raise the coerced confession claim on direct appeal.  <em>Id.,</em> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.[<a href="#F2">Footnote 2</a>]  In its answer to the amended petition, the State asserted that the Fifth Amendment claim was time barred because it was initially raised after the expiration of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s one-year limitation period.  Felix argued in response that the new claim related back to the date of his original petition.  Because both Fifth Amendment and Confrontation Clause claims challenged the constitutionality of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged, the Fifth Amendment claim arose out of the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth \xe2\x80\xa6 in the original pleading,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed.

Relation back was not in order, the Magistrate said, because Felix\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9callegedly involuntary statements to police d[id] not arise out of the same conduct, transaction or occurrence as the videotaped interrogation of [prosecution witness] Kenneth Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 16.  It did not suffice, the Magistrate observed, that Felix\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims attack the same criminal conviction.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Adopting the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and recommendation in full, the District Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time barred, and rejected the Confrontation Clause claim on its merits.  App. B to Pet. for Cert. 1\xe2\x80\x933.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of Felix\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause claim, but reversed the dismissal of his coerced statements claim and remanded that claim for further proceedings.  379 F.\xc2\xa03d 612 (2004).  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Rule 15(c)(2) was Felix\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrial and conviction in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 615.  Defining the transaction at any greater level of specificity, the majority reasoned, would \xe2\x80\x9cunduly strai[n] the usual meaning of \xe2\x80\x98conduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by dividing the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial and conviction [into] a series of perhaps hundreds of individual occurrences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Judge Tallman concurred in part and dissented in part.

Under that comprehensive definition, virtually any new claim introduced in an amended petition will relate back, for federal habeas claims, by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto.

As these decisions illustrate, Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a common \xe2\x80\x9ccore of operative facts\xe2\x80\x9d uniting the original and newly asserted claims.  See <em>Clipper Exxpress</em>, 690 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1259, n. 29; 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71497, p. 85 (2d ed. 1990).</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix asserts that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)\xe2\x80\x99s relation back provision than this Court gave to the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s key words \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Tiller</em> v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/574/index.html">323 U. S. 574</a>, 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (1945).  We disagree.  In <em>Tiller</em>, a railroad worker was struck and killed by a railroad car.  His widow sued under the Federal Employers Liability Act, 45 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa751 <em>et seq</em>., to recover for his wrongful death.  She initially alleged various negligent acts.  In an amended complaint, she added a claim under the Federal Boiler Inspection Act for failure to provide the train\xe2\x80\x99s locomotive with a rear light.  We held that the amendment related back, and therefore avoided a statute of limitations bar, even though the amendment invoked a legal theory not suggested by the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was but one episode-in-suit in <em>Tiller</em>, a worker\xe2\x80\x99s death attributed from the start to the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide its employee with a reasonably safe place to work.  The federal rulemakers recognized that personal injury plaintiffs often cannot pinpoint the precise cause of an injury prior to discovery.  See 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71215, pp. 138\xe2\x80\x93143 (2d ed. 1990).  They therefore included in the Appendix to the Federal Rules an illustrative form indicating that a personal injury plaintiff could adequately state a claim for relief simply by alleging that the defendant negligently operated a certain instrumentality at a particular time and place.  See Form 9, Complaint for Negligence, Forms App., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc., 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 829.  The widow in <em>Tiller</em> met that measure.  She based her complaint on a single \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence,\xe2\x80\x9d an accident resulting in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death.  In contrast, Felix targeted separate episodes, the pretrial police interrogation of witness Williams in his original petition, his own interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix contends, however, that his amended petition qualifies for relation back because the trial itself is the \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence\xe2\x80\x9d that counts.  See Brief for Respondent 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  Citing <em>Chavez</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/760/index.html">538 U. S. 760</a> (2003) (plurality opinion), Felix urges that neither the videotaped interview with witness Williams nor the pretrial police interrogation to which Felix himself was exposed transgressed any constitutional limitation.  Until the statements elicited by the police were introduced at trial, Felix argues, he had no actionable claim at all.  Both the confrontation right he timely presented and the privilege against self-incrimination he asserted in his amended petition are \xe2\x80\x9ctrial right[s],\xe2\x80\x9d Felix underscores.  Brief for Respondent 21 (emphasis deleted).  His claims based on those rights, he maintains, are not \xe2\x80\x9cseparate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 22; rather, they are related in time and type, for \xe2\x80\x9cthey arose on successive days during the trial and both challenged [on constitutional grounds] admission of pretrial statements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.</p> <p>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes them actionable in a habeas proceeding.   We do not here question his assertion that his Fifth Amendment right did not ripen until his statements were admitted against him at trial.  See <em>Chavez</em>, 538 U. S., at 766\xe2\x80\x93767.  Even so, the essential predicate for his self-incrimination claim was an extrajudicial event, <em>i.e.</em>, an out-of-court police interrogation.  The dispositive question in an adjudication of that claim would be the character of Felix\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, not in court, but at the police interrogation, specifically, did he answer voluntarily or were his statements coerced.  See <em>Haynes</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/503/index.html">373 U.

Under that Rule, once a responsive pleading has been filed, a prisoner may amend the petition \xe2\x80\x9conly by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(a); see <em>Ellzey </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 521, 526 (CA7 2003) (AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s aim to \xe2\x80\x9cexpedite resolution of collateral attacks \xe2\x80\xa6 should influence the exercise of discretion under Rule 15(a)\xe2\x80\x94which gives the district judge the right to disapprove proposed amendments that would unduly prolong or complicate the case.\xe2\x80\x9d).  This argument overlooks a pleader\xe2\x80\x99s right to amend without leave of court \xe2\x80\x9cany time before a responsive pleading is served.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 15(a).  In federal habeas cases that time can be rather long, as indeed it was in the instant case.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, a petition is not immediately served on the respondent.  The judge first examines the pleading to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cit plainly appears \xe2\x80\xa6 that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Only if the petition survives that preliminary inspection will the judge \xe2\x80\x9corder the respondent to file an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the interim, the petitioner may amend his pleading \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d as Felix did in this very case.

The concern is understandable, although we note that in Felix\xe2\x80\x99s case, counsel was appointed, and had some two and a half months to amend the petition before AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period expired.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  That was ample time to add a claim based on the alleged pretrial extraction of damaging statements from Felix.

I see nothing in habeas law or practice that calls for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s narrow construction of the rule, and good reasons to go the other way, including the unfortunate consequence that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view creates an unfair disparity between indigent habeas petitioners and those able to afford their own counsel.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, there is need for care in understanding the narrow scope of the problem this case presents.  A habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to amend as a matter of course, without permission of the trial court, exists only before the responsive pleading is served, and even then only once.  Rule 15(a).  After one amendment, or after the government files the answer or other response, assuming one is even required, see Habeas Corpus Rule 4, the prisoner may not amend without the court\xe2\x80\x99s leave or the government\xe2\x80\x99s consent, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a).  While leave to amend \xe2\x80\x9cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, justice does, after all, have to require it, and the District Courts will presumably say no, for example, in the face of unjustifiable delay or threatened prejudice to the State.  See <em>Foman</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/178/index.html">371 U. S. 178</a>, 182 (1962); see also Brief for Professor Arthur R. Miller et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (describing reasons courts regularly deny leave to amend and citing cases); 6 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71487\xe2\x80\x931488 (2d ed. 1990) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (discussing reasons leave to amend may be and often is denied, including delay and prejudice).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern for \xe2\x80\x9cunconstrained\xe2\x80\x9d recourse to petition amendments, <em>ante</em>, at 16, is thus misplaced.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limited opportunity to amend also supplies perspective on the claim that Felix\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the relation back rule would undermine the 1-year limitation period of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s concomitant concern for finality of judgments.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  In fact, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives bear little weight in the analysis, because the very point of every relation back rule is to qualify a statute of limitations, and Rule 15(c) \xe2\x80\x9cis based on the notion that once litigation involving particular conduct or a given transaction or occurrence has been instituted, the parties are not entitled to the protection of the statute of limitations against the later assertion by amendment of defenses or claims that arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as set forth in the original pleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  6A Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa71496, at 64.  That AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, like any other, may be trumped by relating back when the subject of the amendment arises out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence described in the original pleading, does not alone help us to figure out what conduct, transaction, or occurrence is the same.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Felix\xe2\x80\x99s disputed right to amend with relation back effect turns entirely, as the Court says, <em>ante</em>, at 9, on how narrowly or how broadly the tripartite authorization for relation back ought to be construed: whether the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] to which a habeas petition refers includes the underlying trial (which resulted in the custody being challenged) or is limited to the set of facts underlying each trial ruling claimed to be constitutionally defective (in this case, the unconfronted videotaped testimony and the interrogation that produced the incriminating statement).  If the former, a habeas petitioner will have the benefit of relation back for any amendment raising trial error, subject to the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to deny leave except for the one amendment of right; if the latter, a petitioner is effectively precluded from making any amendment unless a single trial ruling amounts to distinct errors or an underlying fact is the subject of distinct rulings, notwithstanding Congress\xe2\x80\x99s evident intent to provide relation back in habeas proceedings, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72242; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Habeas Corpus Rule 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text alone does not tell us the answer, for either the facts specific to the claim or the trial as a whole could be the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court assumes that the former approach is correct and then proceeds to explain, based on that assumption, the infirmity of a contrary approach.  For example, the Court asserts that under Felix\xe2\x80\x99s rule, \xe2\x80\x9call manner of factually and temporally unrelated conduct may be raised after the statute of limitations has run \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa06.  But in saying this the Court presumes that the relevant transaction is what occurred outside the courtroom.  Felix\xe2\x80\x99s entire argument is that the proper transaction is instead what occurred in court, namely the imposition of the conviction that justifies the challenged custody.  If he is right, then the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is incorrect, for what Felix seeks to add is a claim not about \xe2\x80\x9cfactually and temporally unrelated conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, but about conduct that occurred at the same trial as the conduct addressed in the initial petition.  That newly addressed conduct will hardly be \xe2\x80\x9ctemporally unrelated\xe2\x80\x9d to what was previously targeted; it likely will have occurred on the same day of trial as the original conduct or within a few days.  Nor will it be \xe2\x80\x9cfactually \xe2\x80\xa6 unrelated\xe2\x80\x9d to the previously raised in-court conduct, for it will almost certainly involve the same judge, the same parties and attorneys, the same courtroom, and the same jurors.  Again, my point is just that much of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument lacks force because it assumes that the proper transaction is what occurred outside the courtroom rather than inside, when that is the question we must answer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Court also cautions that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be anomalous to allow relation back under Rule 15(c)(2) based on a broader reading of the words \xe2\x80\x98conduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x99 in federal habeas proceedings than in ordinary civil litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  The cases the Court cites to establish the scope of civil relation back, however, see <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313, simply stand for the proposition that an amendment relates back only if it deals with the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.  Felix does not purport to claim anything more.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At first glance, an argument for the narrow reading urged by petitioner Mayle inheres in the distinctive pleading requirement for habeas petitions.  Unlike the generous notice-pleading standard for the benefit of ordinary civil plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), see <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a>, 47 (1957), Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c) requires habeas petitioners to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify all the grounds for relief available,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cstate the facts supporting each ground.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court implies that because pleading must be factually specific, the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) must be specifically factual to a parallel degree; as the Court puts it, a habeas petitioner will plead claims \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretely,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14, such that each ground for relief \xe2\x80\x9cwould delineate an \xe2\x80\x98occurrence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.  But this does not follow; all that follows from \xe2\x80\x9cdiscret[e]\xe2\x80\x9d pleading is that each claim would delineate a separate ground for relief, whatever may be the conduct, transaction, or occurrence out of which the claims arise.  As <em>Tiller</em> v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/574/index.html">323 U. S. 574</a> (1945), and the other civil cases the Court cites demonstrate, see <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, relation back is regularly allowed when an amendment raises a separate claim for relief arising out of the same transaction or occurrence, no matter how discretely that claim might be stated.  Indeed, this is what the text anticipates; Rule 15(c)(2) permits relation back when \xe2\x80\x9cthe claim or defense\xe2\x80\x9d asserted in the amendment arises out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original pleading.  That is, the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence can support multiple, discrete claims for relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any policy underlying the particular habeas pleading rule that requires a more grudging relation back standard.  As the Court concedes, <em>ante</em>, at 9, the purpose of the heightened pleading standard in habeas cases is to help a district court weed out frivolous petitions before calling upon the State to answer.  See Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Note on Habeas Corpus Rule 2, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C., p. 469; Advisory Committee Note on Rule 4, <em>id.,</em> at 471 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is the duty of the court to screen out frivolous applications and eliminate the burden that would be placed on the respondent by ordering an unnecessary answer\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 R.

Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa711.6, p. 573, n.\xc2\xa03 (4th ed. 2001) (hereinafter Hertz &amp; Liebman) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]act pleading, like other habeas corpus rules and practices, enables courts \xe2\x80\xa6 to separate substantial petitions from insubstantial ones quickly and without need of adversary proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); Note, Developments in the Law\xe2\x80\x94Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1038, 1175 (1970) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe justification for stringent pleading requirements in habeas corpus is thought to lie in the need to protect the courts from the burden of entertaining frivolous applications\xe2\x80\x9d).  Identifying meritless claims has nothing to do with the effect of amendment to initial petitions for relief, except in the remote sense that an amendment will require a district judge to examine one more item.  But there is no claim here that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) has to be narrow to protect judges; the government is objecting because it wants fewer claims to defend, and that objection is unrelated to the habeas fact-pleading standard.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While considerations based on habeas pleading fail to pan out with support for Mayle\xe2\x80\x99s restricted reading of Rule 15(c), several reasons convince me that Felix\xe2\x80\x99s reading is right.  Most obvious is the fact that both of his claims can easily fit within the same \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction or occurrence,\xe2\x80\x9d understood as a trial ending in conviction resulting in a single ultimate injury of unlawful custody.  (\xe2\x80\x9cConduct\xe2\x80\x9d sounds closer to underlying facts, perhaps, but Rule 15(c) turns on either conduct, transaction, or occurrence.)  The Court acknowledges that Felix\xe2\x80\x99s claims regarding his own interrogation and the videotaped testimony of witness Kenneth Williams are potentially actionable here only because the resulting incriminating statements were introduced at trial, <em>ante</em>, at 14, but argues that they nevertheless arise out of separate transactions or occurrences because they rest on distinct \xe2\x80\x9cessential predicate[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., meaning pretrial acts.  It is certainly true that the claims depend on those distinct pretrial acts, but the claims depend equally on the specified trial errors, without which there would be no habeas claim: without the introduction of each set of statements at trial, Felix would have no argument for habeas relief, regardless of what happened outside of court.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s own opinion demonstrates this, as its descriptions of Felix\xe2\x80\x99s two claims refer not only to what happened outside court but also to what happened at trial, and they specifically ground the alleged constitutional violations on the latter.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cHe initially alleged \xe2\x80\xa6 that the admission into evidence of videotaped testimony of a witness for the prosecution violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cHe asserted that, in the course of pretrial interrogation, the police used coercive tactics to obtain damaging statements from him, and that admission of those statements at trial violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Moreover, habeas review will of course look at more of the underlying trial record than just the ruling admitting the disputed evidence, for Felix\xe2\x80\x99s claims like a great many others will call for examining the trial record as a whole for signs of requisite prejudice or reversible error.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Here, for example, if a court were to conclude that introducing Felix\xe2\x80\x99s statements did violate the Fifth Amendment, relief would still turn on whether the error was harmless.  This would call for a careful look at the other evidence admitted at trial, including the statements said to have come in contrary to the Confrontation Clause.  In sum, Felix\xe2\x80\x99s claims are not outside the text of Rule 15(c)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then there are a number of indications that Congress would not want the rule read narrowly, the first centering on the word \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  That term not only goes to the breadth of relation back, but also to the scope of claim preclusion.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Kremer</em> v. <em>Chemical Constr. Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/index.html">456 U. S. 461</a>, 482, n. 22 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cRes judicata has recently been taken to bar claims arising from the same transaction even if brought under different statutes \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); accord, 1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa724(1) (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he claim extinguished includes all rights \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose\xe2\x80\x9d).  For purposes of claim preclusion in habeas cases, the scope of \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d is crucial in applying AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on second or successive petitions: with very narrow exceptions, federal habeas limits a prisoner to only one petition challenging his conviction or sentence.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b)(1).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The provisions limiting second or successive habeas petitions regard the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of habeas claim preclusion as the trial that yielded the conviction or sentence under attack; once a challenge to that conviction or sentence has been rejected, other challenges are barred even if they raise different claims.  By contrast, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of Rule 15(c) that the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d is the facts or conduct underlying each discrete claim, a prisoner should be allowed to file a second habeas petition so long as it is based on different underlying facts or conduct (<em>i.e.</em>, on what the Court considers a separate \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court thus adopts, for purposes of relation back in habeas cases, a definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d different from the one Congress apparently intended for purposes of claim preclusion in habeas cases.  Judge Easterbrook explained this tension in <em>Ellzey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 521 (CA7 2003), and the Court offers no evidence that Congress would have decreed any such apparent anomaly within the body of habeas standards.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, rather, a fair indication that Congress would have intended otherwise, in the fact that it has already placed limits on the right of some habeas petitioners to amend their petitions.  In Chapter 154 of Title 28, providing special procedures for habeas cases brought by petitioners subject to capital sentences in certain States, Congress specifically prohibited amendment of the original habeas petitions after the filing of the answer, except on the grounds specified for second or successive petitions under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b).  See \xc2\xa72266(b)(3)(B).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent to limit capital petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to amend (and thus to take advantage of relation back) makes sense owing to capital petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 incentive for delay, but the provision it enacted also helps us make sense of Rule 15(c) in the usual habeas case where a prisoner has no incentive to string the process out.  For Congress has shown not only that it knows how to limit amendment in habeas cases, but also that it specifically considered the subject of limiting amendment in such cases and chose not to limit amendment in the ordinary ones.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final reason to view the trial as the relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 15(c)(2) lies in the real consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, which will fall most heavily on the shoulders of indigent habeas petitioners who can afford no counsel without the assistance of the court.  In practical terms, the significance of the right to amend arises from the fact that in the overwhelming majority of cases, the original petition is the work of a <em>pro se</em> petitioner.  See <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 191 (2001) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (93% of habeas petitioners in study were <em>pro se</em> (citing U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging State Court Criminal Convictions 14 (1995))); 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, \xc2\xa712.2, at 601 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]early all\xe2\x80\x9d federal habeas petitioners commence proceedings either without legal assistance or with only the aid of a fellow inmate or a volunteer attorney).  Unless required by statute, appointment of counsel is most often a matter of discretion on the part of the court.  The district judge may well choose not to exercise that discretion unless and until a habeas proceeding advances to the stage of discovery or evidentiary hearing.  See Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) (requiring appointment of counsel for indigent petitioner \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f necessary for effective discovery\xe2\x80\x9d); Rule 8(c) (requiring appointment of counsel \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f an evidentiary hearing is warranted\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the judge almost certainly will not appoint counsel until after the preliminary review of the petition to see whether it plainly warrants dismissal.  See Rule 4.  Where a petition (even in its <em>pro se </em>form) has survived this review by showing enough merit to justify appointing counsel, it makes no sense to say that counsel (appointed because of that apparent merit) should be precluded from exercising professional judgment when that judgment calls for adding a new ground for relief that would relate back to the filing of the original petition.  For by hobbling counsel this way, the Court limits the capacity of appointed counsel to provide the professional service that a paid lawyer, hired at the outset, can give a client.  The lawyer hired at the start of the proceeding will be able to draft an original petition containing all the claims revealed to his trained eye; if the same lawyer is appointed by the court only after the petitioner has demonstrated some merit in an original <em>pro se</em> filing, he and his prisoner client will have no right to state all claims by adding to the original petition, unless the lawyer happens to be appointed and able to get up to speed before the statute of limitations runs out.  The rule the Court adopts today may not make much difference to prisoners with enough money to hire their own counsel; but it will matter a great deal to poor prisoners who need appointed counsel to see and plead facts showing a colorable basis for relief.

But as just noted, those \xe2\x80\x9coperative facts\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, the relevant transaction) consisted of a number of separate protests filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission over a period of two years, each in response to a different proposed tariff amendment.  This is, to say the least, a rather expansive transaction, much more so in my view than a single trial involving (for all claims stemming from it) the same judge, the same parties, the same attorneys, the same jury, the same indictment, and so on.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Neither does the warning on the model habeas petition (that failure to set forth every ground for relief may preclude the presentation of additional grounds later) tell us anything about relation back.  The Court implies that it does, <em>ante</em>, at 9, but the language on the form says nothing about relation back, and if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s implication were correct then the warning would also bar amendments filed within the limitations period.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0By contrast, use at trial of the fruits of the alleged police misconduct would not be a prerequisite to success in an action under Rev.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis thus lies in some tension with our understanding that the signal, defining feature setting habeas cases apart from other tort claims against the State is that they \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily demonstrat[e] the invalidity of the conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Heck</em> v. <em>Humphrey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/477/index.html">512 U.
