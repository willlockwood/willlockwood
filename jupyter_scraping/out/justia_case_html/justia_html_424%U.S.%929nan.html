United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html">418 U.S. 87</a> (1974), this Court held that federal obscenity prosecutions did not require proof of a uniform national standard of obscenity and that a juror sitting on a federal obscenity case was permitted to draw on the knowledge of the community from which he came \'in deciding what conclusion \'the average person applying contemporary community standards\' would reach in a given case.\'Id., at 105. Here, however, the State of Oregon, at the time of petitioners\' trial, had no policy prohibiting the distribution of obscene materials, unless minors are involved. This case, therefore, raises the important question whether a uniform national standard should be applied in the circumstance. Decision of that question certainly merits plenary consideration and oral argument. </p><p> In these circumstances, I have no occasion to consider whether the other question presented by petitioners merits plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 494, 495 (1974) ( Brennan, J., dissenting).\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
