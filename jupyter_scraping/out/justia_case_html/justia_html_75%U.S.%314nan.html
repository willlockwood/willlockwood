It also contained some ten or twelve prayers for instructions by the plaintiff which were refused by the court as rulings of law which relate to the validity of plaintiff\'s title; also, an instruction given by the court to the effect that the patent of the United States to Mrs. McRee invested her with the title which her deed transferred to the plaintiff, and that the patent having issued within the ten years next preceding the commencement of the suit, the statute of limitations could not be relied on as a bar.</p>\n<p>On this record the case was carried to the supreme court of the state, where it was "affirmed in all things" on December </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 75 U.

JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The record presented to the Supreme Court questions the validity of Mrs. McRee\'s title, the transfer of her title to plaintiff, the trust asserted by which plaintiff\'s title enured to the benefit of defendants, and the statute of limitations.  On all these the court below must have found for plaintiff, for such a finding was essential to his recovery.  The first judgment of the supreme court affirming the judgment of the Land Court must also have found all these issues for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>We are asked now to hold that the second judgment of the supreme court, which reversed that of the Land Court, was founded on the question of limitation.  If we look to the language used in the judgment of the court in setting aside its judgment of affirmance and granting a rehearing, or in the final judgment of reversal, we can see nothing to justify that inference.</p>\n<p>This Court has decided in the case of <em>Rector v. Ashley,</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] following <em>Williams v. Norris,</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] that the opinion of the court cannot be resorted to for the purpose of showing that a question of federal cognizance was decided by the state court.  In the present case, it is said that the application for a rehearing was based exclusively on the question of the statute of limitation.  That which is here called a motion for a rehearing is merely an argument of counsel setting forth numerous decisions of the courts and many reasons of counsel why the statute should be held to be a bar, and it insists that this question had not received sufficient attention at the hands of the court.  It is not easy to see how this argument can be regarded as a part of the record of the case.  It can </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 75 U. S. 318</a></p><p> have no better claim to be so regarded than the opinion of the court, which accompanies the record.</p>\n<p>If, however, it could be treated as part of the record, it affords no conclusive evidence that the rehearing was granted on that ground.</p>\n<p>But if we could infer that the rehearing was granted because the court was of opinion that it had not well considered that question, it is to be remembered that the reargument took place four months afterwards, that there is nothing to show what might then have been presented by counsel on either side or what might have been considered by the court, for the case was fully opened, by setting aside the former judgment, to every consideration which could rightfully influence the decision.  It is hardly a reasonable inference, under these circumstances, that the court did decide the case on the question of the statute of limitation, and certainly it does not appear that the case was necessarily decided on that question, or that the proposition was essential to the judgment.</p>\n<p>It is our opinion, therefore, that under the repeated decisions of this Court, this record presents no case of which we have jurisdiction. The writ of error is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/73/142/case.html">73 U.
