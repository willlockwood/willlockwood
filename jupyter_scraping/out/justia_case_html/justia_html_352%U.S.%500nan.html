S. 501</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A jury in the Circuit Court of St. Louis awarded damages to the petitioner in this action under the Federal Employers\' Liability Act. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed upon the ground that the petitioner\'s evidence did not support the finding of respondent\'s liability. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  This Court granted certiorari to consider the question whether the decision invaded the jury\'s function. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner was a laborer in a section gang, working on July 17, 1951, along a portion of respondent\'s double-track line which, near Garner, Arkansas, runs generally north and south.  The tracks are on ballast topping the surface of a dirt "dump" with sloping sides, and there is a path about a yard wide bordering each side of the surface between the crest of the slope and the edge of the ballast.  Weeds and vegetation, killed chemically preparatory to burning them off, covered the paths and slopes.  Petitioner\'s foreman assigned him to burn off the weeds and vegetation -- the first time he was given that task in the two months he had worked for the respondent.  He testified that it was customary to burn off such vegetation with a flame thrower operated from a car running on the tracks.  Railroad witnesses testified, however, that the respondent discontinued the use of flame throwers at least </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 352 U. S. 502</a></p><p> a year earlier because the fires started by them sometimes spread beyond the railroad right of way.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was supplied with a crude hand torch and was instructed to burn off the weeds and vegetation along the west path and for two or three feet down the west slope.  The events leading to his mishap occurred after he proceeded with the work to a point within thirty to thirty-five years of a culvert adjoining the path.</p>\n<p>Petitioner testified, without contradiction, that the foreman instructed him and other members of the section gang to stop what they were doing when a train passed and to take positions off the tracks and ties to observe in journals of the passing train for hotboxes.  The instructions were explicit not to go on either of the tracks or to stand on or near the ends of the ties when a train was passing on a far track.  This was a safety precaution, because "the sound of one train would deaden the sound of another one that possibly would come from the other way."</p>\n<p>On this day, petitioner heard the whistle of a train which was approaching from behind him on the east track.  He promptly "quit firing" and ran north to a place on the path near the mentioned culvert.  He was standing a few feet from the culvert observing the train for hotboxes when he became enveloped in smoke and flames.  The passing train had fanned the flames of the burning vegetation and weeds, carrying the fire to the vegetation around his position.  He threw his arm over his face, retreated quickly back on the culvert and slipped and fell from the top of the culvert, suffering the serious injuries for which he sought damages in this suit.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges negligence in that petitioner was</p>\n<p>"required to work at a place in close proximity to defendant\'s railroad tracks, whereon trains moved and passed, causing the fire from said burning weeds and the smoke therefrom to come dangerously close to plaintiff and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 352 U. S. 503</a></p><p> requiring plaintiff to move away from said danger."</p>\n<p>Negligence was also alleged in that the surface of the culvert was not properly maintained because, instead of the usual flat surface giving firm footing for workmen, the surface was</p>\n<p>"covered with loose and sloping gravel which did not provide adequate or sufficient footing for plaintiff to thus move or work under the circumstances."</p>\n<p>We think that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding for the petitioner.  The testimony that the burning off of weeds and vegetation was ordinarily done with flame throwers from cars on the tracks and not, as here, by a workman on foot using a crude hand torch, when that evidence is considered with the uncontradicted testimony that the petitioner was where he was on this narrow path atop the dirt "dump" in furtherance of explicit orders to watch for hotboxes, supplied ample support for a jury finding that respondent\'s negligence played a part in the petitioner\'s injury.  These were probative facts from which the jury could find that respondent was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that petitioner, in performing the duties required of him, would suffer just such an injury as he did. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Common experience teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames of a fire and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the danger and, in the process, pay scant heed to other dangers which may imperil him.  In this view, it was an irrelevant consideration whether the immediate reason for his slipping off the culvert was the presence of gravel negligently allowed by respondent to remain on the surface or was some cause not identified from the evidence.</p>\n<p>The Missouri Supreme Court based its reversal upon its finding of an alleged admission by the petitioner that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 352 U. S. 504</a></p><p> he knew it was his primary duty to watch the fire.  From that premise, the Missouri court reasoned that petitioner was inattentive to the fire, and that the emergency which confronted him "was an emergency brought about by himself." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It said that if, as petitioner testified, the immediate cause of his fall was that loose gravel on the surface of the culvert rolled out from under him, yet it was his inattention to the fire which caused it to spread and obliged petitioner "to move blindly away and fall," and this was "something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel at the culvert." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>We interpret the foregoing to mean that the Missouri court found as a matter of law that the petitioner\'s conduct was the sole cause of his mishap.  But, when the petitioner agreed that his primary duty was to watch the fire, he did not also say that he was relieved of the duty to stop to watch a passing train for hotboxes.  Indeed, no witness testified that the instruction was countermanded.  At best, uncertainty as to the fact arises from the petitioner\'s testimony, and, in that circumstance, not the court, but the jury, was the tribunal to determine the fact.</p>\n<p>We may assume that the jury could properly have reached the court\'s conclusion.  But, as the probative facts also supported with reason the verdict favorable to the petitioner, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the decision was exclusively for the jury to make. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The jury was instructed to return a verdict for the respondent if it was found that negligence of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 352 U. S. 505</a></p><p> the petitioner was the sole cause of his mishap. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We must take it that the verdict was obedient to the trial judge\'s charge, and that the jury found that such was not the case, but that petitioner\'s injury resulted at least in part from the respondent\'s negligence.</p>\n<p>The opinion may also be read as basing the reversal on another ground, namely, that it appeared to the court that the petitioner\'s conduct was at least as probable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the respondent, and that, in such case, there was no case for the jury.  But that would mean that there is no jury question in actions under this statute, although the employee\'s proofs support </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 352 U. S. 506</a></p><p> with reason a verdict in his favor, unless the judge can say that the jury may exclude the idea that his injury was due to causes with which the defendant was not connected, or, stated another way, unless his proofs are so strong that the jury, on grounds of probability, may exclude a conclusion favorable to the defendant.  That is not the governing principle defining the proof which requires a submission to the jury in these cases.  The Missouri court\'s opinion implies its view that this is the governing standard by saying that the proofs must show that "the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence" of his employer, and that "[t]he test of whether there is causal connection is that, absent the negligent act, the injury would not have occurred." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  That is language of proximate causation which makes a jury question dependent upon whether the jury may find that the defendant\'s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.</p>\n<p>Under this statute, the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that enployer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, including the employee\'s contributory negligence. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 352 U. S. 507</a></p><p> appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Judges are to fix their sights primarily to make that appraisal and, if that test is met, are bound to find that a case for the jury is made out whether or not the evidence allows the jury a choice of other probabilities.  The statute expressly imposes liability upon the employer to pay damages for injury or death due "in whole or <em>in part</em>" to its negligence. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The law was enacted because the Congress was dissatisfied with the common law duty of the master to his servant. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The statute supplants that duty with the far more drastic duty of paying damages for injury or death at work due in whole or in part to the employer\'s negligence.  The employer is stripped of his common law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 352 U. S. 508</a></p><p> defenses and, for practical purposes, the inquiry in these cases today rarely presents more than the single question whether negligence of the employer played any part, however small, in the injury or death which is the subject of the suit. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The burden of the employee is met, and the obligation of the employer to pay damages arises, when there is proof, even though entirely circumstantial, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] from which the jury may with reason make that inference.</p>\n<p>The Congress, when adopting the law, was particularly concerned that the issues whether there was employer fault and whether that fault played any part in the injury or death of the employee should be decided by the jury whenever fair-minded men could reach these conclusions on the evidence. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Originally, judicial administration of the 1908 Act substantially limited the cases in which employees were allowed a jury determination.  That was because the courts developed concepts of assumption of risk [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] and of the coverage of the law, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] which defeated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 352 U. S. 509</a></p><p> employee claims as a matter of law.  Congress corrected this by the 1939 amendments, and removed the fetters which hobbled the full play of the basic congressional intention to leave to the factfinding function of the jury the decision of the primary question raised in these cases -- whether employer fault played any part in the employee\'s mishap. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Cognizant of the duty to effectuate the intention of the Congress to secure the right to a jury determination, this Court is vigilant to exercise its power of review in any case where it appears that the litigants have been improperly deprived of that determination. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Some say the Act has shortcomings, and would prefer a workmen\'s compensation scheme.  The fact that Congress has not seen fit to substitute that scheme cannot relieve this Court of its obligation to effectuate the present congressional intention by granting certiorari to correct instances of improper administration of the Act and to prevent its erosion by narrow and niggardly construction.  Similarly, once certiorari is granted, the fact that the case arises under the Federal Employers\' Liability Act cannot in any wise justify a failure on our part to afford the litigants the same measure of review on the merits as in every other case. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The kind of misconception evidenced in the opinion below, which fails to take into account the special features of this statutory negligence action that make it significantly different from the ordinary common law negligence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 352 U. S. 510</a></p><p> action, has required this Court to review a number of cases. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  In a relatively large percentage of the cases reviewed, the Court has found that lower courts have not given proper scope to this integral part of the congressional scheme.  We reach the same conclusion in this case. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The decisions of this Court after the 1939 amendments teach that the Congress vested the power of decision in these actions exclusively in the jury in all but the infrequent cases [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] where fair-minded jurors cannot honestly differ whether fault of the employer played any part in the employee\'s injury.  Special and important reasons for the grant of certiorari in these cases are certainly present when lower federal and state courts persistently deprive litigants of their right to a jury determination. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 352 U.
