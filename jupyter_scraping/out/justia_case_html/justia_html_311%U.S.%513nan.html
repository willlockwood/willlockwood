JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a companion case to <em>Helvering v.

S. 504</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The question is whether the loss suffered by petitioner on foreclosure sale of his mortgaged property, acquired for profit, may be deducted in full from gross income, or only to the extent provided by \xc2\xa7 117(d) of the 1934 Revenue Act.  The statutory provisions involved are those of the 1934 Act relating to capital gains or losses, particularly "losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets," considered in the <em>Hammel</em> case, which are made applicable to petitioner, a corporation, by \xc2\xa7 23(f), (j). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 311 U. S. 514</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that petitioner\'s loss was deductible in full from its ordinary income.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Board, 110 F.2d 614, holding that the loss sustained by petitioner was a loss from a sale of capital assets, \xc2\xa7 23(j), which, under \xc2\xa7 117(d), could be deducted from the gross income only to the extent of capital gains plus $2,000.  We granted certiorari, 310 U.S. 622, so that the case might be considered with the conflicting decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the <em>Hammel</em> case, 108 F.2d 753.  For the reasons stated in our opinion in the <em>Hammel</em> case, we think that this case was rightly decided below.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
