Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s traditional restraint in assessing federal criminal statutes\xe2\x80\x99 reach, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/593/index.html">515 U. S. 593</a>, 600, is particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the conviction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpersua[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is by itself innocuous.  Even \xe2\x80\x9cpersuad[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a person \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 cause\xe2\x80\x9d that person to \xe2\x80\x9cwithhold\xe2\x80\x9d testimony or documents from the Government is not inherently malign.  Under ordinary circumstances, it is not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy, even though the policy, in part, is created to keep certain information from others, including the Government.  Thus, \xc2\xa71512(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly \xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly persuades\xe2\x80\x9d phrase is key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the situation presented here.  The Government suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d does not modify \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly persuades,\xe2\x80\x9d but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.  \xe2\x80\x9c[K]nowledge\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness, and \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil.  Joining these meanings together makes sense both linguistically and in the statutory scheme.  Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly \xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly persuad[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  And limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows \xc2\xa71512(b) to reach only those with the level of culpability usually required to impose criminal liability.  See <em>Aguilar,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 602.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The jury instructions failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing.  Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.  For example, the jury was told that, even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could convict.  The instructions also diluted the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d such that it covered innocent conduct.  The District Court based its instruction on the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for \xc2\xa71503, which defined \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity\xe2\x80\x9d of a proceeding.  However, the court agreed with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on excluding \xe2\x80\x9cdishonestly\xe2\x80\x9d and adding the term \xe2\x80\x9cimpede\xe2\x80\x9d to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubvert or undermine,\xe2\x80\x9d so the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner intended to \xe2\x80\x9csubvert, undermine, or<em> </em>impede\xe2\x80\x9d governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.  These changes were significant.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]ishonest[y]\xe2\x80\x9d was no longer necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply \xe2\x80\x9cimpede[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding ability.  \xe2\x80\x9cImpede\xe2\x80\x9d has broader connotations than \xe2\x80\x9csubvert\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9cundermine,\xe2\x80\x9d and many of these connotations do not incorporate any \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  Under the dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cimpede,\xe2\x80\x9d anyone who innocently persuades another to withhold information from the Government \xe2\x80\x9cget[s] in the way of the progress of\xe2\x80\x9d the Government.  With regard to such innocent conduct, the \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d instructions did no limiting work whatsoever.  The instructions also led the jury to believe that it did not have to find <em>any </em>nexus between the \xe2\x80\x9cpersua[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d to destroy documents and any particular proceeding.  In resisting any nexus element, the Government relies on \xc2\xa71512(e)(1), which states that an official proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is, however, quite another thing to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen.  A \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly \xe2\x80\xa6 corrup[t] persaude[r]\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be someone who persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material.

A jury found that this action made petitioner guilty of violating 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71512(b)(2)(A) and (B).  These sections make it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly us[e] intimidation or physical force, threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e] another person \xe2\x80\xa6 with intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 cause\xe2\x80\x9d that person to \xe2\x80\x9cwithhold\xe2\x80\x9d documents from, or \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d documents for use in, an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  We hold that the jury instructions failed to convey properly the elements of a \xe2\x80\x9ccorrup[t] persuas[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d conviction under \xc2\xa71512(b), and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Enron Corporation, during the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, switched its business from operation of natural gas pipelines to an energy conglomerate, a move that was accompanied by aggressive accounting practices and rapid growth.  Petitioner audited Enron\xe2\x80\x99s publicly filed financial statements and provided internal audit and consulting services to it.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cengagement team\xe2\x80\x9d for Enron was headed by David Duncan.  Beginning in 2000, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s financial performance began to suffer, and, as 2001 wore on, worsened.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On August 14, 2001, Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), unexpectedly resigned.  Within days, Sherron Watkins, a senior accountant at Enron, warned Kenneth Lay, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s newly reappointed CEO, that Enron could \xe2\x80\x9cimplode in a wave of accounting scandals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 2.  She likewise informed Duncan and Michael Odom, one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s partners who had supervisory responsibility over Duncan, of the looming problems.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 28, an article in the Wall Street Journal suggested improprieties at Enron, and the SEC opened an informal investigation.  By early September, petitioner had formed an Enron \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis-response\xe2\x80\x9d team, which included Nancy Temple, an in-house counsel.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  On October 8, petitioner retained outside counsel to represent it in any litigation that might arise from the Enron matter.  The next day, Temple discussed Enron with other in-house counsel.  Her notes from that meeting reflect that \xe2\x80\x9csome SEC investigation\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9chighly probable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 10, Odom spoke at a general training meeting attended by 89 employees, including 10 from the Enron engagement team.  Odom urged everyone to comply with the firm\xe2\x80\x99s document retention policy.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  He added:  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f it\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed in the course of [the] normal policy and litigation is filed the next day, that\xe2\x80\x99s great\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

That release disclosed a $1.01 billion charge to earnings.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The following day, the SEC notified Enron by letter that it had opened an investigation in August and requested certain information and documents.  On October 19, Enron forwarded a copy of that letter to petitioner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the same day, Temple also sent an e-mail to a member of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s internal team of accounting experts and attached a copy of the document policy.  On October 20, the Enron crisis-response team held a conference call, during which Temple instructed everyone to \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ake sure to follow the [document] policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 7 (brackets in original).  On October 23, Enron CEO Lay declined to answer questions during a call with analysts because of \xe2\x80\x9cpotential lawsuits, as well as the SEC inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>After the call, Duncan met with other Andersen partners on the Enron engagement team and told them that they should ensure team members were complying with the document policy.  Another meeting for all team members followed, during which Duncan distributed the policy and told everyone to comply.  These, and other smaller meetings, were followed by substantial destruction of paper and electronic documents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On October 26, one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s senior partners circulated a New York Times article discussing the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s response to Enron.  His e-mail commented that \xe2\x80\x9cthe problems are just beginning and we will be in the cross hairs.  The marketplace is going to keep the pressure on this and is going to force the SEC to be tough.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 8.  On October 30, the SEC opened a formal investigation and sent Enron a letter that requested accounting documents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Throughout this time period, the document destruction continued, despite reservations by some of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s managers.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  On November 8, Enron announced that it would issue a comprehensive restatement of its earnings and assets.  Also on November 8, the SEC served Enron and petitioner with subpoenas for records.  On November 9, Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s secretary sent an e-mail that stated:  \xe2\x80\x9cPer Dave\xe2\x80\x94No more shredding\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. We have been officially served for our documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 10.  Enron filed for bankruptcy less than a month later.  Duncan was fired and later pleaded guilty to witness tampering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2002, petitioner was indicted in the Southern District of Texas on one count of violating \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71512(b)(2)(A) and (B).  The indictment alleged that, between October 10 and November 9, 2001, petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cdid knowingly, intentionally and corruptly persuade . . . other persons, to wit: [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] employees, with intent to cause\xe2\x80\x9d them to withhold documents from, and alter documents for use in, \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceedings, namely: regulatory and criminal proceedings and investigations.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. JA\xe2\x80\x93139.  A jury trial followed.  When the case went to the jury, that body deliberated for seven days and then declared that it was deadlocked.  The District Court delivered an \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Allen</em> charge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Allen</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/492/index.html">164 U.

The District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  374 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 284.  It held that the jury instructions properly conveyed the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly persuades\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d; that the jury need not find any consciousness of wrongdoing; and that there was no reversible error.  Because of a split of authority regarding the meaning of \xc2\xa71512(b), we granted certiorari.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  543 U.

S. 207</a> (1985), and out of concern that \xe2\x80\x98a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>McBoyle</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/25/index.html">283 U.

S. 593</a>, 600 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such restraint is particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the conviction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpersua[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is by itself innocuous.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cpersuad[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a person \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to \xe2\x80\xa6 cause\xe2\x80\x9d that person to \xe2\x80\x9cwithhold\xe2\x80\x9d testimony or documents from a Government proceeding or Government official is not inherently malign.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Consider, for instance, a mother who suggests to her son that he invoke his right against compelled self-incrimination, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, or a wife who persuades her husband not to disclose marital confidences, see <em>Trammel</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/40/index.html">445 U.

In <em>Upjohn Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/383/index.html">449 U. S. 383</a> (1981), for example, we held that Upjohn was justified in withholding documents that were covered by the attorney-client privilege from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  See <em>id.</em>, at 395.  No one would suggest that an attorney who \xe2\x80\x9cpersuade[d]\xe2\x80\x9d Upjohn to take that step acted wrongfully, even though he surely intended that his client keep those documents out of the IRS\xe2\x80\x99 hands.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDocument retention policies,\xe2\x80\x9d which are created in part to keep certain information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government, are common in business.  See generally Chase, To Shred or Not to Shred: Document Retention Policies and Federal Obstruction of Justice Statutes, 8 Ford. J. Corp. &amp; Fin. L. 721 (2003).  It is, of course, not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy under ordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acknowledging this point, the parties have largely focused their attention on the word \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d as the key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the situation presented here.  Section 1512(b) punishes not just \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly persuad[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another, but \xe2\x80\x9c<em>knowingly</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly persuad[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another.  (Emphasis added.)  The Government suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d does not modify \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly persuades,\xe2\x80\x9d but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.  It provides the <em>mens rea</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then a list of acts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cuses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or corruptly persuades.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have recognized with regard to similar statutory language that the <em>mens rea</em> at least applies to the acts that immediately follow, if not to <em>other</em> elements down the statutory chain.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72252(a)(1) and (2) \xe2\x80\x9csuggests that the term \xe2\x80\x98knowingly\xe2\x80\x99 modifies only the surrounding verbs: transports, ships, receives, distributes, or reproduces\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Liparota</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/419/index.html">471 U. S. 419</a> (1985).  The Government suggests that it is \xe2\x80\x9cquestionable whether Congress would employ such an inelegant formulation as \xe2\x80\x98knowingly\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly persuades.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 35, n.\xc2\xa018.  Long experience has not taught us to share the Government\xe2\x80\x99s doubts on this score, and we must simply interpret the statute as written.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties have not pointed us to another interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly \xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly\xe2\x80\x9d to guide us here.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In any event, the natural meaning of these terms provides a clear answer.  See <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a>, 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (1995).  \xe2\x80\x9c[K]nowledge\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1252\xe2\x80\x931253 (1993) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1981) (hereinafter Am. Hert.).  \xe2\x80\x9cCorrupt\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d are normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s 371; Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299\xe2\x80\x93300.  Joining these meanings together here makes sense both linguistically and in the statutory scheme.  Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 corruptly persuad[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  And limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows \xc2\xa71512(b) to reach only those with the level of \xe2\x80\x9cculpability \xe2\x80\xa6 we usually require in order to impose criminal liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar,</em> 515 U. S., at 602; see also <em>Liparota</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 426.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The outer limits of this element need not be explored here because the jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing.  Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.  For example, the jury was told that, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if [petitioner] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful, you may find [petitioner] guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. JA\xe2\x80\x93213.  The instructions also diluted the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d so that it covered innocent conduct.  <em>Id., </em>at JA\xe2\x80\x93212.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties vigorously disputed how the jury would be instructed on \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court based its instruction on the definition of that term found in the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for \xc2\xa71503.  This pattern instruction defined \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a proceeding.  Brief for Petitioner 3, n.\xc2\xa03 (emphasis deleted).  The Government, however, insisted on excluding \xe2\x80\x9cdishonestly\xe2\x80\x9d and adding the term \xe2\x80\x9cimpede\xe2\x80\x9d to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubvert or undermine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court agreed over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s objections, and the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner intended to \xe2\x80\x9csubvert, undermine, or<em> </em>impede\xe2\x80\x9d governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.  App. JA\xe2\x80\x93212.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These changes were significant.  No longer was any type of \xe2\x80\x9cdishonest[y]\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply \xe2\x80\x9cimpede[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding ability.  As the Government conceded at oral argument, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impede\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d has broader connotations than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subvert\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undermine,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, and many of these connotations do not incorporate any \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  The dictionary defines \xe2\x80\x9cimpede\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto interfere with or get in the way of the progress of\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chold up\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdetract from.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d 1132.  By definition, anyone who innocently persuades another to withhold information from the Government \xe2\x80\x9cget[s] in the way of the progress of\xe2\x80\x9d the Government.  With regard to such innocent conduct, the \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d instructions did no limiting work whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instructions also were infirm for another reason.  They led the jury to believe that it did not have to find <em>any </em>nexus between the \xe2\x80\x9cpersua[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d to destroy documents and any particular proceeding.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In resisting any type of nexus element, the Government relies heavily on \xc2\xa71512(e)(1), which states that an official proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is, however, one thing to say that a proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d and quite another to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen.  A \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly \xe2\x80\xa6 corrup[t] persaude[r]\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be someone who persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We faced a similar situation in <em>Aguilar,</em> <em>supra.</em>  Respondent Aguilar lied to a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in the course of an investigation and was convicted of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, and impede [a] \xe2\x80\xa6 grand jury investigation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71503.  515 U. S., at 599.  All the Government had shown was that Aguilar had uttered false statements to an investigating agent \xe2\x80\x9cwho might or might not testify before a grand jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 600.  We held that \xc2\xa71503 required something more\xe2\x80\x94specifically, a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the obstructive act and the proceeding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 599\xe2\x80\x93600.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9che lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 599.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the jury instructions here were flawed in important respects.
