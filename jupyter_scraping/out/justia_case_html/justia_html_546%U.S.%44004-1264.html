Respondents sued in Florida state court, alleging that Buckeye charged usurious interest rates and that the Agreement violated various Florida laws, rendering it criminal on its face.  The trial court denied Buckeye\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel arbitration, holding that a court rather than an arbitrator should resolve a claim that a contract is illegal and void <em>ab initio</em>.  A state appellate court reversed, but was in turn reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which reasoned that enforcing an arbitration agreement in a contract challenged as unlawful would violate state public policy and contract law.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Regardless of whether it is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of a contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause within it, must go to the arbitrator, not the court.  <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em> v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html">388 U. S. 395</a>, and <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/1/index.html">465 U. S. 1</a>, answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions.  First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.  See <em>Prima Paint,</em> 388 U. S., at 400, 402\xe2\x80\x93404.  Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.  See <em>id.</em>, at 403\xe2\x80\x93404.  Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts.  See <em>Southland, supra, </em>at 12<em>.  </em>The crux of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is that the Agreement as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.  Because this challenges the Agreement, and not specifically its arbitration provisions, the latter are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract, and the challenge should be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in declining to apply <em>Prima Paint\xe2\x80\x99</em>s severability rule, and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that that rule does not apply in state court runs contrary to <em>Prima Paint</em> and <em>Southland.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p align="left">894 So.\xc2\xa02d 860, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Stevens, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

For each separate transaction they signed a \xe2\x80\x9cDeferred Deposit and Disclosure Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d (Agreement), which included the following arbitration provisions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c1.\xc2\xa0<em>Arbitration Disclosure</em>  By signing this Agreement, you agree that i[f] a dispute of any kind arises out of this Agreement or your application therefore or any instrument relating thereto, th[e]n either you or we or third-parties involved can choose to have that dispute resolved by binding arbitration as set forth in Paragraph 2 below\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n2.\xc2\xa0<em>Arbitration Provisions</em>  Any claim, dispute, or controversy \xe2\x80\xa6 arising from or relating to this Agreement \xe2\x80\xa6 or the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agreement (collectively \xe2\x80\x98Claim\xe2\x80\x99), shall be resolved, upon the election of you or us or said third-parties, by binding arbitration \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  This arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\xe2\x80\x98FAA\xe2\x80\x99), 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.

Buckeye moved to compel arbitration.  The trial court denied the motion, holding that a court rather than an arbitrator should resolve a claim that a contract is illegal and void <em>ab initio</em>.  The District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Fourth District reversed, holding that because respondents did not challenge the arbitration provision itself, but instead claimed that the entire contract was void, the agreement to arbitrate was enforceable, and the question of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s legality should go to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that to enforce an agreement to arbitrate in a contract challenged as unlawful \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98could breathe life into a contract that not only violates state law, but also is criminal in nature\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  894 So. 2d 860, 862 (2005) (quoting <em>Party Yards, Inc.</em> v. <em>Templeton</em>, 751 So.\xc2\xa02d 121, 123 (Fla. App. 2000)).  We granted certiorari.  545 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To overcome judicial resistance to arbitration, Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9316.  Section 2 embodies the national policy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA written provision in \xe2\x80\xa6 a contract \xe2\x80\xa6 to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract \xe2\x80\xa6 or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nChallenges to the validity of arbitration agreements \xe2\x80\x9cupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\xe2\x80\x9d can be divided into two types.  One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.  See, <em>e.g., Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/1/index.html">465 U. S. 1</a>, 4\xe2\x80\x935 (1984) (challenging the agreement to arbitrate as void under California law insofar as it purported to cover claims brought under the state Franchise Investment Law).  The other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (<em>e.g.</em>, the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s provisions renders the whole contract invalid.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim is of this second type.  The crux of the complaint is that the contract as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Prima Paint Corp.</em> v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/395/index.html">388 U. S. 395</a> (1967), we addressed the question of who\xe2\x80\x94court or arbitrator\xe2\x80\x94decides these two types of challenges.  The issue in the case was \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved by the federal court, or whether the matter is to be referred to the arbitrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 402.  Guided by \xc2\xa74 of the FAA,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] we held that \xe2\x80\x9cif the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself\xe2\x80\x94an issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitrate\xe2\x80\x94the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it.  But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 403\xe2\x80\x93404 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  We rejected the view that the question of \xe2\x80\x9cseverability\xe2\x80\x9d was one of state law, so that if state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 400, 402\xe2\x80\x93403.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsequently, in <em>Southland Corp.</em>, we held that the FAA \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[d] a body of federal substantive law,\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9capplicable in state and federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We rejected the view that state law could bar enforcement of \xc2\xa72, even in the context of state-law claims brought in state court.  See <em>id</em>., at 10\xe2\x80\x9314; see also <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 270\xe2\x80\x93273 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Prima Paint</em> and <em>Southland</em> answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions.  First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.  Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.  Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts.  The parties have not requested, and we do not undertake, reconsideration of those holdings.  Applying them to this case, we conclude that because respondents challenge the Agreement, but not specifically its arbitration provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract.  The challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In declining to apply <em>Prima Paint\xe2\x80\x99</em>s rule of severability, the Florida Supreme Court relied on the distinction between void and voidable contracts.  \xe2\x80\x9cFlorida public policy and contract law,\xe2\x80\x9d it concluded, permit \xe2\x80\x9cno severable, or salvageable, parts of a contract found illegal and void under Florida law.\xe2\x80\x9d  894 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 864.  <em>Prima Paint</em> makes this conclusion irrelevant.  That case rejected application of state severability rules to the arbitration agreement <em>without discussing </em>whether the challenge at issue would have rendered the contract void or voidable.  See 388 U. S., at 400\xe2\x80\x93404.  Indeed, the opinion expressly disclaimed any need to decide what state-law remedy was available, <em>id., </em>at 400, n.\xc2\xa03, (though Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s dissent <em>asserted</em> that state law rendered the contract void, <em>id., </em>at 407).  Likewise in <em>Southland</em>, which arose in state court, we did not ask whether the several challenges made there\xe2\x80\x94fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the California Franchise Investment Law\xe2\x80\x94would render the contract void or voidable.  We simply rejected the proposition that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement turned on the state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment concerning the forum for enforcement of the state-law cause of action.  See 465 U. S., at 10.  So also here, we cannot accept the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that enforceability of the arbitration agreement should turn on \xe2\x80\x9cFlorida public policy and contract law,\xe2\x80\x9d 894 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 864.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents assert that <em>Prima Paint</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule of severability does not apply in state court.  They argue that <em>Prima Paint</em> interpreted only \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4\xe2\x80\x94two of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s procedural provisions, which appear to apply by their terms only in federal court\xe2\x80\x94but not \xc2\xa72, the only provision that we have applied in state court.  This does not accurately describe <em>Prima Paint</em>.  Although \xc2\xa74, in particular, had much to do with <em>Prima Paint</em>\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the rule of severability, see 388 U. S., at 403\xe2\x80\x93404, this rule ultimately arises out of \xc2\xa72, the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive command that arbitration agreements be treated like all other contracts.  The rule of severability establishes how this equal-footing guarantee for \xe2\x80\x9ca written [arbitration] provision\xe2\x80\x9d is to be implemented.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of <em>Prima Paint</em> as establishing nothing more than a federal-court rule of procedure also runs contrary to <em>Southland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of that case.  One of the bases for <em>Southland\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>application of \xc2\xa72 in state court was precisely <em>Prima Paint</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creli[ance] for [its] holding on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 broad power to fashion substantive rules under the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 11; see also <em>Prima Paint</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 407 (Black, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Court here holds that the [FAA], as a matter of <em>federal substantive law</em> \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  <em>Southland</em> itself refused to \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve Congress intended to limit the Arbitration Act to disputes subject only to <em>federal</em>-court jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents point to the language of \xc2\xa72, which renders \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca written provision in\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9can agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since, respondents argue, the only arbitration agreements to which \xc2\xa72 applies are those involving a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract,\xe2\x80\x9d and since an agreement void <em>ab initio</em> under state law is not a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision\xe2\x80\x9d in or \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy arising out of\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract,\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xc2\xa72 can apply.  This argument echoes Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in <em>Prima Paint:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cSections 2 and 3 of the Act assume the existence of a valid contract.  They merely provide for enforcement where such a valid contract exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  388 U. S., at 412\xe2\x80\x93413.  We do not read \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d so narrowly.  The word appears four times in \xc2\xa72.  Its last appearance is in the final clause, which allows a challenge to an arbitration provision \xe2\x80\x9cupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any <em>contract</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  There can be no doubt that \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d as used this last time must include contracts that later prove to be void.  Otherwise, the grounds for revocation would be limited to those that rendered a contract voidable\xe2\x80\x94which would mean (implausibly) that an arbitration agreement could be challenged as voidable but not as void.   Because the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s final use of \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d so obviously includes putative contracts, we will not read the same word earlier in the same sentence to have a more narrow meaning.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We note that neither <em>Prima Paint</em> nor <em>Southland</em> lends support to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading; as we have discussed, neither case turned on whether the challenge at issue would render the contract voidable or void.</p>\n<p align="left"> *\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, as respondents assert, that the <em>Prima Paint</em> rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void.  But it is equally true that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable.  <em>Prima Paint</em> resolved this conundrum\xe2\x80\x94and resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.  We reaffirm today that, regardless of whether the challenge is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause, must go to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p align="left"><left>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. </left></p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The issue of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s validity is different from the issue of whether any agreement between the alleged obligor and obligee was ever concluded.
