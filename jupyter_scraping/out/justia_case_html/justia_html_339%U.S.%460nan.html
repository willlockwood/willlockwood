S. 469</span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Does the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution bar a State from use of the injunction to prohibit picketing of a place of business solely in order to secure compliance with a demand that its employees be in proportion to the racial origin of its then customers?  Such is the broad question of this case.</p>\n<p>The petitioners, acting on behalf of a group calling themselves Progressive Citizens of America, demanded of Lucky Stores, Inc., that it hire Negroes at its grocery store near the Canal Housing Project in Richmond, California, as white clerks quit or were transferred, until the proportion of Negro clerks to white clerks approximated the proportion of Negro to white customers.  At the time in controversy, about 50% of the customers of the Canal store were Negroes.  Upon refusal of this demand and in order to compel compliance, the Canal store was systematically patrolled by pickets carrying placards stating that Lucky refused to hire Negro clerks in proportion to Negro customers. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 339 U. S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Suit was begun by Lucky to enjoin the picketing on appropriate allegations for equitable relief.  The Superior Court of Contra Costa County issued a preliminary injunction restraining petitioners and others from picketing any of Lucky\'s stores to compel "the selective hiring of negro clerks, such hiring to be based on the proportion of white and negro customers who patronize plaintiff\'s stores."  In the face of this injunction, petitioners continued to picket the Canal store, carrying placards reading:  "Lucky Won\'t Hire Negro Clerks in Proportion to Negro Trade -- Don\'t Patronize."  In conformity with State procedure, petitioners were found guilty of contempt for "willfully disregarding" the injunction, and were sentenced to imprisonment for two days and fined $20 each.  They defended their conduct by challenging the injunction as a deprivation of the liberty assured them by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The intermediate appellate court annulled the judgment of contempt, 186 P.2d 756, but it was reinstated on review by the Supreme Court of California.  That court held that the conceded purpose of the picketing in this case -- to compel the hiring of Negroes in proportion to Negro customers -- was unlawful even though pursued in a peaceful manner.  Having violated a valid injunction, petitioners were properly punishable for contempt.  "The controlling points," according to the decision of the Supreme Court of California,</p>\n<p>"are that the injunction is limited to prohibiting picketing for a specific unlawful purpose, and that the evidence justified the trial court in finding that such narrow prohibition was deliberately violated."</p>\n<p>32 Cal.2d 850, 856, 198 P.2d 885, 888.  We brought the case here to consider claims of infringement of the right of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  336 U.S. 966. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 339 U. S. 463</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  Discrimination against Negroes in employment has brought a variety of legal issues before this Court in recent years.  <em>Graham v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/232/case.html">338 U. S. 232</a></span>; <em>Railway Mail Assn. v. Corsi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/88/case.html">326 U. S. 88</a></span>; <em>Steele v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/192/case.html">323 U. S. 192</a></span>; <em>Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/210/case.html">323 U. S. 210</a></span>; <em>New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/552/case.html">303 U. S. 552</a></span>.  <em>See also</em> Myrdal, An American Dilemma cc. 13-14 (1944).  Such discrimination raises sociological problems which, in some aspects and within limits, have received legal solutions.  California has been sensitive to these problems, and decisions of its Supreme Court have been hostile to discrimination on the basis of color.  <em>James v. Marinship Corp.,</em> 25 Cal.2d 721, 155 P.2d 329; <em>Williams v. International Brotherhood of Boilermakers,</em> 27 Cal.2d 586, 165 P.2d 903.  This background of California\'s legal policy is relevant to the conviction of its court that it would encourage discriminatory hiring to give constitutional protection to petitioners\' efforts to subject the opportunity of getting a job to a quota system.  The view of that court is best expressed in its own words:</p>\n<p>"It was just such a situation -- an arbitrary discrimination upon the basis of race and color alone, rather than a choice based solely upon individual qualification for the work to be done -- which we condemned in the <em>Marinship</em> case, <em>supra,</em> (25 Cal.2d 721, 737, 745).  The fact that those seeking such discrimination do not demand that it be practiced as to all employees of a particular employer diminishes in no respect the unlawfulness of their purpose; they would, to the extent of the fixed proportion, make the right to work for Lucky dependent not on fitness for the work nor on an equal right of all, regardless of race, to compete in an open market, but rather, on membership </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 339 U. S. 464</a></p><p> in a particular race.  If petitioners were upheld in their demand, then other races, white, yellow, brown, and red, would have equal rights to demand discriminatory hiring on a racial basis.  Yet that is precisely the type of discrimination to which petitioners avowedly object."</p>\n<p>32 Cal.2d at 856, 198 P.2d at 889.</p>\n<p>These considerations are most pertinent in regard to a population made up of so many diverse groups as ours.  To deny to California the right to ban picketing in the circumstances of this case would mean that there could be no prohibition of the pressure of picketing to secure proportional employment on ancestral grounds of Hungarians in Cleveland, of Poles in Buffalo, of Germans in Milwaukee, of Portuguese in New Bedford, of Mexicans in San Antonio, of the numerous minority groups in New York, and so on through the whole gamut of racial and religious concentrations in various cities.  States may well believe that such constitutional sheltering would inevitably encourage use of picketing to compel employment on the basis of racial discrimination.  In disallowing such picketing, States may act under the belief that otherwise community tensions and conflicts would be exacerbated.  The differences in cultural traditions, instead of adding flavor and variety to our common citizenry, might well be hardened into hostilities by leave of law.  The Constitution does not demand that the element of communication in picketing prevail over the mischief furthered by its use in these situations.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  "[T]he domain of liberty, withdrawn by the Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the states," <em>Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html#327">302 U. S. 327</a></span>, no doubt includes liberty of thought and appropriate means for expressing it.  But, while picketing is a mode of communication, it is inseparably something more and different.  Industrial picketing</p>\n<p>"is more than free speech, since it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 339 U. S. 465</a></p><p> involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated."</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by BLACK and Murphy, JJ., concurring in <em>Bakery &amp; Pastry Drivers &amp; Helpers Local v. Wohl,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/769/case.html">315 U. S. 769</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/769/case.html#775">315 U. S. 775</a></span>-776.  Publication in a newspaper, or by distribution of circulars, may convey the same information or make the same charge as do those patrolling a picket line.  But the very purpose of a picket line is to exert influences, and it produces consequences, different from other modes of communication.  The loyalties and responses evoked and exacted by picket lines are unlike those flowing from appeals by printed word.  <em>See</em> Gregory, Labor and the Law 346-48 (rev. ed.1949); Teller, Picketing and Free Speech, 56 Harv.L.Rev. 180, 200-02 (1942); Dodd, Picketing and Free Speech:  A Dissent, 56 Harv.L.Rev. 513, 517 (1943); Hellerstein, Picketing Legislation and the Courts, 10 N.C.L.Rev. 158, 186-87, n. 135 (1932).</p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  A State may constitutionally permit picketing despite the ingredients in it that differentiate it from speech in its ordinary context.  <em>Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/468/case.html">301 U. S. 468</a></span>.  And we have found that, because of its element of communication, picketing under some circumstances finds sanction in the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Thornhill v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/case.html">310 U. S. 88</a></span>; <em>American Federation of Labor v. Swing,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/321/case.html">312 U. S. 321</a></span>; <em>Bakery &amp; Pastry Drivers &amp; Helpers Local v.

Angelos,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/320/293/case.html">320 U. S. 293</a></span>.  However general or loose the language of opinions, the specific situations have controlled decision.  It has been amply recognized that picketing, not being the equivalent of speech as a matter of fact, is not its inevitable legal equivalent.  Picketing is not beyond the control of a State if the manner in which picketing is conducted or the purpose which it seeks </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 339 U. S. 466</a></p><p> to effectuate gives ground for its disallowance.  <em>See Dorchy v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/306/case.html">272 U. S. 306</a></span>; <em>Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/287/case.html">312 U.

S. 775</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The constitutional boundary line between the competing interests of society involved in the use of picketing cannot be established by general phrases.  Picketing, when not in numbers that of themselves carry a threat of violence, may be a lawful means to a lawful end.  <em>See American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/184/case.html">257 U.

The California Supreme Court suggested a distinction between picketing to promote discrimination, as here, and picketing against discrimination:</p>\n<p>"It may be assumed for the purposes of this decision, without deciding, that, if such discrimination exists, picketing to protest it would not be for an unlawful objective."</p>\n<p>32 Cal.2d at 855, 198 P.2d at 888.  We cannot construe the Due Process Clause as precluding California from securing respect for its policy against involuntary employment on racial lines by prohibiting systematic picketing that would subvert such policy.  <em>See Giboney v. Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fourth.</em>  The fact that California\'s policy is expressed by the judicial organ of the State, rather than by the legislature we have repeatedly ruled to be immaterial. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/460/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 339 U.

Contrariwise, a State may deem it wiser policy to regulate.  Regulation may take the form of legislation, <em>e.g.,</em> restraint of trade statutes, or be left to the <em>ad hoc</em> judicial process, <em>e.g.,</em> common law mode of dealing with restraints of trade.  Either method may outlaw an end not in the public interest or merely address itself to the obvious means toward such end.  The form the regulation should take and its scope are surely matters of policy and, as such, within a State\'s choice.</p>\n<p>If, because of the compulsive features inherent in picketing, beyond the aspect of mere communication as an appeal to reason, a State chooses to enjoin picketing to secure submission to a demand for employment proportional to the racial origin of the then customers of a business, it need not forbid the employer to adopt such a quota system of his own free will.  A State is not required to exercise its intervention on the basis of abstract reasoning.  The Constitution commands neither logical symmetry nor exhaustion of a principle.</p>\n<p>"The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations, -- illogical, it may be, and unscientific."</p>\n<p><em>Metropolis Theater Co. v.

JUSTICE REED, concurring.</p>\n<p>I read the opinion of the Supreme Court of California to hold that the pickets sought from Lucky Stores, Inc., discrimination in favor of persons of the Negro race, a discrimination unlawful under California law.
