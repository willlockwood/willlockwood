The State Supreme Court reversed and remanded for trial, holding that public policy required recognition of an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.

In order to prevail on the cause of action, as formulated by the Texas Supreme Court, a plaintiff must plead, and the trial court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and the employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the employment.  Because the existence of a plan is a critical factor in establishing liability, and the trial court\'s inquiry must be directed to the plan, this judicially created cause of action "relate[s] to" an ERISA plan.  <em>Cf. Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html">486 U. S. 825</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html#828">486 U. S. 828</a></span>, and <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.

In arguing that the plan is irrelevant to the cause of action because all that is at issue is the employer\'s improper motive, McClendon misses the point, which is that, under the state court\'s analysis, there simply is no cause of action if there is no plan.  Similarly unavailing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 498 U. S. 134</a></p><p> is McClendon\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 514(c)(2) -- which defines "State" to include any state instrumentality purporting to regulate the terms and conditions of covered plans -- causes \xc2\xa7 514(a) to preempt only those state laws that affect plan terms, conditions, or administration, and not those that focus on the employer\'s termination decision.  That argument misreads \xc2\xa7 514(c)(2), and consequently misapprehends its purpose of expanding ERISA\'s general definition of "State" to "include" state instrumentalities whose actions might not otherwise be considered state law for preemption purposes; would render \xc2\xa7 514(a)\'s "relate to" language superfluous, since Congress need only have said that "all" state laws would be preempted; and is foreclosed by this Court\'s precedents, <em>see Mackey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html#828">486 U.

Preemption here is also supported by \xc2\xa7 514(a)\'s goal of ensuring uniformity in pension law, since allowing state based actions like the one at issue might subject plans and plan sponsors to conflicting substantive requirements developed by the courts of each jurisdiction.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/133/case.html#138">498 U. S. 138</a></span>-142.</p>\n<p>(b) The Texas cause of action is also preempted because it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  McClendon\'s claim falls squarely within ERISA \xc2\xa7 510 which prohibits the discharge of a plan participant "for the purpose of interfering with [his] attainment of any right . . . under the plan."  However, that in itself does not imply preemption of state remedies absent "special features" warranting preemption.  <em>See, e.g., English v. General Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/72/case.html">496 U. S. 72</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/72/case.html#87">496 U. S. 87</a></span>.  Such a "special featur[e]" exists in the form of \xc2\xa7 502(a), which authorizes a civil action by a plan participant to enforce ERISA\'s or the plan\'s terms, gives the federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of such actions, and has been held to be the exclusive remedy for rights guaranteed by ERISA, including those provided by \xc2\xa7 510, <em>Pilot Life Ins.

Thus, the lower court\'s attempt to distinguish this case as not one within ERISA\'s purview is without merit.  Moreover, since there is no basis in \xc2\xa7 502(a)\'s language for limiting ERISA actions to only those which seek "pension benefits," it is clear that the relief requested here is well within the power of federal courts; the fact that a particular plaintiff is not seeking recovery of pension benefits is no answer to a preemption argument.

In 1981, after McClendon had worked for the company for nine years and eight months, the company fired him, citing a company-wide reduction in force.  McClendon sued the company in Texas state court, alleging that his pension would have vested in another four months and that a principal reason for his termination was the company\'s desire </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 498 U. S. 136</a></p><p> to avoid making contributions to his pension fund.  McClendon did not realize that, pursuant to applicable regulations, <em>see</em> 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 2530.200b-4 (1990) (break-in-service regulation), he had already been credited with sufficient service to vest his pension under the plan\'s 10-year requirement.  McClendon sought compensatory and punitive damages under various tort and contract theories; he did not assert any cause of action under ERISA.  After a period of discovery, the company moved for, and obtained, summary judgment on all claims.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that McClendon\'s employment was terminable at will.  757 S.W.2d 816 (1988).</p>\n<p>In a 5-to-4 decision, the Texas Supreme Court reversed and remanded for trial.  The majority reasoned that, notwithstanding the traditional employment-at-will doctrine, public policy imposes certain limitations upon an employer\'s power to discharge at-will employees.  Citing Tex.Rev. Civ.Stat.Ann., Title 110B (Vernon 1988 pamphlet), and \xc2\xa7 510 of ERISA, the majority concluded that "the state has an interest in protecting employees\' interests in pension plans."  779 S.W.2d 69, 71 (1989).  As support, the court noted that "[t]he very passage of ERISA demonstrates the great significance attached to income security for retirement purposes."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the court held that, under Texas law, a plaintiff could recover in a wrongful discharge action if he established that</p>\n<p>"the principal reason for his termination was the employer\'s desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee\'s pension fund."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The court noted that federal courts had held similar claims preempted by ERISA, but distinguished the present case on the basis that McClendon was</p>\n<p>"<em>not</em> seeking lost <em>pension benefits,</em> but [was] instead seeking future lost wages, mental anguish and punitive damages as a result of the wrongful discharge."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 71, n. 3 (emphasis in original). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 498 U.

Regardless of the avenue we follow -- whether explicit or implied preemption -- this state law cause of action cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Where, as here, Congress has expressly included a broadly worded preemption provision in a comprehensive statute such as ERISA, our task of discerning congressional intent is considerably simplified.

The key to \xc2\xa7 514(a) is found in the words "relate to."  Congress used those words in their broad sense, rejecting more limited preemption language that would have made the clause "applicable only to state laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA."  <em>Shaw, supra,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#98">463 U.

Moreover, to underscore its intent that \xc2\xa7 514(a) be expansively applied, Congress used equally broad language in defining </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 498 U.

Such laws include "all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law."  \xc2\xa7 514(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(c)(1).\n</em></p>\n<p>"A law 1relates to\' an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan."  <em>Shaw, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#96">463 U.

Under this "broad common sense meaning," a state law may "relate to" a benefit plan, and thereby be preempted, even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect.  <em>Pilot Life, supra,</em> 481 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/case.html#47">481 U.

Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/case.html">471 U.

S. 739</a></span> (1985).</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding its breadth, we have recognized limits to ERISA\'s preemption clause.  In <em>Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html">486 U. S. 825</a></span> (1988), the Court held that ERISA did not preempt a State\'s general garnishment statute, even though it was applied to collect judgments against plan participants.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html#841">486 U. S. 841</a></span>.  The fact that collection might burden the administration of a plan did not, by itself, compel preemption. Moreover, under the plain language of \xc2\xa7 514(a), the Court has held that only state laws that relate to benefit plans are preempted.  <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html">482 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html#23">482 U. S. 23</a></span> (1987).  Thus, even though a state law required payment of severance benefits, which would normally fall within the purview of ERISA, it was not preempted, because the statute did not require the establishment or maintenance of an ongoing plan.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html#12">482 U. S. 12</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Neither of these limitations is applicable to this case.  We are not dealing here with a generally applicable statute that makes no reference to, or indeed functions irrespective of, the existence of an ERISA plan.  Nor is the cost of defending this lawsuit a mere administrative burden.  Here, the existence of a pension plan is a critical factor in establishing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 498 U. S. 140</a></p><p> liability under the State\'s wrongful discharge law.  As a result, this cause of action relates not merely to pension benefits, but to the essence of the pension <em>plan</em> itself.</p>\n<p>We have no difficulty in concluding that the cause of action which the Texas Supreme Court recognized here -- a claim that the employer wrongfully terminated plaintiff primarily because of the employer\'s desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee\'s pension fund -- "relate[s] to" an ERISA-covered plan within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 514(a), and is therefore preempted.</p>\n<p>"[W]e have virtually taken it for granted that state laws which are \'specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans\' are preempted under \xc2\xa7 514(a)."</p>\n<p><em>Mackey, supra,</em> 486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html#829">486 U. S. 829</a></span>.  In <em>Mackey,</em> the statute\'s express reference to ERISA plans established that it was so designed; consequently, it was preempted.  The facts here are slightly different, but the principle is the same:  The Texas cause of action makes specific reference to, and indeed is premised on, the existence of a pension plan.  In the words of the Texas court, the cause of action</p>\n<p>"allows recovery when the plaintiff proves that the principal reason for his termination was the employer\'s desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee\'s pension fund."</p>\n<p>779 S.W.2d at 71.  Thus, in order to prevail, a plaintiff must plead, and the court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and the employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the employment.  Because the court\'s inquiry must be directed to the plan, this judicially created cause of action "relate[s] to" an ERISA plan.</p>\n<p>McClendon argues that the pension plan is irrelevant to the Texas cause of action, because all that is at issue is the employer\'s improper motive to avoid its pension obligations.  The argument misses the point, which is that, under the Texas court\'s analysis, there simply is <em>no</em> cause of action if there is no plan. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 498 U. S. 141</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Similarly unavailing is McClendon\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 514(a) is limited by the narrower language of \xc2\xa7 514(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<p>"The term \'State\' includes a State, any political subdivisions thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either, which purports to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this subchapter."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(c)(2).</p>\n<p>McClendon argues that \xc2\xa7 514(c)(2)\'s limiting language causes \xc2\xa7 514(a) to preempt only those state laws that affect plan terms, conditions, or administration.  Since the cause of action recognized by the Texas court does not focus on those items, but rather on the employer\'s termination decision, McClendon claims that there can be no preemption here.</p>\n<p>The flaw in this argument is that it misreads \xc2\xa7 514(c)(2), and consequently misapprehends its purpose.  The ERISA definition of "State" is found in \xc2\xa7 3(10), which defines the term as</p>\n<p>"any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island, and the Canal Zone."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1002(10).  Section 514(c)(2) expands, rather than restricts, that definition for preemption purposes in order to "include" state agencies and instrumentalities whose actions might not otherwise be considered state law.  Had Congress intended to restrict ERISA\'s preemptive effect to state laws purporting to regulate plan terms and conditions, it surely would not have done so by placing the restriction in an adjunct definition section, while using the broad phrase "relate to" in the preemption section itself.  Moreover, if \xc2\xa7 514(a) were construed as McClendon urges, the "relate to" language would be superfluous -- Congress need only have said that "all" state laws would be preempted.  Moreover, our precedents foreclose this argument.  In <em>Mackey,</em> the Court held that ERISA preempted a Georgia garnishment statute that <em>excluded</em> from garnishment ERISA plan benefits.  <em>Mackey, supra,</em> 486 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/case.html#828">486 U. S. 828</a></span>, and n. 2.  Such a law clearly did not regulate the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 498 U. S. 142</a></p><p> terms or conditions of ERISA-covered plans, and yet we found preemption.  <em>Mackey</em> demonstrates that \xc2\xa7 514(a) cannot be read so restrictively.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that the cause of action in this case is preempted by \xc2\xa7 514(a) is supported by our understanding of the purposes of that provision.  Section 514(a) was intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefit law; the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government.  Otherwise, the inefficiencies created could work to the detriment of plan beneficiaries.  <em>FMC Corp.,ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/52/case.html#60">498 U. S. 60</a></span> (citing <em>Fort Halifax,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html#10">482 U. S. 10</a></span>-11); <em>Shaw,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#105">463 U. S. 105</a></span>, and n. 25.  Allowing state based actions like the one at issue here would subject plans and plan sponsors to burdens not unlike those that Congress sought to foreclose through \xc2\xa7 514(a).  Particularly disruptive is the potential for conflict in substantive law.  It is foreseeable that state courts, exercising their common law powers, might develop different substantive standards applicable to the same employer conduct, requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.  Such an outcome is fundamentally at odds with the goal of uniformity that Congress sought to implement.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Even if there were no express preemption in this case, the Texas cause of action would be preempted because it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  McClendon\'s claim falls squarely within the ambit of ERISA \xc2\xa7 510, which provides:</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan . . . <em>or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 498 U. S. 143</a></p><p> <em>of any right to which such participant may become entitled</em> under the plan. . . ."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1140 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>By its terms, \xc2\xa7 510 protects plan participants from termination motivated by an employer\'s desire to prevent a pension from vesting.  Congress viewed this section as a crucial part of ERISA because, without it, employers would be able to circumvent the provision of promised benefits.  S.Rep. No. 93-127, pp. 35-36 (1973); H.R.Rep. No. 93-533, p. 17 (1973).  We have no doubt that this claim is prototypical of the kind Congress intended to cover under \xc2\xa7 510.</p>\n<p>"[T]he mere existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme," however, even a considerably detailed one, "does not by itself imply preemption of state remedies."  <em>English v.

Unquestionably, the Texas cause of action purports to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed by \xc2\xa7 510 and exclusively enforced by \xc2\xa7 502(a).  Accordingly we hold that</p>\n<p>"\'[w]hen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected\' by \xc2\xa7 510 of ERISA, \'due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Cf.

Not only is \xc2\xa7 502(a) the exclusive remedy for vindicating \xc2\xa7 510-protected rights, there is no basis in \xc2\xa7 502(a)\'s language for limiting ERISA actions to only those which seek "pension benefits."  It is clear that the relief requested here is well within the power of federal courts to provide.
