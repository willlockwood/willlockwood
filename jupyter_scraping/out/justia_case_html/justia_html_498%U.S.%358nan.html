Dept. of Treasury, 498 U.S.  358 (1991)</h3><p><b>Trinova Corporation v. Michigan Department of Treasury</b></p><p><b>No. 89-1106</b></p><p><b>Argued Oct. 1, 1990</b></p><p><b>Decided Feb. 19, 1991</b></p><p><b>498 U.S. 358</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Michigan\'s single business tax (SBT) is a value added tax (VAT) levied against entities having "business activity" within the State.  As part of the SBT computation, a taxpayer doing business both within and without the State must determine its apportioned tax base by multiplying its total value added -- which consists of its profit, as represented by its federal taxable income, plus compensation paid to labor, depreciation on capital, and other factors -- by the portion of its business activity attributable to Michigan -- which consists of the average of three ratios:  (1) Michigan payroll to total payroll, (2) Michigan property to total property, and (3) Michigan sales to total sales.  During 1980, the tax year in question, petitioner Trinova, an Ohio corporation, maintained a 14-person sales office in Michigan.  Under the SBT formula, its 1980 payroll and property apportionment factors were only .2328% and .0930% respectively, while its sales factor was 26.5892%, representing Michigan sales of over $100 million.  Although its 1980 federal taxable income showed a loss of almost $42.5 million, Trinova\'s SBT computation resulted in a tax of over $293,000.  Trinova paid the tax, but subsequently filed an amended return and refund claim, alleging that it was entitled to relief under Michigan law because the SBT\'s apportionment provisions did not fairly represent the extent of its business activity within the State.  The amended return proposed that Trinova\'s company-wide compensation and depreciation be excluded from its pre-apportionment value added, and that its actual Michigan compensation and depreciation be added back into its apportioned tax base, which would result in a negative value added apportioned to Michigan and entitle the company to a refund for its entire 1980 SBT payment.  When respondent Department of Treasury denied relief, Trinova sued for a refund in the State Court of Claims, which ruled in its favor.  However, the State Court of Appeals held that Trinova was not entitled to statutory relief, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the SBT\'s three- factor apportionment formula did not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 498 U. S. 359</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  As applied to Trinova during the tax year at issue, the SBT\'s three-factor apportionment formula does not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/358/case.html#372">498 U. S. 372</a></span>-387.</p>\n<p>(a) Under the test stated in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v.

S. 279</a></span>, a state tax levied upon multistate businesses is valid under the Commerce Clause if, as relevant here, it is fairly apportioned and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Moreover, the <em>Complete Auto</em> test encompasses the Due Process Clause requirement that, <em>inter alia,</em> a rational relationship exist between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.  <em>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/425/case.html">445 U.

S. 372</a></span>-373.</p>\n<p>(b) Because the SBT attempts to tax a base that cannot be assigned to one geographic location with any precision, the decision to apportion the tax is not unconstitutional.  Although Trinova\'s compensation and depreciation may appear in isolation to be susceptible of geographic designation, those elements cannot be separated from income, which cannot be located in a single State.  The SBT is not a combination or series of several smaller taxes on compensation, depreciation, and income, but is an indivisible tax upon a different, bona fide measure of business activity, the value added.  This conclusion is no different than the one this Court has reached in upholding the validity of state apportionment of income taxes.  The same factors that prevent determination of the geographic location where income is generated -- such as functional integration of the intrastate and extrastate activities of a unitary business enterprise, centralization of management, and economies of scale -- make it impossible to determine the location of value added with exact precision.  <em>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/425/case.html#438">445 U. S. 438</a></span>; <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, New Jersey Dept. of Treasury,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/66/case.html">490 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/66/case.html#74">490 U. S. 74</a></span>.  Thus, although Trinova had no federal income during 1980, it cannot be relieved of tax upon its Michigan business.  Such relief would be incompatible with the rationale of a VAT, under which tax becomes due even if the taxpayer was unprofitable, and is unsupported by the record.  Trinova\'s approach would require the conclusion that it added value only at the factory through the consumption of capital and labor, while the record would as easily support a finding that its production operations added little value, and its sales offices added significant value.  Although Trinova\'s 14 Michigan sales personnel need not be relied on as the sole, or even a substantial, source of all the value added that can be apportioned fairly to Michigan, it cannot be doubted that, without the company\'s $100 million in Michigan sales, its total value added would have been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 498 U. S. 360</a></p><p> lower to a remarkable degree.  It distorts the SBT both in application and theory to confine value added consequences of the Michigan market solely to the labor and capital expended by the resident sales force.

S. 373</a></span>-379.</p>\n<p>(c) The SBT\'s three-factor apportionment formula cannot be ruled unfair, since Trinova has failed to meet its burden of proving, by clear and cogent evidence, that there is no rational relationship between its tax base measure attributed to Michigan and the contribution of its Michigan business activity to the entire value added process.  <em>Cf., e.g., Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html">463 U. S. 159</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html#169">463 U. S. 169</a></span>, 180-181; Moorman Mfg. Co. v.

S. 274</a></span>.  This Court has approved the same formula for apportionment of income, <em>see, e.g., Butler Bros v. McColgan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/501/case.html">315 U. S. 501</a></span>, and the formula has gained wide acceptance in that context "because payroll, property, and sales appear in combination to reflect a very large share of the activities <em>by which value is generated,</em>" <em>Container Corp., supra,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html#183">463 U. S. 183</a></span> (emphasis added).  Trinova\'s argument -- that the formula leads to a distorted result, out of all proportion to the company\'s Michigan business, because sales have no relationship to, and add nothing to, the value that compensation and depreciable plant contribute to the Michigan tax base -- is rejected, since sales (as a measure of market demand) do have a profound impact upon the amount of an enterprise\'s value added, and since there is no basis for distinguishing similar arguments that were pressed, and rejected by this Court, with regard to the apportionment of income.  Because the three-factor formula causes no distortion, the SBT does not tax value earned outside Michigan.  The argument that the value was added in Ohio, by labor and capital, and that no value has been added in Michigan, wrongly assumes that value added is subject to geographic ascertainment and that a sales factor is inappropriate in apportionment.  Trinova gives no estimate of the value added that would take account of both its Michigan sales activity and Michigan market demand for its products, whereas the State has consistently applied the three-factor formula and has enacted further provisions giving relief to labor-intensive taxpayers like Trinova.

Trinova cannot point to any treatment of in-state and out-of-state firms that is discriminatory on its face.  Although <em>American Trucking Assns. v.

Nor is that accusation supported by a statement of Michigan\'s Governor that the SBT was enacted to promote business </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 498 U.

Michigan is the first and, the parties tell us, the only State to have enacted a VAT as a tax on business activity.  We begin with a description of value added and VAT\'s in general, and then discuss the Michigan SBT.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Value added is an economic concept.</p>\n<p>"Value added is defined as the increase in the value of goods and services brought about by whatever a business does to them between the time of purchase and the time of sale."</p>\n<p>Haughey, The Economic Logic of the Single Business Tax, 22 Wayne L.Rev. 1017, 1018 (1976) (hereinafter Haughey).  The value a business adds to a single product is</p>\n<p>"the difference between the value of the product at sale and the cost of goods purchased from other businesses that went into the product."</p>\n<p>Taxation and Economic Policy Office, Michigan Department of Treasury, Analysis of the Michigan Single Business Tax 20-21 (1985) (hereinafter SBT Analysis).  It follows that the sale price of a product is the total of all value added by each step of the production process to that point.</p>\n<p>"The value added of a loaf of bread is the sum of the value contributed at each stage of the production and distribution process.  Among others, it includes the contribution of the farmer, miller, baker, wholesaler and retailer."</p>\n<p>Haughey 1019.</p>\n<p>A business "adds value by handling or processing these [goods] with its labor force, machinery, buildings and capital."  R. Kleine, Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, The Michigan Single Business Tax:  A Different Approach to State Business Taxation 1 (1978) (hereinafter Kleine).  In this litigation, value added usually refers to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 498 U. S. 363</a></p><p> activities of a single business enterprise.  The term can, however, be used with regard to a single product, or even an entire economy.</p>\n<p>"[Value added] is a means of consistently measuring the size of business firms and other economic enterprises comprising the total economy. . . .  Gross National Product is virtually equivalent to national value added."</p>\n<p>Haughey 1017.</p>\n<p>One of the acknowledged advantages of value added as a measure of taxation is its neutrality.  A VAT is neutral in the sense that it taxes all business activity alike:  under a pure VAT, all forms of business organization (corporation, partnership, proprietorship), all types of financing (debt, equity), and all methods of production (capital intensive, labor intensive) bear the same tax burden.</p>\n<p>"[T]ax factors are minimized in business decisions; inherent advantages and relative efficiencies are allowed to operate in the market economy with minimum tax distortions."</p>\n<p>"This neutrality of a value-added tax is in notable contrast to the effects of both the corporation income tax and the payroll taxes.  The former, by definition, is applied only to corporations, and varies with their reliance on equity rather than debt capital and the efficiency with which they use equity capital -- that is, their net profits."</p>\n<p>Smith, Value-added tax:  the case for, 48 Harv.Bus.Rev. 77, 79 (1970).  Though neutral in theory, VAT\'s often depart in practice from the pure value-added model because of special exemptions, deductions, and other adjustments.  These features can eliminate much of the claim to neutrality.  <em>See generally,</em> The Value-Added Tax:  Lessons from Europe (H. Aaron ed.1981).</p>\n<p>A VAT differs in important respects from a corporate income tax.  A corporate income tax is based on the philosophy of ability to pay, as it consists of some portion of the profit remaining after a company has provided for its workers, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 498 U. S. 364</a></p><p> suppliers, and other creditors.  A VAT, on the other hand, is a much broader measure of a firm\'s total business activity.  Even if a business entity is unprofitable, under normal circumstances it adds value to its products and, as a consequence, will owe some VAT.  Because value added is a measure of actual business activity, a VAT correlates more closely to the volume of governmental services received by the taxpayer than does an income tax.  Further, because value added does not fluctuate as widely as net income, a VAT provides a more stable source of revenue than the corporate income tax.  <em>See generally</em> Kleine 3, figure 1.</p>\n<p>"The logic or rationale of the [VAT] rests squarely on the benefits received principle of taxation -- government services are essential to the operation of any business enterprise . . . and a part of these public service costs should properly be included in the cost of doing business."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The SBT Analysis 20-21, provides us the following simplified example of how value added is determined.  Assume a bakery\'s sole revenue comes from the sale of bread.  The bakery\'s costs consist of materials (flour, sugar, spices, utilities), labor (baker, sales clerk), capital (building, mixer, utensils, oven), and credit (interest paid on loans).  Any excess of revenues over costs represents profit.  Thus,</p>\n<p>Revenue = Cost of Labor + Cost of Materials</p>\n<p>+ Depreciation [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] + Interest + Profit</p>\n<p>Because value added is defined as the difference between the value of products sold (revenues), and the cost of materials going into the products, we can represent value added (for the entire firm) by a second simple equation: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 498 U. S. 365</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Value added = Revenues - Cost of Materials.</p>\n<p>The same result is reached by another common method.  If we subtract Cost of Materials from each side of the first equation above, we have:</p>\n<p>Revenues-Cost of Materials = Cost of Labor + Depreciation</p>\n<p>+ Interest + Profit.</p>\n<p>So in practice value added can be calculated as <em>either</em> Revenues-Cost of Materials <em>or</em> Cost of Labor + Depreciation + Interest + Profit.  Not surprisingly, these are referred to as the "subtraction" and the "addition" methods.  Each provides an identical measurement of a taxpayer\'s value added. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Once value added is determined, the VAT is assessed as a percentage of the value added for the relevant fiscal period.

After enactment of the SBT, the same manufacturer would pay only one tax.</p>\n<p>The Michigan SBT is an addition method VAT, although it inevitably permits various exclusions, exemptions, and adjustments that depart from the simple value-added examples described above.  Subject to exemptions contained at Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 208.35, Michigan SBT is levied against any person with "business activity" within the State of Michigan.  Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 208.31(1) (1979). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In order to calculate the amount of a taxpayer\'s SBT, the taxpayer must, first, determine its total tax base.  The total tax base consists of the taxpayer\'s value added, calculated by the addition method:  Cost of Labor + Depreciation + Interest + Profit.  Under Mich. Comp. Laws \xc2\xa7 208.9 (1979), the taxpayer begins with federal taxable income (representing profit), adds other elements that reflect consumption of labor and capital including compensation, depreciation, dividends, and interest paid by the taxpayer, and makes other detailed adjustments.</p>\n<p>Second, if a taxpayer does business both within and without Michigan, it must determine the portion of its total value added attributable to Michigan.  That portion, the crux of this case, is the average of three ratios:  (1) Michigan payroll </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 498 U. S. 368</a></p><p> to total payroll, (2) Michigan property to total property, and (3) Michigan sales to total sales.  Mich. Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 208.45, 208.46, 208.49, 208.51 (1979).  The total tax base is multiplied by the portion of business activity attributable to Michigan (under the three-factor formula), and the result, subject to several further adjustments, is the taxpayer\'s "adjusted tax base."  \xc2\xa7 208.31(2).</p>\n<p>Two further adjustments are relevant here:  \xc2\xa7 208.23(a), which permits a taxpayer to deduct a portion of its capital acquisitions, and \xc2\xa7 208.31(5), which permits a labor-intensive taxpayer to reduce its adjusted tax base by a percentage equal to the percentage by which compensation exceeds 63% of the total tax base, but with such reduction not to exceed a maximum of 37%.  Actual tax liability equals the adjusted tax base multiplied by a tax rate of 2.35%.

Its principal office is located in Maumee, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo located near the Michigan border.  During 1980, the tax year in question, Trinova maintained a fixed presence in Michigan:  a sales office of 14 employees who solicited orders, maintained contact with Trinova\'s Michigan customers, and performed clerical work.  Michigan, with its automobile industry, was a major market for Trinova\'s products.  Indeed, Trinova made $103,981,354 worth of sales to Michigan during 1980, 26.5892% of its total sales of $391,065,866.  Trinova calculated its 1980 SBT adjusted tax base as follows: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 498 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>U.

Trinova further adjusted its tax base by subtracting a capital acquisition deduction ($9,063) and by taking the maximum (37%) reduction for labor-intensive taxpayers.  These adjustments resulted in a 1980 adjusted tax base of $12,492,671.  When multiplied by the tax rate of 2.35%, Trinova\'s tax liability amounted to $293,578 ($12,492,671 x 2.35%).

S. 370</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1985, a Michigan intermediate court of appeals ruled that taxpayers similarly situated to Trinova were entitled to "relief" under Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 208.69 (1979), a provision of the SBT.  <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Department of Treasury,</em> 145 Mich.App. 405, 377 N.W.2d 397 (1985), <em>leave to appeal and reconsideration denied,</em> 424 Mich. 895 (1986).  At the time, \xc2\xa7 208.69 provided that, if the apportionment provisions of the SBT did not "fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\'s business activity" in Michigan, the taxpayer could, among other alternatives, petition for the employment of "any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\'s tax base."</p>\n<p>Soon after the decision in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin,</em> Trinova filed an amended return and refund claim for the 1980 tax year.  Based on the relief granted in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin,</em> Trinova proposed that, despite admitted company-wide value added of $221 million and Michigan sales of over $100 million, for purposes of the Michigan SBT it should be treated as if it had negative total value added.  Value-added apportioned to Michigan would also have been negative, and Trinova would have been entitled to a refund for its entire 1980 SBT payment.

The amended \xc2\xa7 208.69 creates a presumption that the statutory apportionment formula fairly represents the taxpayer\'s business activity in Michigan unless the adjusted tax base meets one of two tests, neither of which Trinova could satisfy, and which do not merit discussion here.  <em>See</em> Mich.Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7 208.69(3) (West Supp.1990).  The Court of Appeals referred to the legislature\'s statement that its act was intended</p>\n<p>"curative, expressing the original intent of the legislature that the single business tax . . . is an indivisible value-added type of tax and not a combination or series of several smaller taxes and that relief from formulary apportionment should be granted only under extraordinary circumstances."</p>\n<p>1987 Mich.Pub.Acts 39, \xc2\xa7 2.  Relying upon this language, the Court of Appeals determined that the amendment was to be given retroactive effect as a "remedial and procedural" statute, and that Trinova was not entitled to statutory relief.  166 Mich.App. 656, 666, 421 N.W.2d 258, 262 (1988).</p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals.  433 Mich. 141, 445 N.W.2d 428 (1989).  Without addressing retroactive application of the amendments to \xc2\xa7 208.69, it construed \xc2\xa7 208.69 as a "constitutional <em>circuit </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 498 U.

The court then upheld the SBT against Trinova\'s federal constitutional challenges.  The Michigan Supreme Court noted that formulary apportionment of income taxes is uncontroversial, and that it did\n</em></p>\n<p>"not believe that \'business activity\' as defined under the [SBT] is susceptible to accurate analysis when only one component of the total business effort is examined."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163, 445 N.W.2d at 438.  The court concluded that Trinova\'s averaged ratios of payroll, property and sales are a fair representation of the extent of its business activity in Michigan, making it ineligible for relief on statutory or constitutional grounds.  <em>Id.</em> at 163-166, 445 N.W.2d at 438-439.

Trinova instead contends that Michigan\'s SBT fails the other two prongs of the <em>Complete Auto</em> test:  that the SBT is not fairly apportioned as applied to Trinova, and that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce.  We consider these claims, and begin with the matter of apportionment.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Trinova\'s claim that apportionment of the tax is unconstitutional concentrates on the elements of the apportionment formula.  The original rationale for apportionment of income was the difficulty of identifying the geographic source of the income earned by a multistate enterprise.  <em>See Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/113/case.html">254 U.

S. 120</a></span>-121 (1920) (legislature "faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the [taxpayer\'s] processes conducted within its borders").  As we stated the problem in <em>Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html">463 U. S. 159</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html#192">463 U.

S. 374</a></p><p> bears some resemblance . . . to slicing a shadow."  Trinova argues that, because its SBT tax base is composed in large part of compensation and depreciation, elements which can be assigned to a geographic source, we must reject apportionment altogether.</p>\n<p>We can accept the premise that apportionment is permitted only when precise geographic measurement is not feasible, for to allow apportionment where there is no practical or theoretical justification could provide the opportunity for a state to export tax burdens and import tax revenues.  The Commerce Clause prohibits this competitive mischief.  The issue becomes whether, without an apportionment formula, Michigan can assign the SBT tax base and its principal components to separate geographic locations and to separate accounts in each state.  Michigan has decided it cannot do so without serious theoretical and practical difficulty, and, upon review of the case, we accept that determination.</p>\n<p>We reject, at the outset, however, arguments by Michigan and some <em>amici curiae</em> that the Michigan SBT can be analyzed as a tax upon "business activity."  Brief for Council of State Governments <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11.  The statute does not say that the SBT is a tax upon business activity, but rather that it is a "tax of 2.35% <em>upon the adjusted tax base of every person with business activity in this state which is allocated or apportioned to this state.</em>"  Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 208.31(1) (1979) (emphasis added).  While Michigan business activity is a threshold requirement for the tax, and value added is its measure, labeling the SBT a tax on "business activity" does not permit us to forgo examination of the actual tax base and apportionment provisions.  "A tax on sleeping measured by the number of pairs of shoes you have in your closet is a tax on shoes."  Jenkins, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce, 27 Tenn.L.Rev. 239, 242 (1960).</p>\n<p>Trinova errs in the opposite direction.  It would dissect the tax base as if the SBT were three separate and independent taxes:  a tax on compensation, a tax on depreciation, and a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 498 U. S. 375</a></p><p> tax on income, each apportioned.  Trinova insists that compensation and depreciation can be located, and can be separated from the total value-added calculation.  As a result, Trinova would be taxed upon its Michigan compensation and Michigan depreciation.  It would owe no additional tax upon income apportionable to Michigan, because it had no income during the relevant tax year.</p>\n<p>This characterization, and with it Trinova\'s constitutional argument, fails.  Doubtless Trinova can identify the location of its plant and equipment, and much of its compensation.  The Michigan SBT, however, is not three separate and independent taxes, and Trinova cannot purport to identify the geographic source of value added by assuming that two elements can be located in a single state while the third cannot.  Trinova\'s proposed apportionment for the 1980 tax year, n. 8, <em>supra,</em> provides a good example of the problems that accompany its argument.</p>\n<p>In 1980, Trinova\'s company-wide value added amounted to much less than its compensation plus depreciation.  In short, Trinova was unprofitable.  Under a VAT, however, tax becomes due in any event.  Trinova\'s approach would require us to conclude that Trinova added value at the factory through the consumption of capital and labor, but that its products somehow lost value outside of this process, perhaps between the time they left the factory and the time they were delivered to customers in Michigan.  This approach is incompatible with the rationale of a VAT, and is unsupported in the record.</p>\n<p>For all this record shows, Trinova\'s production operations might have added little value and its sales offices might have added significant value, through superior marketing skill, liaison between the company and its customers, or mere fortuity.  <em>See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/case.html">437 U. S. 267</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/case.html#272">437 U. S. 272</a></span> (1978) (record lacked analysis of what portion of profits was apportionable to sales, to manufacturing or to other phase of company\'s operations). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 498 U. S. 376</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But we need not rely upon Trinova\'s 14 Michigan sales personnel as the source of all the value added that can be apportioned fairly to Michigan.  In a unitary enterprise, compensation, depreciation and profit are not independent variables to be adjusted without reference to each other.  If Trinova had paid an additional $100 million in compensation during 1980, there is no way of knowing whether, or to what extent, value added would have increased.  In fact, value added would not have increased, so long as revenues did not increase.  These elements of value added are inextricable, codependent variables.</p>\n<p>Without Trinova\'s $100 million in 1980 Michigan sales, the company\'s value added would have been lower to a remarkable degree.  The market demand that sustained those sales did not arise solely, perhaps not even substantially, from the activities of Trinova\'s 14 Michigan sales personnel.  But there can be little doubt that requirements of the Michigan market determined the direction of Trinova\'s design, production and distribution process.  By serving that market and meeting its demands, Trinova generated value added in the sums that it did.  We can and must assume that Michigan sales were a part of the company\'s essential economic strategies, and were an integral part of company-wide value added.  It distorts the tax both in application and theory to confine value-added consequences of the Michigan market solely to the labor and capital expended by the resident sales force.</p>\n<p>Trinova\'s attempted characterization is arguable only because Michigan calculates value added by the addition method.  The addition and subtraction methods of calculating value, however, are but two different paths to the same result.  <em>See</em> n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  Had Michigan calculated the SBT tax base by the subtraction method, reporting total revenues minus total cost of materials, Trinova\'s characterization would collapse of its own weight.  Trinova could geographically locate its revenues, and even determine where it purchased its materials.  The Michigan apportionment formula </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 498 U. S. 377</a></p><p> assumes as much.  But were Trinova to calculate value added based upon the location of its revenues, it would apportion a much greater share of its value added to Michigan (26.5892%) than was apportioned under Michigan\'s three-factor formula (8.9717%).  An apportionment of value added based solely on the source of revenues is no less justifiable than an apportionment based solely upon the location of compensation or depreciation.</p>\n<p>The difference between the addition and subtraction methods is one of form, and lacks constitutional significance.  Michigan chose the addition method of calculating value added as a convenience to taxpayers, for whom federal taxable income provided an easy starting point.  Kleine 6-7 (discussing advantages of addition method); SBT Analysis 21 (same).  The Constitution does not require a formalistic analysis resulting in a penalty for Michigan\'s selection of an easier calculation method for its taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Both methods of calculation, moreover, illustrate the justification for the State\'s adoption of an apportionment formula.  Under either method, value added includes a remainder or residual that cannot be located with economic precision.  Under the addition method, value added contains the element of income, one calculated by and dependent upon factors (revenues minus total costs) not included in the addition method equation; under the subtraction method, value added is itself a remainder, no more assignable than income.  It would be impractical to locate value added by a geographic test.  We thus agree with the Michigan Legislature\'s statement that the SBT is not, for apportionment purposes, "a combination or series of several smaller taxes," 1987 Mich.Pub.Acts 39, \xc2\xa7 2, but an "indivisible," <em>ibid.,</em> tax upon a different, bona fide measure of business activity, the value added.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is no different than the one we have reached in upholding the validity of state apportionment of income taxes.  As with a VAT, the discrete components of a state income tax may appear in isolation susceptible of geographic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 498 U. S. 378</a></p><p> designation.  Nevertheless, since <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/113/case.html">254 U. S. 113</a></span> (1920), we have recognized the impracticability of assuming that all income can be assigned to a single source.  In this respect, Trinova\'s argument becomes a familiar and often-rejected genre of taxpayer challenge:</p>\n<p>"[A]pportionability often has been challenged by the contention that . . . the source of [particular] income may be ascertained by separate geographical accounting.  The Court has rejected that contention so long as the intrastate and extrastate activities formed part of a single unitary business.  <em>Butler Bros. v.

The three-factor formula is widely used, and is included in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, 7A U.L.A. 331 (1990 Cum.Supp.) (approved in 1957 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Bar Association).</p>\n<p>Trinova argues that, on the facts of this case, the three-factor formula leads to a distorted result, out of all proportion to the business done by Trinova in Michigan.  Trinova\'s Michigan payroll constituted .2328% of total payroll, its Michigan property constituted .0930% of total property, and its Michigan sales constituted 26.5892% of total sales.  The three-factor formula averages these ratios, with the result that 8.9717% of Trinova\'s value added, or $19,838,700, is assigned to Michigan.  Because Trinova is a labor-intensive taxpayer, and can deduct capital acquisitions, the tax base is further reduced to $12,492,671.</p>\n<p>In this Court, Trinova proposes an alternative two-factor apportionment, excluding the sales factor.

Trinova\'s position finds some support among economists.  <em>See</em> Barlow &amp; Connell, The Single Business Tax, in Michigan\'s Fiscal and Economic Structure 673, 704 (H.

We further reject this critique because it cannot distinguish application of the three-factor formula to a VAT from application to an income tax.  In fact, nearly identical criticisms were levied against the three-factor formula as a method for apportioning income by economists who theorize that income (like value added) is the product of labor and capital, and that the marketplace contributes nothing to production of income.  <em>See</em> Studenski, The Need for Federal Curbs on State Taxes on Interstate Commerce:  An Economist\'s Viewpoint, 46 Va.L.Rev. 1121, 1131-1132 (1960); Harriss, Economic Aspects of Interstate Apportionment of Business Income, 37 Taxes 327, 362-363 (1959); Harriss, Interstate Apportionment of Business Income, 49 Am.Econ.Rev. 398, 400 (1959).  If it were not for their age, these criticisms could have been taken almost verbatim from Trinova\'s brief: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 498 U.

Taken by themselves, they do not necessarily represent the location of the company\'s productive income-creating effort.

S. 183</a></span>.  Thus, as we responded to a similar argument in <em>Moorman Mfg. Co.,</em> whatever the merit of Trinova\'s argument that sales do not contribute to value added,</p>\n<p>"from the standpoint of economic theory or legislative policy, it cannot support a claim in this litigation that [the State] in fact taxed profits not attributable to activities within the State during the yea[r 1980]."</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/case.html#272">437 U. S. 272</a></span>.  Trinova gives no basis for distinguishing the same arguments that were pressed, and rejected, with regard to the apportionment of income.  We could not accept Trinova\'s argument that the sales factor distorts Michigan\'s apportionment formula without rejecting our precedents which approve the use of the same formula to apportion income.</p>\n<p>As we find no distortion caused by the three-factor formula, it follows that the Michigan SBT does not tax "value earned outside [Michigan\'s] borders."  <em>ASARCO Inc. v.

The argument that the value was added in Ohio, by labor and capital, and that no value has been added in Michigan, assumes that value added is subject to geographic ascertainment, and assumes further the inappropriateness of a sales factor in apportionment.  For the reasons we have given, we reject both arguments. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 498 U.

Trinova has not convincingly demonstrated which figure is most accurate.  Trinova gives no estimate of the value added that would take account of both its Michigan sales activity and Michigan market demand for its products.  Michigan, on the other hand, has consistently applied a formula, the elements of which appear to reflect a very large share of the activities by which value is generated, with further relief for labor intensive taxpayers such as Trinova.  Trinova has failed to meet its burden of proving "by <em>clear and cogent evidence,\'" <em>Moorman Mfg.

The content of that requirement is fair apportionment.  The "deeper meaning" to which American Trucking refers is embodied in the requirement of fair apportionment, as expressed in the tests of internal and external consistency.  Other than the vague accusation of discrimination, Trinova presents no other standard by which we might consider the constitutionality of the Michigan SBT.</p>\n<p>In further support of its discrimination argument, Trinova relies upon the 1987 statement of Michigan\'s Governor that the SBT was enacted "<em>to promote the development and investment of business within Michigan.\'"  Executive Message of Michigan Governor James J.

Although Trinova repeats the Governor\'s statement in an attempt to demonstrate an impermissible motive on the part of the State, all the contemporaneous evidence concerning passage of the SBT suggests a benign motivation, combined with a practical need to increase revenues.

Under the EEC system, the bakery in our example would be taxed on each sale of bread, and would receive a credit for each purchase of materials going into production of the bread.  Similarly, at each other link in the chain of production and distribution, tax is assessed on sales, but credit is provided on purchases.  This multi-stage sales tax system places the burden on the taxpayer to demonstrate that it did, in fact, purchase goods for which it requests a credit.  The multi-stage sales tax version of the VAT has been advocated as promoting tax compliance, though the evidence does not necessarily support this view.  <em>See</em> Oldman &amp; Woods, Would a Value-Added Tax System Relieve Tax Compliance Problems, in Income Tax Compliance:  A Report of the ABA Section of Taxation Invitational Conference on Income Tax Compliance 317 (1983) (multistage consumption tax VAT has traditionally been regarded as self-enforcing because the tax credit mechanism is said to induce firms to report transactions accurately).</p>\n<p>The requirement of "fiscal frontiers" to record and tax interstate transactions makes the multistage sales tax approach impracticable for an individual state.

As a result, no tax is applied on exports, while full tax is applied to imports.  <em>See id.</em> at 1024-1025; Aaron 4.

While we accept the analogy Michigan has drawn between a VAT and an income tax, we recognize that the SBT also bears some similarities to a gross receipts tax.

S. 373</a></span>.  The only issue, then, is whether the tax violates the Due Process Clause by taxing extraterritorial values.  For the reasons stated in Parts III-A and III-B of the Court\'s opinion, I agree that it does not. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="388">Page 498 U. S. 388</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Although the parties refer to Michigan\'s "Single Business Tax" (SBT) as a "Value Added Tax" (VAT), that term does not appear in the text of the statute.  The text of the relevant Act describes the SBT as a tax on "certain commercial, business, and financial activities." [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  As a practical matter, Michigan\'s SBT is nothing more than an amalgam of three separate taxes:  a tax on payroll, a tax on depreciable fixed assets, and a tax on income.  Payroll and depreciation represent over 90 percent of the SBT tax base, and the productive activities that are measured by payroll and depreciation take place at geographic locations that are readily identifiable.  Because Michigan\'s SBT uses an apportionment formula to tax a portion of those activities occurring outside Michigan, I depart from the Court\'s analysis and conclude that the state taxation scheme violates established principles of due process.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Trinova\'s executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Ohio.  Most of its employees live and work in Ohio.  In fact, significantly less than one percent of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 498 U. S. 389</a></p><p> Trinova\'s capital assets and labor were employed in Michigan in 1980. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The company operated at a substantial loss in that year.  The question presented is whether the fact that 26 percent of Trinova\'s unprofitable sales were made to Michigan customers provides a constitutionally sufficient justification for the State to attribute to Michigan (and thus to tax) approximately nine percent of Trinova\'s productive activities, almost all of which actually occurred in Ohio.</p>\n<p>In upholding the constitutionality of the SBT against a Due Process Clause challenge, the Court today concludes that, even though the bulk of Trinova\'s property and payroll are located outside Michigan, it does not follow that the bulk of its value-adding activities are located outside Michigan, and thus are not attributable to or taxable by Michigan.  Rather, the Court assumes that the value added to a product is largely contingent upon the revenue that the product generates when it is sold in the marketplace.  Because the value added by Trinova\'s use of labor and capital in Ohio is not realized until Trinova\'s product is sold in Michigan and the product is given market value by consumers, the Court concludes that Michigan\'s sales contribute greatly to the value of Trinova\'s product, and thus that allowing a portion of the value added by Trinova\'s business activities in Ohio to be attributed to Michigan through use of an apportionment formula is justified.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s assumption that value added from labor and capital is not realized until the product is sold, however, is simply wrong.  Finished goods, even though stored in a warehouse and not yet sold, are more valuable than raw materials.  Moreover, under the Michigan statute, the revenues generated by the sales of the finished product are reflected in the net income component of the tax base.  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 498 U. S. 390</a></p><p> in this case, because Trinova operated at a loss, the value added by labor and capital is reduced, rather than enhanced, by the ultimate sales made in Michigan.  It necessarily follows that allowing Michigan to apportion out-of-state expenses incurred for fixed assets and labor on the basis of Michigan sales in effect allows Michigan to tax extraterritorial business activity.</p>\n<p>Under this Court\'s due process jurisprudence, a State may constitutionally tax only those interstate business activities or income to which it has a rational nexus.  <em>See Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html">463 U.

However, in the context of state income taxes on "unitary" interstate businesses, our cases allow States to deviate from the fixed rule of geographic accounting in favor of a more flexible system of formulary apportionment.  In so doing, we have cautioned that</p>\n<p>"[t]he functional meaning of this requirement [of a rational nexus between the taxing State and the taxed activities] is that there be some sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise [geographic] identification or measurement . . . which renders formula apportionment a reasonable method of taxation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html#166">463 U. S. 166</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court today extends its analysis upholding the constitutionality of income apportionment as an exception to the general rule of geographic accounting to situations in which the original justification for the use of an imprecise apportionment formula no longer holds.  Unlike the income of a unitary business, which we before have recognized may not be precisely allocated, the two principal elements of Michigan\'s SBT -- property and payroll -- are subject to precise geographic identification, and thus do not warrant being subject to an apportionment formula.</p>\n<p>The Court concedes, as it must, that far less than one percent of Trinova\'s capital assets and labor were employed in Michigan in 1980, but rejects the logical result of such analysis by concluding that it does not necessarily follow that far less than one percent of Trinova\'s "value added" can be precisely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 498 U. S. 391</a></p><p> identified as having been realized outside Michigan.  Instead, the Court concludes that the value added by Trinova\'s factors of production located outside of Michigan cannot be precisely determined until the ultimate product is sold and the market value or revenue that the product commands is considered.  As the Court states,</p>\n<p>"[t]he Michigan SBT . . . is not three separate and independent taxes, and Trinova cannot purport to identify the geographic source of value added by assuming that two elements can be located in a single state, while the third cannot."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/358/case.html#375">498 U. S. 375</a></span>.  Rather,</p>\n<p>"[i]n a unitary enterprise, compensation, depreciation and profit are not independent variables to be adjusted without reference to each other.  If Trinova had paid an additional $100 million in compensation during 1980, there is no way of knowing whether, or to what extent, value added would have increased.  <em>In fact, value added would not have increased so long as revenues did not increase.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/358/case.html#376">498 U. S. 376</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Driving the Court\'s analysis is the recognition that Trinova in 1980 netted a loss of over $42 million.  This, the Court concludes, means that the ultimate value added by Trinova\'s use of labor and capital resources was not equivalent to its actual payroll and capital expenses.  Resisting the perceived awkwardness of finding</p>\n<p>"that Trinova added value at the factory through the consumption of capital and labor, but that its products somehow lost value outside of this process,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/358/case.html#375">498 U. S. 375</a></span>, the Court holds that the value added by capital and labor should not be deemed to be realized and should not be geographically assigned until Trinova\'s product is sold, and that the measure of value added by payroll and capital expenses should be adjusted by the ultimate revenue the product generates.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s assumption that value added by property and payroll is not realized and cannot be determined until the product is sold is belied by the rationale underlying the VAT.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 498 U. S. 392</a></p><p> The</p>\n<p>"concept of value added . . . is derived from the most basic of economic facts -- the scarcity of resources -- and hence consistently measures the amount of scarce labor and capital resources used up (and not available for use elsewhere) in every economic activity."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Haughey, The Economic Logic of the Single Business Tax, 22 Wayne L.Rev. 1017, 1018 (1976).  That a product is ultimately unprofitable does not diminish the amount of resources a company utilized in manufacturing the product.  Nor does the value added to the economy or gross national product by the company\'s purchase of labor and utilization of capital diminish when the product is not sold or is sold for a net loss.</p>\n<p>Rather, value added is fully realized at each stage of the production process -- at the stages where labor services are sold and paid for by the company in the form of payroll expenses and where capital is consumed.  The amount of value added at these intermediate stages of production is the price paid for the labor services and for the capital expended.  <em>See ibid.</em> (value added may be determined by "add[ing] up all of the payments paid internally to the owners of the labor and capital used").  Regardless of the profitability (or unprofitability) of the ultimate product, value added by labor and capital is not eliminated or diminished if the ultimate product is unable to command equivalent value or revenue in the marketplace. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  As the Court itself concedes early in its opinion, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 498 U. S. 393</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[e]ven if a business entity is unprofitable, under normal circumstances it adds value to its products and, as a consequence, will owe some VAT."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/358/case.html#364">498 U. S. 364</a></span>.  This immunity of the VAT base from the vagaries of the marketplace is the basic justification for the SBT:</p>\n<p>"[B]ecause value added does not fluctuate as widely as net income, a VAT provides a more stable source of revenue than the corporate income tax."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Concededly, under the Michigan statute, the task of calculating precisely Trinova\'s value added by its capital and labor resources without looking to its ultimate sales or profit is complicated by the unprofitability of Trinova\'s business during the years in question.  Under Michigan\'s method for calculating the SBT tax base, the corporation\'s profit is added to the sum of labor costs and capital expenditures (consisting of depreciation and interest expenses) and represents the value added by the corporation\'s skill and entrepreneurial effort.  Insofar as Trinova in 1980 netted a loss of over $42 million, Trinova\'s value added tax base was actually reduced by "addition" of its profit to its labor and capital costs.</p>\n<p>It is nevertheless clear that value added under the additive method is realized at each stage of the production process, and is undiminished if the product suffers a net loss.  That Michigan chooses to allow a company\'s value added tax base to be reduced by the extent of its unprofitability does not in any way lead to the Court\'s conclusion that the value added by labor and capital is not realized when (and where) those resources are purchased, and that the amount of that value added to the economy is not equivalent to the price paid by the company for those resources.</p>\n<p>Because the value added by the two principal components of Michigan\'s SBT -- labor and capital -- are fully realized, and thus can be precisely quantified and geographically assigned, when the actual purchase of labor services and use of capital occur, Michigan\'s apportionment of a company\'s entire payroll and capital expenses results in the unconstitutional taxation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 498 U. S. 394</a></p><p> by Michigan of a portion of the taxpayer\'s extraterritorial activities. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  In fact, in Trinova\'s case, although less than one percent of Trinova\'s property and payroll expenses are incurred within its borders, Michigan, by applying the apportionment formula to payroll and capital, treats nine to ten percent of Trinova\'s labor and capital costs as if they were in-state expenses. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Because such extraterritorial taxation violates basic principles of due process, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The preamble to the statute states, in part:</p>\n<p>"AN ACT to provide for the imposition, levy, computation, collection, assessment and enforcement, by lien or otherwise, of taxes on certain commercial, business, and financial activities. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 208.1, p. 4 (1986).</p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court\'s explanation of the significance of the label "value added tax" describes it as a tax upon business activity.
