CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>This suit was brought by the plaintiff, a merchant of Pennsylvania, against the defendant, a merchant of Maryland, upon an account which grew out of their trade with each other as merchants.  The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, to which the plaintiff replied that the plaintiff, who resided in the State of Pennsylvania, and the defendant were employed in mutual trade and merchandise, of and concerning which the said several sums of money in the said declaration mentioned grew due.  The defendant rejoins that the plaintiff came within the State of Maryland in 1797, and that the original writ in this cause issued on 5 July, 1808, and not before.  The plaintiff demurred, and upon argument the demurrer was overruled and the bar adjudged to be good.</p>\n<p>A writ of error has been sued out to the judgment of the circuit court, and the questions in the cause are</p>\n<p>1. Is the replication good in itself?</p>\n<p>2. Does the rejoinder avoid the replication and sustain the plea.</p>\n<p>These questions depend on the act of limitations passed in 1715 by the Legislature of Maryland.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 11 U. S. 353</a></p><p> material part of that act is in these words:</p>\n<p>"Be it enacted that all actions . . . other than such accounts as concerns the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants which are not residents within this province . . . shall be commenced or sued within three years ensuing the cause of such action, and not after."</p>\n<p>By the plaintiffs it is contended that if either party reside without the province, the case is within the exception; by the defendant that to bring the case within the exception both parties must reside without the province.</p>\n<p>It is so unusual for a legislature to employ itself in framing rules which are to operate only on contracts made without their jurisdiction between persons residing without their jurisdiction that courts can never be justified in putting such a construction on their words if they admit of any other interpretation which is rational and not too much strained.</p>\n<p>This, it is thought, may be done in the case now to be decided.  The words "which are not residents" refer, it is said, to both parties, plaintiff and defendant.  They comprehend all the persons previously enumerated.  Let this be conceded.</p>\n<p>Then read the exception as if the word "both" or "all" were inserted.  It will stand thus:</p>\n<p>"other than such accounts as concerns the trade or merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants which are not both or all residents within this province."</p>\n<p>The plain meaning of the sentence so read would be that accounts between merchant and merchant. either of whom resided out of the province. would come within the exception.  It is admitted that without the word "both" or "all," the more obvious meaning of the sentence is that for which the defendant contends.  Yet it will bear the same construction without as with either of those words, and the subject matter of the law so clearly requires this interpretation that the Court thinks it may be made.</p>\n<p>The rejoinder is founded on the third section of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 11 U. S. 354</a></p><p> act which contains the usual exceptions in favor of infants, &amp;c., and allows three years after the removal of the impediment to bring their suit.</p>\n<p>It is contended that since the act of limitations runs against a person beyond sea from the time of his coming into the country, so from analogy it ought to run against a nonresident merchant from the time of his coming, though for a mere temporary purpose, within the country.</p>\n<p>The Court cannot assent to the correctness of this reasoning.  To render it applicable, the rejoinder ought to have averred that the plaintiff had become a resident of the State of Maryland more than three years before the institution of the suit.  Not having done so, the words of the exception have never ceased to be applicable to the plaintiff, and consequently the statute has never commenced to run.</p>\n<p>It is the opinion of this Court that the circuit court erred in overruling the demurrer of the plaintiff to the rejoinder of the defendant in this cause, and that the judgment be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded with instructions to render judgment on the said demurrer in favor of the plaintiff, and that further proceedings may be had therein according to law.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
