S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (<em>Avena</em>), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated Article 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention) by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals, including petitioner Medell\xc3\xadn, of their Vienna Convention rights.  The ICJ found that those named individuals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their U. S. state-court convictions and sentences regardless of their failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.  In <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, 548 U. S. 331\xe2\x80\x94issued after <em>Avena </em>but involving individuals who were not named in the <em>Avena</em> judgment\xe2\x80\x94this Court held, contrary to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s determination, that the Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules.  The President then issued a memorandum (President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum or Memorandum) stating that the United States would \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge its international obligations\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Avena</em> \xe2\x80\x9cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on <em>Avena </em>and<em> </em>the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum, Medell\xc3\xadn filed a second Texas state-court habeas application challenging his state capital murder conviction and death sentence on the ground that he had not been informed of his Vienna Convention rights.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application as an abuse of the writ, concluding that neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on filing successive habeas applications.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9337.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The <em>Avena</em> judgment is not directly enforceable as domestic law in state court.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9327. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0While a treaty may constitute an international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d and is ratified on that basis.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 314.  The <em>Avena</em> judgment creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sources\xe2\x80\x94the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute\xe2\x80\x94creates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such legislation has been enacted. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision, does not commit signatories to comply therewith, and is silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach \xe2\x80\xa6 Member \xe2\x80\xa6 undertakes to comply with the [ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s] decision \xe2\x80\xa6 in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d is simply a commitment by member states to take future action through their political branches.  That language does not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is confirmed by Article 94(2)\xe2\x80\x94the enforcement provision\xe2\x80\x94which provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the U.\xc2\xa0N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an express diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts.  See <em>Sanchez</em>-<em>Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 347.  Even this \xe2\x80\x9cquintessentially <em>international</em> remed[y],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security Council resolution, and the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any such resolution.  Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ICJ Statute, by limiting disputes to those involving nations, not individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force except between those nations, provides further evidence that the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not automatically constitute federal law enforceable in U. S. courts.  Medell\xc3\xadn, an individual, cannot be considered a party to the <em>Avena </em>decision.  Finally, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of a treaty \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled to great weight,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, 457 U. S., at 184\xe2\x80\x93185, and the Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9317. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The foregoing interpretive approach\xe2\x80\x94parsing a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s text to determine if it is self-executing\xe2\x80\x94is hardly novel.  This Court has long looked to the language of a treaty to determine whether the President who negotiated it and the Senate that ratified it intended for the treaty to automatically create domestically enforceable federal law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Foster,</em> <em>supra.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>Avena </em>does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the \xe2\x80\x9cpostratification understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of signatory countries.  See <em>Zicherman</em> v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/217/index.html">516 U. S. 217</a>, 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medell\xc3\xadn nor his <em>amici</em> have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.  The lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344, and n.\xc2\xa03.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  Given that the forum state\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rules govern a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s implementation absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, see <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 351, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated any intent to give ICJ judgments such effect.  There is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports this notion.  Moreover, the consequences of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s argument give pause: neither Texas nor this Court may look behind an ICJ decision and quarrel with its reasoning or result, despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>that<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the [ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s] structure or purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on  our courts.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 354.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments.   An agreement to abide by the result of an international adjudication can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Medell\xc3\xadn contends that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments, but the judgment Medell\xc3\xadn asks us to enforce is hardly typical: It would enjoin the operation of state law and force the State to take action to \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconside[r]\xe2\x80\x9d his case.  Foreign judgments awarding injunctive relief against private parties, let alone sovereign States, \xe2\x80\x9care not generally entitled to enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7481, Comment <em>b,</em> p. 595 (1986).

Pp. 27\xe2\x80\x9337.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The President seeks to vindicate plainly compelling interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law.  But those interests do not allow the Court to set aside first principles.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, \xe2\x80\x9cmust stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a>, 585. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s familiar tripartite scheme provides the accepted framework for evaluating executive action in this area.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 637.  In such a circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court can sustain his actions \xe2\x80\x9conly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.  Pp.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9329. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.  The United States argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the <em>Avena</em> judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d international dispute-resolution power.  We find these arguments, as well as Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s additional argument that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his \xe2\x80\x9cTake Care\xe2\x80\x9d power, unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9337.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is implicitly authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter.  But the responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress, not the Executive.  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 315.  It is a fundamental constitutional principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hamdan </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 548 U. S. 557, 591.  A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the President\xe2\x80\x94acting on his own\xe2\x80\x94to achieve precisely the same result.  Accordingly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.  Indeed, because the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so, the President\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of authority is within <em>Youngstown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s third category, not the first or even the second.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that congressional acquiescence requires that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum be given effect as domestic law.  But such acquiescence is pertinent when the President\xe2\x80\x99s action falls within the second <em>Youngstown </em>category, not the third.  In any event, congressional acquiescence does not exist here.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to act following the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of prior ICJ controversies does not demonstrate acquiescence because in none of those prior controversies did the President assert the authority to transform an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displace state law.  The United States\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d statutory responsibilities and on his \xe2\x80\x9cestablished role\xe2\x80\x9d in litigating foreign policy concerns is also misplaced.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s statutory authorization to represent the United States before the U.\xc2\xa0N., the ICJ, and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Security Council speaks to his <em>international</em> responsibilities, not to any unilateral authority to create domestic law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation does not preclude the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation by other means, so long as those means are consistent with the Constitution.  But the President may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9335.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The United States also claims that\xe2\x80\x94independent of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations\xe2\x80\x94the Memorandum is a valid exercise of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>American Ins. Assn.</em> v. <em>Garamendi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/396/index.html">539 U. S. 396</a>, 415.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  They are based on the view that \xe2\x80\x9ca systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned,\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9craise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dames &amp; Moore </em>v. <em>Regan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/654/index.html">453 U. S. 654</a>, 668.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ast practice does not, by itself, create power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum\xe2\x80\x94a directive issued to state courts that would compel those courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws\xe2\x80\x94is not supported by a \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly longstanding practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Executive\xe2\x80\x99s limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far.

In the<em> Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals</em> (<em>Mex.</em> v. <em>U. S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (<em>Avena</em>), that tribunal considered a claim brought by Mexico against the United States.  The ICJ held that, based on violations of the Vienna Convention, 51 named Mexican nationals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their state-court convictions and sentences in the United States.  This was so regardless of any forfeiture of the right to raise Vienna Convention claims because of a failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, 548 U. S. 331 (2006)\xe2\x80\x94issued after <em>Avena </em>but involving individuals who were not named in the <em>Avena</em> judgment\xe2\x80\x94we held that, contrary to the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s determination, the Vienna Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules.  After the <em>Avena </em>decision, President George W. Bush determined, through a Memorandum to the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 187a (Memorandum or President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum), that the United States would \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge its international obligations\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Avena</em> \xe2\x80\x9cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Jos\xc3\xa9 Ernesto Medell\xc3\xadn, who had been convicted and sentenced in Texas state court for murder, is one of the 51 Mexican nationals named in the <em>Avena</em> decision.  Relying on the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision and<em> </em>the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum, Medell\xc3\xadn filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in state court.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s application as an abuse of the writ under state law, given Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise his Vienna Convention claim in a timely manner under state law.  We granted certiorari to decide two questions.  <em>First</em>, is the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in<em> Avena</em> directly enforceable as domestic law in a state court in the United States?  <em>Second</em>, does the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum independently require the States to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals named in <em>Avena</em> without regard to state procedural default rules?  We conclude that neither <em>Avena</em> nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.

The ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction in any particular case, however, is dependent upon the consent of the parties.  See Art. 36, 59 Stat. 1060.  The ICJ Statute delineates two ways in which a nation may consent to ICJ jurisdiction: It may consent generally to jurisdiction on any question arising under a treaty or general international law, Art. 36(2), <em>ibid.</em>, or it may consent specifically to jurisdiction over a particular category of cases or disputes pursuant to a separate treaty, Art. 36(1), <em>ibid</em>.  The United States originally consented to the general jurisdiction of the ICJ when it filed a declaration recognizing compulsory jurisdiction under Art. 36(2) in 1946.  The United States withdrew from general ICJ jurisdiction in 1985.  See U. S. Dept. of State Letter and Statement Concerning Termination of Acceptance of ICJ Compulsory Jurisdiction (Oct. 7, 1985), reprinted in 24 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0M. 1742 (1985).  By ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention, the United States consented to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention.

In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, neither the <em>Avena</em> decision nor the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum was \xe2\x80\x9cbinding federal law\xe2\x80\x9d that could displace the State\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on the filing of successive habeas applications.  <em>Ibid</em>.

He argues that \xe2\x80\x9cby virtue of the Supremacy Clause, the treaties requiring compliance with the <em>Avena</em> judgment are <em>already</em> the \xe2\x80\x98Law of the Land\xe2\x80\x99 by which all state and federal courts in this country are \xe2\x80\x98bound.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 1.  Accordingly, Medell\xc3\xadn argues, <em>Avena</em> is a binding federal rule of decision that pre-empts contrary state limitations on successive habeas petitions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one disputes that the <em>Avena </em>decision\xe2\x80\x94a decision that flows from the treaties through which the United States submitted to ICJ jurisdiction with respect to Vienna Convention disputes\xe2\x80\x94constitutes an <em>international</em> law obligation on the part of the United States.  But not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in United States courts.  The question we confront here is whether the <em>Avena</em> judgment has automatic <em>domestic</em> legal effect such that the judgment of its own force applies in state and federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has long recognized the distinction between treaties that automatically have effect as domestic law, and those that\xe2\x80\x94while they constitute international law commitments\xe2\x80\x94do not by themselves function as binding federal law.  The distinction was well explained by Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 315 (1829), overruled on other grounds, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet. 51 (1833), which held that a treaty is \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to an act of the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence self-executing, when it \xe2\x80\x9coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314.  When, in contrast, \xe2\x80\x9c[treaty] stipulations are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Whitney</em> v. <em>Robertson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/124/190/index.html">124 U. S. 190</a>, 194 (1888).  In sum, while treaties \xe2\x80\x9cmay comprise international commitments . . . they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \xe2\x80\x98self-executing\xe2\x80\x99 and is ratified on these terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Igart\xc3\xbaa-De La Rosa</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 145, 150 (CA1 2005) (en banc) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J.).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A treaty is, of course, \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily a compact between independent nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Head Money Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/112/580/index.html">112 U.

The Protocol provides: \xe2\x80\x9cDisputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T., at 326.  Of course, submitting to jurisdiction and agreeing to be bound are two different things.  A party could, for example, agree to compulsory nonbinding arbitration.  Such an agreement would require the party to appear before the arbitral tribunal without obligating the party to treat the tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s decision as binding.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, North American Free Trade Agreement, U.

It provides only that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay accordingly be brought before the [ICJ] . . . by any party to the dispute being a Party to the present Protocol.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, 21 U.

The Protocol is similarly silent as to any enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The obligation on the part of signatory nations to comply with ICJ judgments derives not from the Optional Protocol, but rather from Article 94 of the United Nations Charter\xe2\x80\x94the provision that specifically addresses the effect of ICJ decisions.  Article 94(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Member of the United Nations <em>undertakes to comply</em> with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  59 Stat. 1051 (emphasis added).  The Executive Branch contends that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9can acknowledgement that an ICJ decision will have immediate legal effect in the courts of U.\xc2\xa0N. members,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>commitment</em> on the part of U.\xc2\xa0N.

The Article is not a directive to domestic courts.  It does not provide that the United States \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d comply with an ICJ decision, nor indicate that the Senate that ratified the U.\xc2\xa0N.

Charter and the declaration accepting general compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, The Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 124\xe2\x80\x93125 (1945) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a state fails to perform its obligations under a judgment of the [ICJ], the other party may have recourse to the Security Council\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 286 (statement of Leo Paslovsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for International Organizations and Security Affairs) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the parties refuses to accept it, then the dispute becomes political rather than legal.

His construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.  Those sensitive foreign policy decisions would instead be transferred to state and federal courts charged with applying an ICJ judgment directly as domestic law.  And those courts would not be empowered to decide whether to comply with the judgment\xe2\x80\x94again, always regarded as an option by the political branches\xe2\x80\x94any more than courts may consider whether to comply with any other species of domestic law.  This result would be particularly anomalous in light of the principle that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he conduct of the foreign relations of our Government is committed by the Constitution to the Executive and Legislative\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98the political\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oetjen</em> v. <em>Central Leather Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/246/297/index.html">246 U.

Charter, provides further evidence that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> does not automatically constitute federal law judicially enforceable in United States courts.  Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.  To begin with, the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal purpose\xe2\x80\x9d is said to be to \xe2\x80\x9carbitrate particular disputes between national governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra</em>, at 355 (citing 59 Stat. 1055).  Accordingly, the ICJ can hear disputes only between nations, not individuals.  Art. 34(1), 59 Stat. 1059 (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly states [<em>i.e.,</em> countries] may be parties in cases before the [ICJ]\xe2\x80\x9d).  More important, Article 59 of the statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he decision of the [ICJ] has <em>no binding force</em> except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1062 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The dissent does not explain how Medell\xc3\xadn, an individual, can be a party to the ICJ proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn argues that because the <em>Avena</em> case involves him, it is clear that he\xe2\x80\x94and the 50 other Mexican nationals named in the <em>Avena </em>decision\xe2\x80\x94should be regarded as parties to the <em>Avena </em>judgment.  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  But cases before the ICJ are often precipitated by disputes involving particular persons or entities, disputes that a nation elects to take up as its own.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light &amp; Power Co. </em>(<em>Belg.</em> v. <em>Spain</em>), 1970 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 3 (Judgment of Feb. 5) (claim brought by Belgium on behalf of Belgian nationals and shareholders); <em>Case Concerning the Protection of French Nationals and Protected Persons in Egypt</em> (<em>Fr.</em> v. <em>Egypt</em>), 1950 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 59 (Order of Mar. 29) (claim brought by France on behalf of French nationals and protected persons in Egypt); <em>Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.

That has never been understood to alter the express and established rules that only nation-states may be parties before the ICJ, Art. 34, 59 Stat. 1059, and\xe2\x80\x94contrary to the position of the dissent, <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 23\xe2\x80\x94that ICJ judgments are binding only between those parties, Art. 59, <em>id.,</em> at 1062.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is, moreover, well settled that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of a treaty \xe2\x80\x9cis entitled to great weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Avagliano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/index.html">457 U.

The Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.

Given our obligation to interpret treaty provisions to determine whether they are self-executing, we have to confess that we do think it rather important to look to the treaty language to see what it has to say about the issue.  That is after all what the Senate looks to in deciding whether to approve the treaty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interpretive approach employed by the Court today\xe2\x80\x94resorting to the text\xe2\x80\x94is hardly novel.  In two early cases involving an 1819 land-grant treaty between Spain and the United States, Chief Justice Marshall found the language of the treaty dispositive.  In <em>Foster</em>, after distinguishing between self-executing treaties (those \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent to an act of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d) and non-self-executing treaties (those \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature must execute\xe2\x80\x9d), Chief Justice Marshall held that the 1819 treaty was non-self-executing.  2 Pet., at 314.  Four years later, the Supreme Court considered another claim under the same treaty, but concluded that the treaty was self-executing.  See <em>Percheman</em>, 7 Pet., at 87.  The reason was not because the treaty was sometimes self-executing and sometimes not, but because \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of\xe2\x80\x9d the Spanish translation (brought to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention for the first time) indicated the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent to ratify and confirm the land-grant \xe2\x80\x9cby force of the instrument itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 89.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As against this time-honored textual approach, the dissent proposes a multifactor, judgment-by-judgment analysis that would \xe2\x80\x9cjettiso[n] relative predictability for the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/527/index.html">513 U. S. 527</a>, 547 (1995).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s novel approach to deciding which (or, more accurately, when) treaties give rise to directly enforceable federal law is arrestingly indeterminate.  Treaty language is barely probative. <em>Post,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he absence or presence of language in a treaty about a provision\xe2\x80\x99s self-execution proves nothing at all\xe2\x80\x9d).  Determining whether treaties themselves create federal law is sometimes committed to the political branches and sometimes to the judiciary.  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  Of those committed to the judiciary, the courts pick and choose which shall be binding United States law\xe2\x80\x94trumping not only state but other federal law as well\xe2\x80\x94and which shall not.  <em>Post,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.  They do this on the basis of a multifactor, \xe2\x80\x9ccontext-specific\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  Even then, the same treaty sometimes gives rise to United States law and sometimes does not, again depending on an ad hoc judicial assessment.  <em>Post,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our Framers established a careful set of procedures that must be followed before federal law can be created under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94vesting that decision in the political branches, subject to checks and balances.  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa77.  They also recognized that treaties could create federal law, but again through the political branches, with the President making the treaty and the Senate approving it.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the treaty route, depending on an ad hoc judgment of the judiciary without looking to the treaty language\xe2\x80\x94the very language negotiated by the President and approved by the Senate\xe2\x80\x94cannot readily be ascribed to those same Framers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach risks the United States\xe2\x80\x99 involvement in international agreements.  It is hard to believe that the United States would enter into treaties that are sometimes enforceable and sometimes not.  Such a treaty would be the equivalent of writing a blank check to the judiciary.  Senators could never be quite sure what the treaties on which they were voting meant.  Only a judge could say for sure and only at some future date.  This uncertainty could hobble the United States\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to negotiate and sign international agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the dissent\xe2\x80\x94for a grab bag of no less than seven reasons\xe2\x80\x94would tell us that this <em>particular</em> ICJ judgment is federal law.  <em>Post</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9327.  That is no sort of guidance.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it any answer to say that the federal courts will diligently police international agreements and enforce the decisions of international tribunals only when they <em>should be</em> enforced.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The point of a non-self-executing treaty is that it \xe2\x80\x9caddresses itself to the political, <em>not</em> the judicial department; and the legislature must execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 314 (emphasis added); <em>Whitney</em>, 124 U. S., at 195.  See also <em>Foster</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 307 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judiciary is not that department of the government, to which the assertion of its interests against foreign powers is confided\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contrary approach would assign to the courts\xe2\x80\x94not the political branches\xe2\x80\x94the primary role in deciding when and how international agreements will be enforced.  To read a treaty so that it sometimes has the effect of domestic law and sometimes does not is tantamount to vesting with the judiciary the power not only to interpret but also to create the law.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that <em>Avena </em>does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the \xe2\x80\x9cpostratification understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of signatory nations.  See <em>Zicherman</em>, 516 U. S., at 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medell\xc3\xadn nor his <em>amici</em> have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In determining that the Vienna Convention did not require certain relief in United States courts in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, we found it pertinent that the requested relief would not be available under the treaty in any other signatory country.  See 548 U. S., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344, and n.\xc2\xa03.  So too here the lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  To begin with, we reiterated in <em>Sanchez</em>-<em>Llamas</em> what we held in <em>Breard</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 351 (quoting <em>Breard</em>, 523 U. S., at 375).  Given that ICJ judgments may interfere with state procedural rules, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated their intent to give those judgments domestic effect, if they had so intended.  Here there is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports the notion that ICJ judgments displace state procedural rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the consequences of Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s argument give pause.  An ICJ judgment, the argument goes, is not only binding domestic law but is also unassailable.  As a result, neither Texas nor this Court may look behind a judgment and quarrel with its reasoning or result.  (We already know, from <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, that this Court disagrees with both the reasoning and result in <em>Avena</em>.)  Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would allow ICJ judgments to override otherwise binding state law; there is nothing in his logic that would exempt contrary federal law from the same fate.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cook </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/288/102/index.html"></a><a href="/us/288/102/index.html">288 U. S. 102</a>, 119 (1933) (later-in-time self-executing treaty supersedes a federal statue if there is a conflict).  And there is nothing to prevent the ICJ from ordering state courts to annul criminal convictions and sentences, for any reason deemed sufficient by the ICJ.  Indeed, that is precisely the relief Mexico requested.  <em>Avena,</em> 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J., at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the dissent flinches at reading the relevant treaties to give rise to self-executing ICJ judgments in all cases.  It admits that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all</em> ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 24.  Our point precisely.  But the lesson to draw from that insight is hardly that the judiciary should decide which judgments are politically sensitive and which are not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, and as we observed in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on our courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 354.  Given that holding, it is difficult to see how that same structure and purpose can establish, as Medell\xc3\xadn argues, that <em>judgments</em> of the ICJ nonetheless were intended to be conclusive on our courts.  A judgment is binding only if there is a rule of law that makes it so.  And the question whether ICJ judgments can bind domestic courts depends upon the same analysis undertaken in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>and set forth above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our prior decisions identified by the dissent as holding a number of treaties to be self-executing, see <em>post,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, Appendix A, stand only for the unremarkable proposition that some international agreements are self-executing and others are not.\xc2\xa0 It is well settled that the \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nterpretation of [a treaty] . . . must, of course, begin with the language of the Treaty itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.,</em> 457 U. S., at 180.  As a result, we have held treaties to be self-executing when the textual provisions indicate that the President and Senate intended for the agreement to have domestic effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn and the dissent cite <em>Comegys</em> v. <em>Vasse</em>, 1 Pet. 193 (1828), for the proposition that the judgments of international tribunals are automatically binding on domestic courts.  See <em>post,</em> at 9; Reply Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  That case, of course, involved a different treaty than the ones at issue here; it stands only for the modest principle that the terms of a treaty control the outcome of a case.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judgments\xe2\x80\x94only that the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter, the Optional Protocol, and the ICJ Statute do not do so.  And whether the treaties underlying a judgment are self-executing so that the judgment is directly enforceable as domestic law in our courts is, of course, a matter for this Court to decide.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 353\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments or international arbitral agreements.  Indeed, we agree with Medell\xc3\xadn that, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9can agreement to abide by the result\xe2\x80\x9d of an international adjudication\xe2\x80\x94or what he really means, an agreement to give the result of such adjudication domestic legal effect\xe2\x80\x94can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  See Brief for Petitioner 20.  The point is that the particular treaty obligations on which Medell\xc3\xadn relies do not of their own force create domestic law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent worries that our decision casts doubt on some 70-odd treaties under which the United States has agreed to submit disputes to the ICJ according to \xe2\x80\x9croughly similar\xe2\x80\x9d provisions.  See <em>post,</em> at 4, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Again, under our established precedent, some treaties are self-executing and some are not, depending on the treaty.  That the judgment of an international tribunal might not automatically become domestic law hardly means the underlying treaty is \xe2\x80\x9cuseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>post</em>, at 17; cf. <em>post</em>, at 11 (describing the British system in which treaties \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually always requir[e] parliamentary legislation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such judgments would still constitute international obligations, the proper subject of political and diplomatic negotiations.  See <em>Head Money Cases</em>, 112 U. S., at 598.  And Congress could elect to give them wholesale effect (rather than the judgment-by-judgment approach hypothesized by the dissent, <em>post</em>, at 24) through implementing legislation, as it regularly has.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105\xe2\x80\x93277, div. G, \xc2\xa72242, 112 Stat. 2681\xe2\x80\x93822, note following 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71231 (directing the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate agencies\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3\xe2\x80\x9d of the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment); see also <em>infra</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (listing examples of legislation implementing international obligations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, that an ICJ judgment may not be automatically enforceable in domestic courts does not mean the particular underlying treaty is not.  Indeed, we have held that a number of the \xe2\x80\x9cFriendship, Commerce, and Navigation\xe2\x80\x9d Treaties cited by the dissent, see <em>post, </em>Appendix B, are self-executing\xe2\x80\x94based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of the[se] Treat[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc., supra</em>, at 180, 189\xe2\x80\x93190.  In <em>Kolovrat</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/187/index.html">366 U. S. 187</a>, 191, 196 (1961), for example, the Court found that Yugoslavian claimants denied inheritance under Oregon law were entitled to inherit personal property pursuant to an 1881 Treaty of Friendship, Navigation, and Commerce between the United States and Serbia.  See also <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/503/index.html">331 U. S. 503</a>, 507\xe2\x80\x93511, 517\xe2\x80\x93518 (1947) (finding that the right to inherit real property granted German aliens under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights with Germany prevailed over California law).  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>post</em>, at 11, neither our approach nor our cases require that a treaty provide for self-execution in so many talismanic words; that is a caricature of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Our cases simply require courts to decide whether a treaty\xe2\x80\x99s terms reflect a determination by the President who negotiated it and the Senate that confirmed it that the treaty has domestic effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Cf. <em>post,</em> at 24 (Breyer,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The judgments of a number of international tribunals enjoy a different status because of implementing legislation enacted by Congress.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71650a(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the [Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes] shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States.

Such language demonstrates that Congress knows how to accord domestic effect to international obligations when it desires such a result.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, Medell\xc3\xadn frames his argument as though giving the <em>Avena</em> judgment binding effect in domestic courts simply conforms to the proposition that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments.  But Medell\xc3\xadn does not ask us to enforce a foreign-court judgment settling a typical commercial or property dispute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>Guyot</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/159/113/index.html">159 U.

Rather, Medell\xc3\xadn argues that the <em>Avena</em> judgment has the effect of enjoining the operation of state law.  What is more, on Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s view, the judgment would force the State to take action to \xe2\x80\x9creview and reconside[r]\xe2\x80\x9d his case.  The general rule, however, is that judgments of foreign courts awarding injunctive relief, even as to private parties, let alone sovereign States, \xe2\x80\x9care not generally entitled to enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 Restatement \xc2\xa7481, Comment <em>b,</em> at 595.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, while the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, it does not of its own force constitute binding federal law that pre-empts state restrictions on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  As we noted in <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, a contrary conclusion would be extraordinary, given that basic rights guaranteed by our own Constitution do not have the effect of displacing state procedural rules.  See 548 U. S., at 360.  Nothing in the text, background, negotiating and drafting history, or practice among signatory nations suggests that the President or Senate intended the improbable result of giving the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by \xe2\x80\x9cmany of our most fundamental constitutional protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Medell\xc3\xadn next argues that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in Avena</em> is binding on state courts by virtue of the President\xe2\x80\x99s February 28, 2005 Memorandum.

First, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 637.  In this circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court can sustain his actions \xe2\x80\x9conly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority \xe2\x80\x9cto establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5.  The Solicitor General first argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the <em>Avena</em> judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d international dispute-resolution power wholly apart from the asserted authority based on the pertinent treaties.  Medell\xc3\xadn adds the additional argument that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his power to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States maintains that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.\xc2\xa0N. Charter.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9.  That is, because the relevant treaties \xe2\x80\x9ccreate an obligation to comply with <em>Avena</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9c<em>implicitly</em> give the President authority to implement that treaty-based obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11 (emphasis added).  As a result, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum is well grounded in the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  The President has an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations, but unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is not among them.  The responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress.  <em>Foster</em>, 2 Pet., at 315; <em>Whitney</em>, 124 U. S., at 194; <em>Igart\xc3\xbaa-De La Rosa</em>, 417 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 150.  As this Court has explained, when treaty stipulations are \xe2\x80\x9cnot self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitney, supra</em>, at 194.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ntil such act shall be passed, the Court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster, supra</em>, at 315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirement that Congress, rather than the President, implement a non-self-executing treaty derives from the text of the Constitution, which divides the treaty-making power between the President and the Senate.  The Constitution vests the President with the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a treaty.  Art. II, \xc2\xa72.  If the Executive determines that a treaty should have domestic effect of its own force, that determination may be implemented \xe2\x80\x9cin mak[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the treaty, by ensuring that it contains language plainly providing for domestic enforceability.  If the treaty is to be self-executing in this respect, the Senate must consent to the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, <em>ibid.,</em> consistent with all other constitutional restraints.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a treaty is ratified without provisions clearly according it domestic effect, however, whether the treaty will ever have such effect is governed by the fundamental constitutional principle that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hamdan </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 548 U. S. 557, 591 (2006) (quoting <em>Ex parte Milligan</em>, 4 Wall. 2, 139 (1866) (opinion of Chase, C.\xc2\xa0J.)); see U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa71 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  As already noted, the terms of a non-self-executing treaty can become domestic law only in the same way as any other law\xe2\x80\x94through passage of legislation by both Houses of Congress, combined with either the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature or a congressional override of a Presidential veto.  See Art. I, \xc2\xa77.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe President\xe2\x80\x99s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U. S., at 587.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the President\xe2\x80\x94acting on his own\xe2\x80\x94to achieve precisely the same result.  We therefore conclude, given the absence of congressional legislation, that the non-self-executing treaties at issue here did not \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ly] or implied[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d vest the President with the unilateral authority to make them self-executing.  See <em>id.,</em> at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Accordingly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the <em>Youngstown</em> framework.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the preceding discussion should make clear that the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so.  When the President asserts the power to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d a non-self-executing treaty by unilaterally creating domestic law, he acts in conflict with the implicit understanding of the ratifying Senate.  His assertion of authority, insofar as it is based on the pertinent non-self-executing treaties, is therefore within Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s third category, not the first or even the second.  See <em>id.,</em> at 637\xe2\x80\x93638.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of the two means described above for giving domestic effect to an international treaty obligation under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94for making law\xe2\x80\x94requires joint action by the Executive and Legislative Branches: The Senate can ratify a self-executing treaty \xe2\x80\x9cma[de]\xe2\x80\x9d by the Executive, or, if the ratified treaty is not self-executing, Congress can enact implementing legislation approved by the President.  It should not be surprising that our Constitution does not contemplate vesting such power in the Executive alone.<font b="1">  As Madison explained in The Federalist No. 47, under our constitutional system of checks and balances, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Cooke ed., p. 326 (1961).  That would, however, seem an apt description of the asserted executive authority unilaterally to give the effect of domestic law to obligations under a non-self-executing treaty.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States nonetheless maintains that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum should be given effect as domestic law because \xe2\x80\x9cthis case involves a valid Presidential action in the context of Congressional \xe2\x80\x98acquiescence\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11, n. 2.  Under the <em>Youngstown </em>tripartite<em> </em>framework, congressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President\xe2\x80\x99s action falls within the second category\xe2\x80\x94that is, when he \xe2\x80\x9cacts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  343 U. S., at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Here, however, as we have explained, the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to accord domestic effect to the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not meet that prerequisite.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, even if we were persuaded that congressional acquiescence could support the President\xe2\x80\x99s asserted authority to create domestic law pursuant to a non-self-executing treaty, such acquiescence does not exist here.  The United States first locates congressional acquiescence in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act following the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of prior ICJ controversies.  A review of the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s actions in those prior cases, however, cannot support the claim that Congress acquiesced in this particular exercise of Presidential authority, for none of them remotely involved transforming an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displacing state law.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States also directs us to the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d statutory responsibilities and to his \xe2\x80\x9cestablished role\xe2\x80\x9d in litigating foreign policy concerns as support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s asserted authority to give the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Avena </em>the force of domestic law.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9319.  Congress has indeed authorized the President to represent the United States before the United Nations, the ICJ, and the Security Council, 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7287, but the authority of the President to represent the United States before such bodies speaks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s <em>international</em> responsibilities, not any unilateral authority to create domestic law.  The authority expressly conferred by Congress in the international realm cannot be said to \xe2\x80\x9cinvite\xe2\x80\x9d the Presidential action at issue here.  See <em>Youngstown, supra</em>, at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  At bottom, none of the sources of authority identified by the United States supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Congress has acquiesced in his asserted power to establish on his own federal law or to override state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of this is to say, however, that the combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation precludes the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation.  It is only to say that the Executive cannot unilaterally execute a non-self-executing treaty by giving it domestic effect.  That is, the non-self-executing character of a treaty constrains the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to comply with treaty commitments by unilaterally making the treaty binding on domestic courts.  The President may comply with the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s obligations by some other means, so long as they are consistent with the Constitution.  But he may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus turn to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 claim that\xe2\x80\x94independent of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations\xe2\x80\x94the Memorandum is a valid exercise of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes with foreign nations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316.

In these cases this Court has explained that, if pervasive enough, a history of congressional acquiescence can be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9cgloss on \xe2\x80\x98Executive Power\xe2\x80\x99 vested in the President by \xc2\xa71 of Art.\xc2\xa0II.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 686 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is of a different nature than the one rejected above.  Rather than relying on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations, the President relies on an independent source of authority in ordering Texas to put aside its procedural bar to successive habeas petitions.  Nevertheless, we find that our claims-settlement cases do not support the authority that the President asserts in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Belmont, supra</em>, at 327.  They are based on the view that \xe2\x80\x9ca systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned,\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9craise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dames &amp; Moore, supra</em>, at 686 (some internal quotation marks omitted).

Indeed, the Government has not identified a single instance in which the President has attempted (or Congress has acquiesced in) a Presidential directive issued to state courts, much less one that reaches deep into the heart of the State\xe2\x80\x99s police powers and compels state courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws.

See Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in <em>Ex parte Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, No. 675430\xe2\x80\x93A (Tex. Crim. App.), pp. 25\xe2\x80\x9331.  In light of our disposition of this case, we need not consider whether Medell\xc3\xadn was prejudiced in any way by the violation of his Vienna Convention rights.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The label \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d has on occasion been used to convey different meanings.  What we mean by \xe2\x80\x9cself-executing\xe2\x80\x9d is that the treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification.  Conversely, a \xe2\x80\x9cnon-self-executing\xe2\x80\x9d treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law.  Whether such a treaty has domestic effect depends upon implementing legislation passed by Congress.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even when treaties are self-executing in the sense that they create federal law, the background presumption is that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nternational agreements, even those directly benefiting private persons, generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7907, Comment <em>a, </em>p. 395 (1986) (hereinafter Restatement).

It is not clear whether that principle would apply when the question is the binding force of ICJ judgments themselves, rather than the substantive scope of a treaty the ICJ must interpret in resolving disputes.

Even the ICJ experts do not cite a case so holding, and Moroccan practice is at best inconsistent, for at least one local Moroccan court has held that ICJ judgments are not binding as a matter of municipal law.

We agree.  The questions here are the far more limited ones of whether he may unilaterally create federal law by giving effect to the judgment of this international tribunal pursuant to this non-self-executing treaty, and, if not, whether he may rely on other authority under the Constitution to support the action taken in this particular case.  Those are the only questions we decide.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Rather, in the <em>Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua</em> (<em>Nicar.</em> v. <em>U.

In response, the State Department sent letters to the States \xe2\x80\x9cencouraging\xe2\x80\x9d them to consider the Vienna Convention in the clemency process.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Such encouragement did not give the ICJ judgment direct effect as domestic law; thus, it cannot serve as precedent for doing so in which Congress might be said to have acquiesced.  In the <em>Case Concerning the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations </em>(<em>Para.</em> v. <em>U.

I agree that the text and history of the Supremacy Clause, as well as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s treaty-related cases, do not support a presumption against self-execution.  See <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310. <em> </em>I also endorse the proposition that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820, \xe2\x80\x9cis itself self-executing and judicially enforceable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 19.  Moreover, I think this case presents a closer question than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion allows.  In the end, however, I am persuaded that the relevant treaties do not authorize this Court to enforce the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals </em>(<em>Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.</em>), 2004 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (<em>Avena</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The source of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to comply with judgments of the ICJ is found in Article 94(1) of the United Nations Charter, which was ratified in 1945.  Article 94(1) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach Member of the United Nations <em>undertakes to comply</em> with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  59 Stat. 1051, T.\xc2\xa0S. No. 993 (emphasis added).  In my view, the words \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94while not the model of either a self-executing or a non-self-executing commitment\xe2\x80\x94are most naturally read as a promise to take additional steps to enforce ICJ judgments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the text of some other treaties, the terms of the United Nations Charter do not necessarily incorporate international judgments into domestic law.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Annex VI, Art. 39, Dec. 10, 1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103\xe2\x80\x9339, 1833 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 570 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ecisions of the [Seabed Disputes] Chamber shall be enforceable in the territories of the States Parties in the same manner as judgments or orders of the highest court of the State Party in whose territory the enforcement is sought\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, Congress has passed implementing legislation to ensure the enforcement of other international judgments, even when the operative treaty provisions use far more mandatory language than \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand Article 94(1) does not contain the kind of unambiguous language foreclosing self-execution that is found in other treaties.  The obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ decisions is more consistent with self-execution than, for example, an obligation to enact legislation.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> International Plant Protection Convention, Art. I, Dec. 6, 1951, [1972] 23 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 2770, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 7465 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he contracting Governments undertake to adopt the legislative, technical and administrative measures specified in this Convention\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, whereas the Senate has issued declarations of non-self-execution when ratifying some treaties, it did not do so with respect to the United Nations Charter.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent a presumption one way or the other, the best reading of the words \xe2\x80\x9cundertakes to comply\xe2\x80\x9d is, in my judgment, one that contemplates future action by the political branches.  I agree with the dissenters that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 24.  But this concern counsels in favor of reading any ambiguity in Article 94(1) as leaving the choice of whether to comply with ICJ judgments, and in what manner, \xe2\x80\x9cto the political, not the judicial department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Neilson</em>, 2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The additional treaty provisions cited by the dissent do not suggest otherwise.  In an annex to the United Nations Charter, the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute) states that a decision of the ICJ \xe2\x80\x9chas no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.  Because I read that provision as confining, not expanding, the effect of ICJ judgments, it does not make the undertaking to comply with such judgments any more enforceable than the terms of Article 94(1) itself.  That the judgment is \xe2\x80\x9cbinding\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of international law says nothing about its domestic legal effect.  Nor in my opinion does the reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention, Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0T. 325, T.\xc2\xa0I.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0S. No. 6820, shed any light on the matter.  This provision merely secures the consent of signatory nations to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention.  See ICJ Statute, Art. 36(1), 59 Stat. 1060 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe jurisdiction of the Court comprises . . . all matters specially provided for . . . in treaties and conventions in force\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Avena</em> is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Law of the Land,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl. 2, no one disputes that it constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the United States.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  By issuing a memorandum declaring that state courts should give effect to the judgment in <em>Avena</em>,<em> </em>the President made a commendable attempt to induce the States to discharge the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s obligation.  I agree with the Texas judges and the majority of this Court that the President\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum is not binding law.  Nonetheless, the fact that the President cannot legislate unilaterally does not absolve the United States from its promise to take action necessary to comply with the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the express terms of the Supremacy Clause, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to \xe2\x80\x9cundertak[e] to comply\xe2\x80\x9d with the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision falls on each of the States as well as the Federal Government.  One consequence of our form of government is that sometimes States must shoulder the primary responsibility for protecting the honor and integrity of the Nation.  Texas\xe2\x80\x99 duty in this respect is all the greater since it was Texas that\xe2\x80\x94by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the Vienna Convention\xe2\x80\x94ensnared the United States in the current controversy.  Having already put the Nation in breach of one treaty, it is now up to Texas to prevent the breach of another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision in <em>Avena</em> merely obligates the United States \xe2\x80\x9cto provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals,\xe2\x80\x9d 2004 I.

S. ___ (2008), we concluded that neither the President nor the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has the authority to require Texas to determine whether its violation of the Vienna Convention prejudiced petitioner. Although I agreed with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, I wrote separately to make clear my view that Texas retained the authority\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, the duty as a matter of international law\xe2\x80\x94to remedy the potentially significant breach of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 treaty obligations identified in the President\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum to the Attorney General.  Because it appears that Texas has not taken action to address the serious national security and foreign policy implications of this suit, I believe we should request the views of the Solicitor General, who argued on behalf of the Executive Branch in earlier proceedings in the suit, before allowing Texas to proceed with the execution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I explained in my separate opinion in March, the cost to Texas of complying with the ICJ judgment \xe2\x80\x9cwould be minimal, particularly given the remote likelihood that the violation of the Vienna Convention actually prejudiced\xe2\x80\x9d this petitioner.  552 U.

The entire Court and the President agree that breach will jeopardize the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98plainly compelling\xe2\x80\x99 interests in \xe2\x80\x98ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.  </em>Given these stakes, and given that petitioner has been under a death sentence for 14 years, waiting a short time to guarantee that the views of the Executive have been given respectful consideration is only prudent.

The United States has agreed that the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s judgments will have \xe2\x80\x9cbinding force . . . between the parties and in respect of [a] particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  United Nations Charter, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945).  The President of the United States has concluded that domestic courts should enforce this particular ICJ judgment.  Memorandum to the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x93984, p. 187a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Medell\xc3\xadn </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (six to three vote), this Court, while recognizing that the United States was bound by treaty to follow the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s determination as a matter of <em>international</em> law, held that that determination did not <em>automatically</em> bind the courts of the United States as a matter of <em>domestic law </em>in the absence of further congressional legislation.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.  In reaching this conclusion the majority, as well as the dissent, recognized that, without the further hearing that the ICJ found necessary, the execution would violate our international treaty commitments. See <em>id.</em>, at  ___.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, who is scheduled to be executed this evening, now asks us to delay the execution in order to give Congress an opportunity to act to cure the legal defect that the Court found in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn.  </em>In my view, several factors counsel in favor of delay.<em>  First, s</em>ince this Court handed down <em>Medell\xc3\xadn,</em> Mexico has returned to the ICJ requesting this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with its international obligations; and the ICJ has asked that the United States \xe2\x80\x9ctake all measures necessary to ensure that [the Mexican nationals] are not executed\xe2\x80\x9d unless and until they \xe2\x80\x9creceive review and reconsideration consistent\xe2\x80\x9d with the ICJ\xe2\x80\x99s earlier <em>Avena</em> decision.  See <em>Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v.<em> U. S.)</em>, 2008 I.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0J. No. 139, \xc2\xb680 (Order of July 16).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second, </em>legislation has been introduced in Congress seeking to provide the legislative approval necessary to transform our international legal obligations into binding domestic law.  See Avena Case Implementation Act of 2008, H.\xc2\xa0R. 6481, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (referred to committee, July 14, 2008).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third, </em>prior to <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em>, Congress may not have understood the legal need for further legislation of this kind.  That fact, along with the approaching election, means that more than a few days or weeks are likely necessary for Congress to determine whether to enact the proposed legislation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth, </em>to permit this execution to proceed forthwith places the United States irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth</em>, the President of the United States has emphasized the importance of carrying out our treaty-based obligations in this case; this fact, along with the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for foreign affairs, makes the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s views of the matter pertinent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sixth, </em>different Members of this Court seem to have very different views of what this case is about.  In my view, the issue in this suit\xe2\x80\x94what the majority describe as the \xe2\x80\x9cbeginning premise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is not whether a confession was unlawfully obtained from petitioner. Cf. <em>ante,</em> at    . Rather, the question before us is whether the United States will carry out its international legal obligation to enforce the decision of the ICJ.  That decision requires a further hearing to determine whether a conceded violation of the Vienna Convention (Texas\xe2\x80\x99 failure to inform petitioner of his rights under the Vienna Convention) was or was not harmless.  Nor do I believe the majority is correct insofar as it implies that Congress has had <em>four years to consider the matter.  </em>See <em>ibid. </em>(<em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em>Congress has not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our ruling in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn</em> v. <em>Texas</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the contrary, until this Court\'s decision in <em>Medell\xc3\xadn </em>a few months ago<em>, </em>a member of Congress might reasonably have believed there was no need for legislation because the relevant treaty provisions were self-executing.   It is not realistic to believe Congress could act to provide the necessary legislative approval in only a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, we should seek the views of the Solicitor General (which may well clarify these matters), and we should grant a stay of sufficient length for careful consideration of those views, along with the other briefs and materials filed in this suit.  A sufficient number of Justices having voted to secure those views (four), it is particularly disappointing that no Member of the majority has proved willing to provide a courtesy vote for a stay so that we can consider the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s view once received.  As it is, the request will be mooted by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s execution, which execution, as I have said, will place this Nation in violation of international law. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962720">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n554 U.

A bill on the subject has been introduced in the Congress, Avena Case Implementation Act of 2008, H.\xc2\xa0R. 6481, 110th Cong., 2d Sess.
