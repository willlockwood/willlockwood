Whether independent acts of alleged conspirators, after the accomplishment of the object of the conspiracy and done without the knowledge or the participation of the petitioner Grunewald, may suffice to support a charge against him that the original conspiracy included a continuing purpose to conceal so that the conspiracy might be deemed to extend down to the last act of concealment.</ul> <ul>\'3.

Under the circumstances surrounding a defendant\'s appearance before a Grand Jury as set forth in the last preceding paragraph, does not the Court\'s instruction as aforesaid illegally impeach and impede the defendant\'s statutory right to be a witness on his own behalf?</ul> <ul>\'4. Does the rationale of Raffel v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/271/494/case.html">271 U.S. 494</a> [46 S. Ct. 566], apply to prior invocation of the Fifth Amendment before a Grand Jury as distinguished from such action at a prior trial?</ul> <ul>\'5. Does not the doctrine and rationale of Slochower v.

Is not a defendant, particularly one who asserted that he was invoking the Fifth Amendment as an innocent man being plotted against and beset by suspicious circumstances entitled to have the jury charged, \'An innocent man may honestly claim his answers may tend to incriminate him\'?</ul> <ul>\'8. Does not the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the statute of limitations against conspiracy was not tolled, in that certain overt acts of concealment when committed were chargeable to the original conspiracy disregard and deny effect to this Court\'s views on proof of subsidiary concealment conspiracies, as set forth in Krulewitch v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/440/case.html">336 U.S. 440</a> [] and Lutwak v.

Whether the three year Statute of Limitations, applicable to the charge of conspiracy, barred conviction of the petitioner Bolich inasmuch as the objective of the alleged conspiracy had been achieved by January, 1949-more than five years before the date of the indictment which was filed on October 25, 1954.</ul> <ul>\'2. Whether multiple conspiracies were established by the evidence, rather than a single general conspiracy, to the substantial prejudice of the rights of the petitioner Bolich.</ul> <ul>\'6. Whether the trial Court committed prejudicial error in permitting the government to elicit from the defendant Halperin upon his cross- examination that he had invoked the Fifth Amendment at a Grand Jury hearing and the trial Court charged the jury that they might consider Halperin\'s claim of constitutional privilege as adversely affecting his credibility.\'</ul> <p> A total of two hours will be allowed for argument on these questions. <b></b></p><p><b> (b)</b> No. 184: </p><ul>\'7. Does it constitute due process to subpoena a person to testify before a Grand Jury in an investigation of which he is a primary target, and thereby permit an examination before trial of a de facto defendant?</ul> <ul>\'11. Does a lawyer who advises a witness to plead the Fifth Amendment where the witness is justified in doing so become guilty of corruptly endeavoring to influence the witness merely because the interposition of the Constitutional privilege might also serve to protect the person giving the advice?\' <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="870">Page 352 U.S. 866 , 870</a></p><p> A total of one hour will be allowed for argument on these questions.</p></ul> <p> Messrs.
