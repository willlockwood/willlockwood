The 1974 collective bargaining agreement between the United Mine Workers of America and the Bituminous Coal Operators\' Association, Inc., increased the health benefits for widows in the former class, but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 455 U. S. 564</a></p><p> made no increase for those in the latter class.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that this discrimination was arbitrary, and therefore violated \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  205 U.S.App.D.C. 330, 640 F.2d 416 (1981).  We granted certiorari to decide whether \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5) authorizes federal courts to review for reasonableness the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement allocating health benefits among potential beneficiaries of an employee benefit trust fund.  454 U.S. 814.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A description of the origin of the discrimination may explain why the Court of Appeals considered it arbitrary.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 455 U. S. 565</a></p><p> 1950 collective bargaining agreement between the union and the operators established a fund to provide pension, health, and other benefits for certain miners and their dependents.  That agreement defined the operators\' obligation to contribute to the fund, but delegated the authority to define the amount of benefits and the conditions of eligibility to the trustees of the fund. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In 1967, the trustees adopted two resolutions governing benefits for widows.  Under the first, a widow of a retired miner who was receiving a pension at the time of his death was entitled to a death benefit of $2,000 payable over a 2-year period, and a widow of a miner who was eligible for a pension but who was still working at the time of his death was entitled to a $5,000 benefit payable over a 5-year period. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The second resolution authorized hospital and medical care benefits for unremarried widows of deceased miners while they were receiving the widows\' benefit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 455 U. S. 566</a></p><p> authorized by the first resolution. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The effect of these two resolutions was to provide a greater health benefit for widows of working miners who were eligible for pensions than for widows of miners who were receiving pension benefits.</p>\n<p>In 1974, because of their concerns about compliance with minimum funding standards of the recently enacted Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1001 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. IV), and about the actuarial soundness of the 1950 fund, the union and the operators agreed to restructure the industry\'s benefit program.  They agreed that the amount of benefits and the eligibility requirements, as well as the level of contributions, should be specified in their collective bargaining agreement.  They also decided to replace the single 1950 fund with four separate funds, two of which provided pension benefits while two others, the "1950 Benefit Trust" and the "1974 Benefit Trust," provided health and death benefits.  The 1950 Benefit Trust, which is at issue in this case, extended lifetime health coverage to certain widows of miners who died before December 6, 1974, the effective date of the 1974 collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 455 U. S. 567</a></p><p></p>\n<p>During the 1974 negotiations, the union originally demanded that all unremarried widows who were entitled to health benefits for either two years or five years under the old plan be extended lifetime health coverage.  Both the amount and the uncertainty of the cost of such coverage for these widows concerned the operators.  Relatively early in the negotiations, they nevertheless accepted the demand as it related to widows of miners who would die after the agreement became effective, but they objected to the requested increase for widows of already deceased miners.  The operators estimated that the latter class consisted of between 25,000 and 50,000 widows, whereas the union\'s estimate was approximately 40,000.  Of that total, about 10% were believed to be widows of miners who had been working at the time of their death, even though eligible for pensions, and thus already had been entitled to five years of health benefits.  In the final stages of the 1974 negotiations, after a strike had begun, the operators made a package proposal to the union that excluded this smaller group of perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 widows from any increased health benefits.  Besides making it possible to conclude an otherwise acceptable, complex collective bargaining agreement and to avoid a prolonged strike, the union received no separately identifiable <em>quid pro quo</em> for the rejection of this portion of its demands.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents are widows of coal miners who died in 1967 and 1971, respectively.  Their husbands were over age 55, had been employed in the industry for over 20 years, and had spent most of their careers in the employ of contributing employers.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 455 U. S. 568</a></p><p> They were eligible for pensions, but were still working at the time of their deaths.  Under the 1950 plan, respondents were entitled to $5,000 death benefits and health benefits for five years.  They received no additional benefits from the 1974 agreement.  Had their husbands applied for the pensions for which they were eligible, they now would be entitled to lifetime health coverage.</p>\n<p>On their own behalf and as representatives of a class of similarly situated widows and dependents of deceased coal miners, respondents brought this action against the trustees of the funds in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  They alleged that the requirement that a miner actually be receiving a pension for which he was eligible at the time of his death in order to make his survivors eligible for lifetime health benefits has no rational relationship with the purposes of the trust funds, and therefore was illegal under \xc2\xa7 302 of the LMRA.  They prayed that the requirement be declared null and void, and that the trustees be ordered to pay to them health benefits retrospectively and prospectively.</p>\n<p>After certifying the respondents\' class, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and after indicating that the plaintiffs had made a <em>prima facie</em> showing of arbitrariness, the court scheduled a hearing to give the petitioners an opportunity to prove that the discrimination against respondents was not arbitrary.  At that hearing the District Court received documents prepared during the 1974 collective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 455 U. S. 569</a></p><p> bargaining negotiations and heard the testimony of participants in those negotiations.  Based on that evidence, the District Court found that</p>\n<p>"the question of whether or not to provide plaintiffs the benefits they now seek was the subject of explicit, informed and intense bargaining."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a.  The court rejected the argument that the eligibility requirement was arbitrary and capricious, and held that "the trustees are bound to adhere to the terms of the agreement."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court concluded:</p>\n<p>"Public policy dictates the limited role of courts in reviewing collectively bargained agreements.  The familiar history of the anguished relations between the bargaining parties in this case only underscores the delicacy of the balance set in each agreement.  Plaintiffs\' relief, if indeed any is due, cannot come from the courts."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed.  Relying on the \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5) requirement that jointly administered pension trusts be maintained "for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of [the contributing] employer, and their families and dependents," the court held that any rule denying benefits to employees on whose behalf significant contributions had been made must be explained to its satisfaction, particularly if benefits were authorized for others who had worked a lesser period of time for contributing employers.  205 U.S.App.D.C. at 335, 640 F.2d at 421.  In this case, the trustees were unable to produce an acceptable explanation for the discrimination between widows of pensioners and widows of pension-eligible miners.  Specifically, the court held that it was "not enough that the particular eligibility standards were adopted simply because that enabled resolution of a collective bargaining dispute."  <em>Id.</em> at 338, 640 F.2d at 424.  Recognizing the legitimacy of a concern about actuarial soundness of pension trust funds, the court held that</p>\n<p>"financial integrity must be secured by methods dividing beneficiaries from nonbeneficiaries on lines reasonably </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 455 U. S. 570</a></p><p> calculated to further the fund\'s purposes."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 337-338, 640 F.2d at 423-424.</p>\n<p>Judge Robb, in dissent, agreed with the reasoning of the District Court and added the observation that the discrimination against widows of active miners was rational because those widows had received a larger death benefit than widows of pensioners, and because their needs may have been lesser than those of the families of pensioners, since their husbands had continued to work after they were eligible for pensions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that the requirement in \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5) that an employee benefit trust fund be maintained "for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees . . . and their families and dependents" means that eligibility rules fixed by a collective bargaining agreement must meet a reasonableness standard.  The statutory language hardly embodies this reasonableness requirement.  Its plain meaning is simply that employer contributions to employee benefit trust funds must accrue to the benefit of employees and their families and dependents, to the exclusion of all others.  Indeed, this has been this Court\'s consistent interpretation of \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5).</p>\n<p>Just last Term, the Court reiterated that</p>\n<p>"the \'sole purpose\' of \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5) is to ensure that employee benefit trust funds \'are legitimate trust funds, used actually for the specified benefits to the employees of the employers who contribute to them. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>NLRB v.

This reading is amply supported by the legislative history.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 93 Cong.Rec. 4877 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. LMRA, at 1312; [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] 93 Cong.Rec. at 4752-4753, 2 Leg.Hist. LMRA, at 1321-1322. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The section was meant to protect employees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 455 U. S. 572</a></p><p> from the risk that funds contributed by their employers for the benefit of the employees and their families might be diverted to other union purposes or even to the private benefit of faithless union leaders.  Proponents of this section were concerned that pension funds administered entirely by union leadership might serve as "war chests" to support union programs or political factions, or might become vehicles through which "racketeers" accepted bribes or extorted money from employers.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the purpose of the "sole and exclusive benefit" requirement is reinforced by the other requirements of \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5).  Section 302(c)(5) is an exception in a criminal statute that broadly prohibits employers from making direct or indirect payments to unions or union officials.  Each of the specific conditions that must be satisfied to exempt employer contributions to pension funds from the criminal sanction is consistent with the nondiversion purpose.  The fund must be established "for the sole and exclusive benefit" of employees and their families and dependents; contributions must be held in trust for that purpose, and must be used exclusively for health, retirement, death, disability, or unemployment benefits; the basis for paying benefits must be specified in a written agreement; and the fund must be jointly administered by representatives of management and labor. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  All the conditions in the section fortify the basic requirement that employer contributions be administered for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees.  None of the conditions places any restriction on the allocation of the funds among the persons protected by \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 455 U. S. 573</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals did not attempt to ground its holding on the text or legislative history of \xc2\xa7 302(c)(5).  Rather, the court relied upon cases in which trustees of employee benefit trust funds, not the collective bargaining agreement, fixed the eligibility rules and benefit levels.  The Court of Appeals has held in those cases</p>\n<p>"that the Trustees have \'full authority . . . with respect to questions of coverage and eligibility,\' and that the court\'s role is limited to ascertaining whether the Trustees\' broad discretion has been abused by the adoption of arbitrary or capricious standards."</p>\n<p><em>Pete v. United Mine Workers of America Welfare &amp; Retirement Fund of 1950,</em> 171 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 9, 517 F.2d 1275, 1283 (1975) (en banc) (footnote omitted).  Noting that</p>\n<p>"[t]he institutional arrangements creating this Fund and specifying the purposes to which it is to be devoted are cast expressly in fiduciary form,"</p>\n<p>the court stated that</p>\n<p>"the Trustees, like all fiduciaries, are subject to judicial correction in a proper case upon a showing that they have acted arbitrarily or capriciously towards one of the persons to whom their trust obligations run."</p>\n<p><em>Kosty v. Lewis,</em> 115 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 346, 319 F.2d 744, 747 (1963), <em>cert. denied,</em> 375 U.S. 964.  Those cases, however, provide no support for the Court of Appeals\' holding in this case. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The petitioner trustees were not given "full authority" to determine eligibility requirements and benefit levels, for these were fixed by the 1974 collective bargaining agreement.  By the terms of the trust created by that agreement, the trustees are obligated to enforce these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 455 U. S. 574</a></p><p> determinations unless modification is required to comply with applicable federal law. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The common law of trusts does not alter this obligation.  <em>See NLRB v. Amax Coal Co.,</em> 453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/322/case.html#336">453 U.

Absent conflict with federal law, then, the trustees breached no fiduciary duties in administering the 1950 Benefit Trust in accordance with the terms established in the 1974 collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Section 302(c)(5) plainly does not impose the Court of Appeals\' reasonableness requirement, and respondents do not offer any alternative federal law to sustain the court\'s holding.  There is no general requirement that the complex schedule of the various employee benefits must withstand judicial review under an undefined standard of reasonableness.  This is no less true when the potential beneficiaries subject to discriminatory treatment are not members of the bargaining unit; we previously have recognized that former members and their families may suffer from discrimination in collective bargaining agreements because the union need not</p>\n<p>"affirmatively . . . represent [them] or . . . take into account their interests in making bona fide economic decisions in behalf </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 455 U.
