Easton,</a></span></em> 1 Wheat. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 27 U.

The sale and conveyance, however, by which this connection is to be formed are admitted to be void.  The conveyance, being made by a person having no authority to make it, is of no validity and cannot connect the purchaser with the original grant.  We are therefore of opinion that the law is for the plaintiff, and that this be certified as the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p>This cause came on the be heard on a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of west Tennessee, and on the questions and points on which the said judges of that court were divided in opinion and which have been certified to this Court and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof this Court is of opinion that under the statute of limitations of Tennessee of 1797, a possession of seven years is a protection only when held under a grant or under valid mesne conveyances or a paper title which are legally or equitably connected with a grant, and that a void deed is not such a conveyance as that a possession under it will be protected under the statute of limitations, all which is directed and ordered to be certified to the said Circuit Court of the United States for the Seventh Circuit and District of West Tennessee.</p>\n<p>(2 Pet.)</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
