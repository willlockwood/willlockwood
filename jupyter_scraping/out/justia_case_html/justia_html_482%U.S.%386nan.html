Subsequently, they were downgraded to unionized positions, but allegedly assured that the downgrades were temporary.  However, Caterpillar later notified them that its San Leandro plant would close and that they would be laid off.  Respondents then filed this action, based solely on state law, in a California state court, alleging that Caterpillar thereby breached their individual employment contracts.  Caterpillar removed the action to Federal District Court, arguing that removal was proper because any individual employment contracts made with respondents were, as a matter of federal substantive labor law, merged into and superseded by the collective bargaining agreement.  Respondents denied that they alleged any federal claim, and sought remand of the action to the state court.  The Federal District Court held that removal was proper, and dismissed the case when respondents refused to amend the complaint to attempt to state a claim under \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, which confers federal jurisdiction as to suits for violations of collective bargaining agreements.

Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 10-26, App. to Pet. for Cert. (App.) A-40 - A-42.  Initially, each respondent filled a position covered by the collective bargaining agreement between Caterpillar and Local Lodge No. 284, International Association of Machinists (Union).  Each eventually became either a managerial or a weekly salaried employee, positions outside the coverage of the collective bargaining agreement.  Respondents held the latter positions for periods ranging from 3 to 15 years; all but two respondents served 8 years or more.   App. A-97 - A-98.</p>\n<p>Respondents allege that, "[d]uring the course of [their] employment, as management or weekly salaried employees," Caterpillar made oral and written representations that</p>\n<p>"they could look forward to indefinite and lasting employment with the corporation, and that they could count on the corporation to take care of them."</p>\n<p>Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 27A, 27D, App. A-43.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 482 U. S. 389</a></p><p> More specifically, respondents claim that,</p>\n<p>"while serving Caterpillar as managers or weekly salaried employees, [they] were assured that, if the San Leandro facility of Caterpillar ever closed, Caterpillar would provide employment opportunities for [them] at other facilities of Caterpillar, its subsidiaries, divisions, or related companies."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 27F, App. A-48. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents maintain that these "promises were continually and repeatedly made," and that they created "a total employment agreement wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement pertaining to hourly employees."  <em>Id.</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 29, App. A-49. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In reliance on these promises, respondents assert, they "continued to remain in Caterpillar\'s employ rather than seeking other employment."  <em>Id.</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 31, App. A-49.</p>\n<p>Between May, 1980, and January, 1984, Caterpillar downgraded respondents from managerial and weekly salaried positions to hourly positions covered by the collective bargaining agreement.  Respondents allege that, at the time they were downgraded to unionized positions, Caterpillar supervisors orally assured them that the downgrades were temporary.  <em>Id.</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 27F, App. A-48.  On December 15, 1983, Caterpillar notified respondents that its San Leandro plant would close and that they would be laid off. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 482 U. S. 390</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On December 17, 1984, respondents filed an action based solely on state law in California state court, contending that Caterpillar</p>\n<p>"breached [its] employment agreement by notifying [respondents] that the San Leandro plant would be closed and subsequently advising [respondents] that they would be terminated"</p>\n<p>without regard to the individual employment contracts.  <em>Id.</em> \xef\xbf\xbd 32, App. A-49. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Caterpillar then removed the action to federal court, arguing that removal was proper because any individual employment contracts made with respondents "were, as a matter of federal substantive labor law, merged into and superseded by the . . . collective bargaining agreements."  Petition for Removal, App. A-36.  Respondents denied that they alleged any federal claim, and immediately sought remand of the action to the state court.  In an oral opinion, the District Court held that removal to federal court was proper, and dismissed the case when respondents refused to amend their complaint to attempt to state a claim under \xc2\xa7 301 of the LMRA.   App. A-4.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the case was improperly removed.  786 F.2d 928 (1986).  The court determined that respondents\' state law claims were not grounded, either directly or indirectly, upon rights or liabilities created by the collective bargaining agreement.  Caterpillar\'s claim that its collective bargaining agreement with the Union superseded and extinguished all previous individual employment contracts alleged by respondents was deemed irrelevant.  The court labeled this argument a "defensive allegation," "raised to defeat the [respondents\'] claims grounded in those independent contracts."  <em>Id.</em> at 936.  Since respondents\' cause of action did not require interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 482 U. S. 391</a></p><p> the court concluded that the complaint did not arise under \xc2\xa7 301 and was not removable to federal court.

S. 1</a></span> (1983)), and we sketch only its outline here.</p>\n<p>Only state court actions that originally could have been filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Absent diversity of citizenship, federal question jurisdiction is required. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The presence or absence of federal question jurisdiction is governed by the "well-pleaded complaint rule," which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff\'s properly pleaded complaint.  <em>See Gully v. First National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U.

The rule makes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, federal preemption is raised as a defense to the allegations in a plaintiff\'s complaint.  Before 1887, a federal defense such as preemption could provide a basis for removal, but, in that year, Congress amended the removal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 482 U. S. 393</a></p><p> statute.  We interpret that amendment to authorize removal only where original federal jurisdiction exists.  <em>See</em> Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, 24 Stat. 552, as amended by Act of Aug. 13, 1888, ch. 866, 25 Stat. 433.  Thus, it is now settled law that a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of preemption, even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff\'s complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.  <em>See Franchise Tax Board,</em> 463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#12">463 U.

S. 22</a></span>, known as the "complete preemption" doctrine.  On occasion, the Court has concluded that the preemptive force of a statute is so "extraordinary" that it "converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule."  <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/58/case.html#65">481 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Once an area of state law has been completely preempted, any claim purportedly based on that preempted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law.  <em>See Franchise Tax Board, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/case.html#24">463 U.

In <em>Avco Corp. v.

We disagree.

Section 301 says nothing about the content or validity of individual employment contracts.  It is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 482 U.

As masters of the complaint, however, they chose not to do so.</p>\n<p>Moreover, contrary to Caterpillar\'s assertion, <em>see</em> Reply Brief for Petitioner 10, respondents\' complaint is not substantially dependent upon interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.  It does not rely upon the collective agreement indirectly, nor does it address the relationship between the individual contracts and the collective agreement. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  As the Court has stated,</p>\n<p>"it would be inconsistent with congressional intent under [\xc2\xa7 301] to preempt state rules that proscribe conduct, or establish rights and obligations, independent of a labor contract."</p>\n<p><em>Allis-Chalmers Corp., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/202/case.html#212">471 U.

S. 332</a></span> (1944), arguing that, when respondents returned to the collective bargaining unit, their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 482 U. S. 396</a></p><p> individual employment agreements were subsumed into, or eliminated by, the collective bargaining agreement.  Thus, Caterpillar contends, respondents\' claims under their individual contracts actually <em>are</em> claims under the collective agreement and preempted by \xc2\xa7 301.</p>\n<p>Caterpillar is mistaken.  First, <em>J. I. Case</em> does not stand for the proposition that all individual employment contracts are subsumed into, or eliminated by, the collective bargaining agreement.  In fact, the Court there held:</p>\n<p>"Individual contracts cannot subtract from collective ones, and whether under some circumstances they may add to them in matters covered by the collective bargain we leave to be determined by appropriate forums under the law of contracts applicable, and to the Labor Board if they constitute unfair labor practices."</p>\n<p>321 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/321/case.html#329">321 U. S. 339</a></span>.  Thus, individual employment contracts are not inevitably superseded by any subsequent collective agreement covering an individual employee, and claims based upon them may arise under state law.  Caterpillar\'s basic error is its failure to recognize that a plaintiff covered by a collective bargaining agreement is permitted to assert legal rights <em>independent</em> of that agreement, including state law contract rights, so long as the contract relied upon is not a collective bargaining agreement.  <em>See Allis-Chalmers Corp., supra.</em> [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Caterpillar impermissibly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 482 U. S. 397</a></p><p> attempts to create the prerequisites to removal by ignoring the set of facts (<em>i.e.,</em> the individual employment contracts) presented by respondents, along with their legal characterization of those facts, and arguing that there are different facts respondents might have alleged that would have constituted a federal claim.  In sum, Caterpillar does not seek to point out that the contract relied upon by respondents is, in fact, a collective agreement; rather, it attempts to justify removal on the basis of facts not alleged in the complaint.  The "artful pleading" doctrine cannot be invoked in such circumstances. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, if an employer wishes to dispute the continued legality or viability of a preexisting individual employment contract because an employee has taken a position covered by a collective agreement, it may raise this question in state court.  The employer may argue that the individual employment contract has been preempted due to the principle of exclusive representation in \xc2\xa7 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 159(a).  <em>See Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html">427 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#146">427 U. S. 146</a></span> (1976) (quoting <em>Teamsters v. Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/252/case.html">377 U. S. 252</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/252/case.html#260">377 U. S. 260</a></span> (1964)) (NLRA preempts state law that "<em>upset[s] the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy\'").  Or the employer may contend that enforcement of the individual employment contract arguably would constitute an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, and is therefore preempted.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">San Diego Building</a></span></em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 482 U.

S. 236</a></span> (1959) (state law that infringes upon the National Labor Relations Board\'s primary jurisdiction over unfair labor practice charges is preempted).  The fact that a defendant might ultimately prove that a plaintiff\'s claims are preempted under the NLRA does not establish that they are removable to federal court. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, Caterpillar argues that \xc2\xa7 301 preempts a state law claim even when the employer raises only a defense that requires a court to interpret or apply a collective bargaining agreement.  Caterpillar asserts such a defense claiming that, in its collective bargaining agreement, its unionized employees waived any preexisting individual employment contract rights. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>It is true that, when a defense to a state claim is based on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the state court will have to interpret that agreement to decide whether the state claim survives.  But the presence of a federal question, even a \xc2\xa7 301 question, in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule -- that the plaintiff is the master of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 482 U. S. 399</a></p><p> complaint, that a federal question must appear on the face of the complaint, and that the plaintiff may, by eschewing claims based on federal law, choose to have the cause heard in state court.  When a plaintiff invokes a right created by a collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiff has <em>chosen</em> to plead what we have held must be regarded as a federal claim, and removal is at the defendant\'s option.  But a <em>defendant</em> cannot, merely by injecting a federal question into an action that asserts what is plainly a state law claim, transform the action into one arising under federal law, thereby selecting the forum in which the claim shall be litigated. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  If a defendant could do so, the plaintiff would be master of nothing.  Congress has long since decided that federal defenses do not provide a basis for removal.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/386/case.html#392">482 U.

Petitioners principally rely on the breach-of-contract claim to support removal to federal court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also appears to have held that a case may not be removed to federal court on the ground that it is completely preempted unless the federal cause of action relied upon provides the plaintiff with a remedy.  For example, the court stated:</p>\n<p>"[A] state law cause of action has been \'completely preempted\' when federal law both displaces <em>and</em> supplements the state law -- that, is, when federal law provides both a superseding remedy replacing the state cause of action <em>and</em> preempts that state law cause of action.  These are two distinct inquiries, both of which must be satisfied to permit removal of an action to federal court."</p>\n<p>786 F.2d at 932 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</p>\n<p>This analysis is squarely contradicted by our decision in <em>Avco Corp. v. Machinists,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/557/case.html">390 U. S. 557</a></span> (1968).  We there held that a \xc2\xa7 301 claim was properly removed to federal court although, at the time, the relief sought by the plaintiff could be obtained only in state court.  We reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p>"The nature of the relief available after jurisdiction attaches is, of course, different from the question whether there is jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. . . .  [T]he breadth or narrowness of the relief which may be granted under federal law in \xc2\xa7 301 cases is a distinct question from whether the court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/557/case.html#561">390 U.

Brief for Petitioners 35, n. 24.  But respondents rely on contractual agreements made while they were in managerial or weekly salaried positions -- agreements in which the collective bargaining agreement played no part.  The irrelevance of the collective bargaining agreement to these individual employment contracts is illustrated by the District Court\'s disposition of the claim of Mr. Chambers, who was not in the bargaining unit at the time he was laid off.  His claim was deemed solely a matter of state law (and, by implication, not intertwined with the collective bargaining agreement), and thus was remanded to state court.  <em>See</em> App. A-22.  Moreover, it is unclear whether an examination of the collective bargaining agreement is truly required by California law.  <em>See Youngman v.
