A search incident to that arrest yielded drugs and a gun.  It was then revealed that the warrant had been recalled months earlier, though this information had never been entered into the database.  Herring was indicted on federal gun and drug possession charges and moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that his initial arrest had been illegal.  Assuming that there was a Fourth Amendment violation, the District Court concluded that the exclusionary rule did not apply and denied the motion to suppress.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that the arresting officers were innocent of any wrongdoing, and that Dale County\xe2\x80\x99s failure to update the records was merely negligent.  The court therefore concluded that the benefit of suppression would be marginal or nonexistent and that the evidence was admissible under the good-faith rule of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U.

UNITED STATES<br/>\n555 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 07-513<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">BENNIE DEAN HERRING, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> UNITED\nSTATES</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[January 14, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fourth Amendment forbids \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches and seizures,\xe2\x80\x9d and this usually requires the police to have probable cause or a warrant before making an arrest.  What if an officer reasonably believes there is an outstanding arrest warrant, but that belief turns out to be wrong because of a negligent bookkeeping error by another police employee?  The parties here agree that the ensuing arrest is still a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but dispute whether contraband found during a search incident to that arrest must be excluded in a later prosecution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases establish that such suppression is not an automatic consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.  Instead, the question turns on the culpability of the police and the potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct.  Here the error was the result of isolated negligence attenuated from the arrest.  We hold that in these circumstances the jury should not be barred from considering all the evidence.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 7, 2004, Investigator Mark Anderson learned that Bennie Dean Herring had driven to the Coffee County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department to retrieve something from his impounded truck.  Herring was no stranger to law enforcement, and Anderson asked the county\xe2\x80\x99s warrant clerk, Sandy Pope, to check for any outstanding warrants for Herring\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  When she found none, Anderson asked Pope to check with Sharon Morgan, her counterpart in neighboring Dale County.  After checking Dale County\xe2\x80\x99s computer database, Morgan replied that there was an active arrest warrant for Herring\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appear on a felony charge.  Pope relayed the information to Anderson and asked Morgan to fax over a copy of the warrant as confirmation.  Anderson and a deputy followed Herring as he left the impound lot, pulled him over, and arrested him.  A search incident to the arrest revealed methamphetamine in Herring\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and a pistol (which as a felon he could not possess) in his vehicle.  App. 17\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There had, however, been a mistake about the warrant.  The Dale County sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s computer records are supposed to correspond to actual arrest warrants, which the office also maintains.  But when Morgan went to the files to retrieve the actual warrant to fax to Pope, Morgan was unable to find it.  She called a court clerk and learned that the warrant had been recalled five months earlier.  Normally when a warrant is recalled the court clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office or a judge\xe2\x80\x99s chambers calls Morgan, who enters the information in the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s computer database and disposes of the physical copy.  For whatever reason, the information about the recall of the warrant for Herring did not appear in the database.  Morgan immediately called Pope to alert her to the mixup, and Pope contacted Anderson over a secure radio.  This all unfolded in 10 to 15 minutes, but Herring had already been arrested and found with the gun and drugs, just a few hundred yards from the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office.  <em>Id.,</em> at 26, 35\xe2\x80\x9342, 54\xe2\x80\x9355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Herring was indicted in the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama for illegally possessing the gun and drugs, violations of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) and 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7844(a).  He moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that his initial arrest had been illegal because the warrant had been rescinded.  The Magistrate Judge recommended denying the motion because the arresting officers had acted in a good-faith belief that the warrant was still outstanding.  Thus, even if there were a Fourth Amendment violation, there was \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to believe that application of the exclusionary rule here would deter the occurrence of any future mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 70.  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, 451 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1290 (2005), and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, 492 F.\xc2\xa03d 1212 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit found that the arresting officers in Coffee County \xe2\x80\x9cwere entirely innocent of any wrongdoing or carelessness.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1218.  The court assumed that whoever failed to update the Dale County sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s records was also a law enforcement official, but noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct in question [wa]s a negligent failure to act, not a deliberate or tactical choice to act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the error was merely negligent and attenuated from the arrest, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the benefit of suppressing the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould be marginal or nonexistent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), and the evidence was therefore admissible under the good-faith rule of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html"></a><a href="/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other courts have required exclusion of evidence obtained through similar police errors, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Hoay</em> v. <em>State</em>, 348 Ark. 80, 86\xe2\x80\x9387, 71 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 573, 577 (2002), so we granted Herring\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to resolve the conflict, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  We now affirm the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a probable-cause determination was based on reasonable but mistaken assumptions, the person subjected to a search or seizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitutional violation.  The very phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause\xe2\x80\x9d confirms that the Fourth Amendment does not demand all possible precision.  And whether the error can be traced to a mistake by a state actor or some other source may bear on the analysis.  For purposes of deciding this case, however, we accept the parties\xe2\x80\x99 assumption that there was a Fourth Amendment violation.  The issue is whether the exclusionary rule should be applied.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ccontains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html">514 U. S. 1</a>, 10 (1995).  Nonetheless, our decisions establish an exclusionary rule that, when applicable, forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Weeks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/index.html"></a><a href="/us/232/383/index.html">232 U. S. 383</a>, 398 (1914).  We have stated that this judicially created rule is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Calandra</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/index.html">414 U. S. 338</a>, 348 (1974).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In analyzing the applicability of the rule, <em>Leon</em> admonished that we must consider the actions of all the police officers involved.  468 U. S., at 923, n. 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to consider the objective reasonableness, not only of the officers who eventually executed a warrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who provided information material to the probable-cause determination\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Coffee County officers did nothing improper.  Indeed, the error was noticed so quickly because Coffee County requested a faxed confirmation of the warrant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit concluded, however, that somebody in Dale County should have updated the computer database to reflect the recall of the arrest warrant.  The court also concluded that this error was negligent, but did not find it to be reckless or deliberate.  492 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1218.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  That fact is crucial to our holding that this error is not enough by itself to require \xe2\x80\x9cthe extreme sanction of exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 916.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x82The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that a search or arrest was unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies.  <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Gates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/index.html">462 U. S. 213</a>, 223 (1983).  Indeed, exclusion \xe2\x80\x9chas always been our last resort, not our first impulse,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/586/index.html">547 U. S. 586</a>, 591 (2006), and our precedents establish important principles that constrain application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the exclusionary rule is not an individual right and applies only where it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98result[s] in appreciable deterrence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leon</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 909 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Janis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/index.html">428 U. S. 433</a>, 454 (1976)).  We have repeatedly rejected the argument that exclusion is a necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.  <em>Leon, supra,</em> at 905\xe2\x80\x93906; <em>Evans</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9314; <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole</em> v. <em>Scott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/357/index.html">524 U. S. 357</a>, 363 (1998).   Instead we have focused on the efficacy of the rule in deterring Fourth Amendment violations in the future.  See <em>Calandra</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 347\xe2\x80\x93355; <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/index.html">428 U.

S. 340</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The principal cost of applying the rule is, of course, letting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go free\xe2\x80\x94something that \xe2\x80\x9coffends basic concepts of the criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leon</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 908.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rule\xe2\x80\x99s costly toll upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Havens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/620/index.html">446 U.

S. 727</a>, 734 (1980).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles are reflected in the holding of <em>Leon</em>: When police act under a warrant that is invalid for lack of probable cause, the exclusionary rule does not apply if the police acted \xe2\x80\x9cin objectively reasonable reliance\xe2\x80\x9d on the subsequently invalidated search warrant.  468 U. S.,<em> </em>at 922.  We (perhaps confusingly) called this objectively reasonable reliance \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n. 23.  In a companion case, <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Sheppard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/index.html">468 U. S. 981</a> (1984), we held that the exclusionary rule did not apply when a warrant was invalid because a judge forgot to make \xe2\x80\x9cclerical corrections\xe2\x80\x9d to it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 991.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter we extended these holdings to warrantless administrative searches performed in good-faith reliance on a statute later declared unconstitutional. <em>Krull</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  Finally, in <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html">514 U. S. 1</a>, we applied this good-faith rule to police who reasonably relied on mistaken information in a court\xe2\x80\x99s database that an arrest warrant was outstanding.  We held that a mistake made by a judicial employee could not give rise to exclusion for three reasons: The exclusionary rule was crafted to curb police rather than judicial misconduct; court employees were unlikely to try to subvert the Fourth Amendment; and \xe2\x80\x9cmost important, there [was] no basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule in [those] circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d would have any significant effect in deterring the errors.  <em>Id.,</em> at 15.  <em>Evans</em> left unresolved \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the evidence should be suppressed if police personnel were responsible for the error,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] an issue not argued by the State in that case, <em>id.,</em> at 16, n.\xc2\xa05, but one that we now confront.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xe2\x80\x82The extent to which the exclusionary rule is justified by these deterrence principles varies with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct.  As we said in <em>Leon</em>, \xe2\x80\x9can assessment of the flagrancy of the police misconduct constitutes an important step in the calculus\xe2\x80\x9d of applying the exclusionary rule.  468 U. S., at 911.  Similarly, in <em>Krull</em> we elaborated that \xe2\x80\x9cevidence should be suppressed \xe2\x80\x98only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  480 U. S., at 348\xe2\x80\x93349 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Peltier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/index.html">422 U. S. 531</a>, 542 (1975)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Anticipating the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, Judge Friendly wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he beneficent aim of the exclusionary rule to deter police misconduct can be sufficiently accomplished by a practice . . . outlawing evidence obtained by flagrant or deliberate violation of rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Calif.

See Friendly, <em>supra</em>, at 953, and n. 127 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he situation in <em>Mapp</em>\xe2\x80\x9d featured a \xe2\x80\x9cflagrant or deliberate violation of rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  An error that arises from nonrecurring and attenuated negligence is thus far removed from the core concerns that led us to adopt the rule in the first place.  And in fact since <em>Leon</em>, we have never applied the rule to exclude evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the police conduct was no more intentional or culpable than this.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xe2\x80\x82To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.  As laid out in our cases, the exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct, or in some circumstances recurring or systemic negligence.  The error in this case does not rise to that level.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Franks</em> v. <em>Delaware</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/154/index.html">438 U.

In <em>Franks</em>, we held that police negligence in obtaining a warrant did not even rise to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, let alone meet the more stringent test for triggering the exclusionary rule.  We held that the Constitution allowed defendants, in some circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cto challenge the truthfulness of factual statements made in an affidavit supporting the warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d even after the warrant had issued.  438 U.

If those false statements were necessary to the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination, the warrant would be \xe2\x80\x9cvoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  But we did not find all false statements relevant: \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 171.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both this case and <em>Franks</em> concern false information provided by police.  Under <em>Franks</em>, negligent police miscommunications in the course of acquiring a warrant do not provide a basis to rescind a warrant and render a search or arrest invalid.  Here, the miscommunications occurred in a different context\xe2\x80\x94after the warrant had been issued and recalled\xe2\x80\x94but that fact should not require excluding the evidence obtained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The pertinent analysis of deterrence and culpability is objective, not an \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry into the subjective awareness of arresting officers,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioner 4\xe2\x80\x935.  See also <em>post</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa07 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  We have already held that \xe2\x80\x9cour good-faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal\xe2\x80\x9d in light of \xe2\x80\x9call of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leon</em>, 468 U.

These circumstances frequently include a particular officer\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and experience, but that does not make the test any more subjective than the one for probable cause, which looks to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and experience, <em>Ornelas</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/690/index.html">517 U.

We said as much in <em>Leon</em>, explaining that an officer could not \xe2\x80\x9cobtain a warrant on the basis of a \xe2\x80\x98bare bones\xe2\x80\x99 affidavit and then rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under which the warrant was obtained to conduct the search.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 923, n. 24 (citing <em>Whiteley</em> v. <em>Warden, Wyo.

The exclusionary rule provides redress for Fourth Amendment violations by placing the government in the position it would have been in had there been no unconstitutional arrest and search.

Over 80 years ago, Cardozo, then seated on the New York Court of Appeals, commented critically on the federal exclusionary rule, which had not yet been applied to the States.  He suggested that in at least some cases the rule exacted too high a price from the criminal justice system.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 929, 951 (1965).

I disagree.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The exclusionary rule, the Court suggests, is capable of only marginal deterrence when the misconduct at issue is merely careless, not intentional or reckless.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9, 11.  The suggestion runs counter to a foundational premise of tort law\xe2\x80\x94that liability for negligence, <em>i.e.</em>, lack of due care, creates an incentive to act with greater care.  The Government so acknowledges.  See Brief for United States 21; cf.

S., at 29, n.\xc2\xa05 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the potential impact of a decision applying the exclusionary rule in this case.  As earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 2,<em> </em>the record indicates that there is no electronic connection between the warrant database of the Dale County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department and that of the County Circuit Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office, which is located in the basement of the same building.  App. 39\xe2\x80\x9340, 43, 45.  When a warrant is recalled, one of the \xe2\x80\x9cmany different people that have access to th[e] warrants,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 60, must find the hard copy of the warrant in the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo or three different places\xe2\x80\x9d where the department houses warrants, <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>41, return it to the Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office, and manually update the Department\xe2\x80\x99s database, see <em>id.</em>, at 60.  The record reflects no routine practice of checking the database for accuracy, and the failure to remove the entry for Herring\xe2\x80\x99s warrant was not discovered until Investigator Anderson sought to pursue Herring five months later.  Is it not altogether obvious that the Department could take further precautions to ensure the integrity of its database?  The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department \xe2\x80\x9cis in a position to remedy the situation and might well do so if the exclusionary rule is there to remove the incentive to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 W.

See <em>ante</em>, at 9. <em> </em>In light of the paramount importance of accurate recordkeeping in law enforcement, I would answer yes, and next explain why, as I see it,\nHerring\xe2\x80\x99s motion presents a particularly strong case for suppression.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Electronic databases form the nervous system of contemporary criminal justice operations.  In recent years, their breadth and influence have dramatically expanded.  Police today can access databases that include not only the updated National Crime Information Center (NCIC), but also terrorist watchlists, the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s employee eligibility system, and various commercial databases.  Brief for Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6.  Moreover, States are actively expanding information sharing between jurisdictions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9313.<em> </em>As a result, law enforcement has an increasing supply of information within its easy electronic reach.  See Brief for Petitioner 36\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The risk of error stemming from these databases is not slim.

This concession provides little\ncomfort.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, by restricting suppression to bookkeeping errors that are deliberate or reckless, the majority leaves Herring, and others like him, with no remedy for violations of their constitutional rights.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.<em> </em>There can be no serious assertion that relief is available under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  The arresting officer would be sheltered by qualified immunity, see <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a> (1982), and the police department itself is not liable for the negligent acts of its employees, see <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U. S. 658</a> (1978).  Moreover, identifying the department employee who committed the error may be impossible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I doubt that police forces already possess sufficient incentives to maintain up-to-date records.  The Government argues that police have no desire to send officers out on arrests unnecessarily, because arrests consume resources and place officers in danger.  The facts of this case do not fit that description of police motivation.  Here the officer wanted to arrest Herring and consulted the Department\xe2\x80\x99s records to legitimate his predisposition.  See App. 17\xe2\x80\x9319.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, even when deliberate or reckless conduct is afoot, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assurance will often be an empty promise: How is an impecunious defendant to make the required showing?  If the answer is that a defendant is entitled to discovery (and if necessary, an audit of police databases), see Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9358, then the Court has imposed a considerable administrative burden on courts and law enforcement.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Negligent recordkeeping errors by law enforcement threaten individual liberty, are susceptible to deterrence by the exclusionary rule, and cannot be remedied effectively through other means.

I write separately to note one additional supporting factor that I believe important.  In <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html">514 U. S. 1</a> (1995), we held that recordkeeping errors made by a court clerk do not trigger the exclusionary rule, so long as the police reasonably relied upon the court clerk\xe2\x80\x99s recordkeeping.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14; <em>id.</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  The rationale for our decision was premised on a distinction between judicial errors and police errors, and we gave several reasons for recognizing that distinction.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusionary rule was historically designed as a means of deterring <em>police</em> misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  <em>Second</em>, we found \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence that court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  <em>Third</em>, we recognized that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule\xe2\x80\xa6 [would] have a significant effect on court employees responsible for informing the police that a warrant has been quashed.  Because court clerks are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime, they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15 (citation omitted).  Taken together, these reasons explain why police recordkeeping errors should be treated differently than judicial ones.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other cases applying the \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the exclusionary rule have similarly recognized the distinction between police errors and errors made by others, such as judicial officers or legislatures.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984) (police reasonably relied on magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of warrant); <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Sheppard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/index.html">468 U. S. 981</a> (1984) (same); <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Krull</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/340/index.html">480 U. S. 340</a> (1987) (police reasonably relied on statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Distinguishing between police recordkeeping errors and judicial ones not only is consistent with our precedent, but also is far easier for courts to administer than The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s case-by-case, multifactored inquiry into the degree of police culpability.  I therefore would apply the exclusionary rule when police personnel are responsible for a recordkeeping error that results in a Fourth Amendment violation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The need for a clear line, and the recognition of such a line in our precedent, are further reasons in support of the outcome that Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s dissent would reach.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
