Prior to the empaneling of a jury, Rodrigues\' attorney raised the defense of mental disease. Pursuant to Haw.

See Fong Foo v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html">369 U.S. 141</a>, 143 [, 672].

Washington, 434 U.S. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 469 U.S. 1078 , 497</a></p><p>, at 503 [, at 829]. The law \'attaches particular significance to an acquittal.\' United States v. Scott, 437 U.S., at 91 []." 4 </p><p> The Court has also stated that because an acquittal based upon a finding of insanity constitutes such a resolution, it may not be appealed. 5 The rationale behind the principle according acquittals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1080">Page 469 U.S. 1078 , 1080</a></p><p> special weight is that an appeal or retrial following an acquittal would produce "an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its superior resources, would wear down a defendant, thereby \'enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\' " 6 </p><p> The question presented is whether these principles apply with equal force to the period prior to the formal commencement of a trial. In other words, does jeopardy attach if the judge has tried an element of the crime prior to the empaneling of a jury? </p><p> Conceding that in this case the judge sat as a "trier of fact" on the issue of insanity, the Supreme Court of Hawaii nonetheless held that jeopardy had not attached at the time of the acquittal. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] The court relied upon Serfass v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/377/case.html">420 U.S. 377</a> ( 1975), in holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause is irrelevant to those acquittals issued prior to the empaneling of a jury or the calling of the first witness. </p><p> The court\'s reliance upon Serfass is misplaced. The indictment in Serfass was dismissed for reasons wholly unrelated to a resolution of the factual elements of the crime. The defendant, who had been refused status as a conscientious objector, was subsequently indicted for failure to report for or submit to induction. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the government had inadequately set forth its reasons for initially refusing his request for classification as a conscientious objector. The District Court agreed, and the case was dismissed for the government\'s failure to provide due process, not because the indictment was defective nor because the defendant was tried and found innocent as to the elements of the crime. </p><p> The issue in the instant case-an issue neither discussed nor addressed in Serfass -is whether jeopardy attaches to an acquittal based upon a resolution of a factual element of the crime that occurred prior to the empaneling of a jury or the calling of the first witness. The principles summarized in the above quotation from DiFrancesco strongly suggest that jeopardy does attach to such acquittals and that it is of no consequence that the defendant\'s acquittal occurred before the formal commencement of trial. The question posed by this case has engendered division amongst </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1081">Page 469 U.S. 1078 , 1081</a></p><p> the commentators 9 as well as a conflict among the Courts of Appeals. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] Because we have not addressed the question and because it is of some importance, I believe that plenary consideration is appropriate. </p><p> I therefore dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Hawaii Rev.Stat. 704-408 (1976): "Determination of irresponsibility. If the report of the examiners filed pursuant to section 704-404 states that the defendant at the time of the conduct alleged suffered from a physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect which substantially impaired his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, and the court, after a hearing if a hearing is requested, is satisfied that such impairment was sufficient to exclude responsibility, the court, on motion of the defendant, shall enter judgment of acquittal on the ground of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility." </p><p> This section was amended in 1980. Given the frequency with which the issue in this case arises and the existing conflict between the Courts of Appeals (see infra, at 1081), the amendment of the section is of no bearing on the decision to grant the petition for certiorari. </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> 67 Haw. 70, 79, 679 P.2d 615, 621 (1984). </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> United States v.
