The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) prohibits discrimination in housing against, <i>inter alios, </i>persons with handicaps.l Section 807(b)(1) of the Act entirely exempts from the FHA\'s compass "any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1). This case presents the question whether a provision in petitioner City of Edmonds\' zoning code qualifies for \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s complete exemption from FHA scrutiny. The provision, governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defines "family" as "persons [without regard to number] related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer [unrelated] persons." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) \xc2\xa7 21.30.010 (1991).</p><p>The defining provision at issue describes who may compose a family unit; it does not prescribe <i>"the </i>maximum number of occupants" a dwelling unit may house. We hold that \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the familydefining kind, i. <i>e., </i>provisions designed to foster the family character of a neighborhood. Instead, \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s absolute exemption removes from the FHA\'s scope only total occupancy limits, i. <i>e., </i>numerical ceilings that serve to prevent overcrowding in living quarters.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>In the summer of 1990, respondent Oxford House opened a group home in the City of Edmonds, Washington (City), for</p><p>1 The FHA, as originally enacted in 1968, prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. See 82 Stat. 83. Proscription of discrimination based on sex was added in 1974. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, \xc2\xa7 808(b), 88 Stat. 729. In 1988, Congress extended coverage to persons with handicaps and also prohibited "familial status" discrimination, i. <i>e., </i>discrimination against parents or other custodial persons domiciled with children under the age of 18. 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3602(k).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="729">729</a></p><p>10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction. The group home, called Oxford House-Edmonds, is located in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences. Upon learning that Oxford House had leased and was operating a home in Edmonds, the City issued criminal citations to the owner and a resident of the house. The citations charged violation of the zoning code rule that defines who may live in single-family dwelling units. The occupants of such units must compose a "family," and family, under the City\'s defining rule, "means an individual or two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer persons who are not related by genetics, adoption, or marriage." ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010. Oxford House- Edmonds houses more than five unrelated persons, and therefore does not conform to the code.</p><p>Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act, 102 Stat. 1619, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3601 <i>et seq., </i>which declares it unlawful "[t]o discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of ... that buyer or renter." \xc2\xa7 3604(f)(1)(A). The parties have stipulated, for purposes of this litigation, that the residents of Oxford House-Edmonds "are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts and are handicapped persons within the meaning" of the Act. App. 106.</p><p>Discrimination covered by the FHA includes "a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford [handicapped] person[s] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." \xc2\xa7 3604(f)(3)(B). Oxford House asked Edmonds to make a "reasonable accommodation" by allowing it to remain in the single-family dwelling it had leased. Group homes for recovering substance abusers, Oxford urged, need 8 to 12 residents to be financially and therapeutically viable. Edmonds declined to permit Oxford House to stay in a single-family residential zone, but passed an ordi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="730">730</a></p><p>nance listing group homes as permitted uses in multifamily and general commercial zones.</p><p>Edmonds sued Oxford House in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain the City\'s zoning code family definition rule. Oxford House counterclaimed under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a "reasonable accommodation" permitting maintenance of the group home in a single-family zone. The United States filed a separate action on the same FHA "reasonable accommodation" ground, and the two cases were consolidated. Edmonds suspended its criminal enforcement actions pending resolution of the federal litigation.</p><p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010, defining "family," is exempt from the FHA under \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) as a "reasonable ... restrictio[n] regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed; holding \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s absolute exemption inapplicable, the Court of Appeals remanded the cases for further consideration of the claims asserted by Oxford House and the United States. <i>Edmonds </i>v. <i>Washington State Building Code Council, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/18/802/">18 F.3d 802</a> (1994).</p><p>The Ninth Circuit\'s decision conflicts with an Eleventh Circuit decision declaring exempt under \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) a family definition provision similar to the Edmonds prescription.

The provision making it illegal to discriminate in housing against families with children under the age of 18 prompted fears that landlords would be forced to allow large families to crowd into small housing units.

Section 3607(b)(I) makes it plain that, pursuant to local prescriptions on maximum occupancy, landlords legitimately may refuse to stuff large families into small quarters. Congress further assured in \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(I) that retirement communities would be exempt from the proscription of discrimination against families with minor children. In the sentence immediately following the maximum occupancy provision, \xc2\xa73607(b)(I) states: "Nor does any provision in this subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="736">736</a></p><p>rect that dwellings be used only to house families. Captioned "USES," ECDC \xc2\xa7 16.20.010 provides that the sole "Permitted Primary U s[e]" in a single-family residential zone is "[s]ingle-family dwelling units."

But Edmonds\' family composition rule surely does not answer the question: "What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?"

This accommodation is the peg on which Edmonds rests its plea for \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) exemption. Had the City defined a family solely by biological and legal links, \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) would not have been the ground on which Edmonds staked its case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12, 16. It is curious reasoning indeed that converts a family values preserver into a maximum occupancy restriction once a town adds to a related persons prescription "and also two unrelated persons." 11</p><p>Edmonds additionally contends that subjecting singlefamily zoning to FHA scrutiny will "overturn Euclidian zoning" and "destroy the effectiveness and purpose of singlefamily zoning." Brief for Petitioner 11, 25. This contention both ignores the limited scope of the issue before us and exaggerates the force of the FHA\'s antidiscrimination provisions. We address only whether Edmonds\' family composition rule qualifies for \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) exemption. Moreover, the FHA antidiscrimination provisions, when applicable, require only "reasonable" accommodations to afford persons with handicaps "equal opportunity to use and enjoy" housing. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3604(f)(1)(A) and (f)(3)(B).</p><p>11 This curious reasoning drives the dissent. If Edmonds allowed only related persons (whatever their number) to dwell in a house in a singlefamily zone, then the dissent, it appears, would agree that the \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) exemption is unavailable. But so long as the City introduces a specific number-any number (two will do)-the City can insulate its single-family zone <i>entirely </i>from FHA coverage. The exception-takes-the-rule reading the dissent advances is hardly the "generous construction" warranted for antidiscrimination prescriptions. See <i>Trafficante </i>v. <i>Metropolitan Life </i>Ins.

It remains for the lower courts to decide whether Edmonds\' actions against Oxford House violate the FHA\'s prohibitions against discrimination set out in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3604(f)(1)(A) and (f)(3)(B).

In today\'s decision, the Court concludes that the challenged provisions of petitioner\'s zoning code do not qualify for this exemption, even though they establish a specific number-five-as the maximum number of unrelated persons permitted to occupy a dwelling in the single-family neighborhoods of Edmonds, Washington. Because the Court\'s conclusion fails to give effect to the plain language of the statute, I respectfully dissent.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Petitioner\'s zoning code reserves certain neighborhoods primarily for "[s]ingle-family dwelling units." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) \xc2\xa7 16.20.010(A)(1) (1991), App. 225. To live together in such a dwelling, a group must constitute a "family," which may be either a traditional kind of family, comprising "two or more persons re-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="739">739</a></p><p>lated by genetics, adoption, or marriage," or a nontraditional one, comprising "a group of five or fewer persons who are not [so] related." \xc2\xa7 21.30.010, App. 250. As respondent United States conceded at oral argument, the effect of these provisions is to establish a rule that "no house in [a single-family] area of the city shall have more than five occupants unless it is a [traditional kind of] family." Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. In other words, petitioner\'s zoning code establishes for certain dwellings "a five-occupant limit, [with] an exception for [traditional] families." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>To my mind, the rule that "no house ... shall have more than five occupants" (a "five-occupant limit") readily qualifies as a "restrictio[n] regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." In plain fashion, it "restrict[s]"-to five-"the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." To be sure, as the majority observes, the restriction imposed by petitioner\'s zoning code is not an absolute one, because it does not apply to related persons. See <i>ante, </i>at 736. But \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) does not set forth a narrow exemption only for "absolute" or "unqualified" restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants. Instead, it sweeps broadly to exempt <i>any </i>restrictions <i>regarding </i>such maximum number. It is difficult to imagine what broader terms Congress could have used to signify the categories or kinds of relevant governmental restrictions that are exempt from the FHA.l</p><p>1 A broad construction of the word "any" is hardly novel.

The accurate answer must surely be in the affirmative-yes, the maximum number of unrelated persons permitted to occupy a dwelling in a single-family neighborhood is five. Or consider a different example. Assume that the Federal Republic of Germany imposes no restrictions on the speed of "cars" that drive on the Autobahn but does cap the speed of "trucks" (which are defined as all other vehicles). If a conscientious visitor to Germany asks whether there are <i>"any </i>restrictions regarding the maximum speed of motor vehicles permitted to drive on the Autobahn," the accurate answer again is surely the affirmative one-yes, there is a restriction regarding the maximum speed of trucks on the Autobahn.</p><p>The majority does not ask whether petitioner\'s zoning code imposes any restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Instead, observing that pursuant to ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010, "any number of people can live in a house," so long as they are "related \'by genetics, adoption, or marriage,\'" the majority concludes that \xc2\xa7 21.30.010 does not qualify for \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s exemption because it "surely does not answer the question: \'What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 736. The majority\'s question, however, does not accord with the text of the statute. To take advantage of the exemption, a local, state, or federal law need not impose a restriction <i>establishing </i>an <i>absolute </i>maximum number of occupants; under \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1), it is necessary only that such law impose a restriction "regarding" the maximum number of occupants.

These two terms-and the two categories of zoning rules they describe-are simply irrelevant to this case.</p><p>2 It is ironic that the majority cites Uniform Housing Code \xc2\xa7 503(b) (1988), which has been incorporated into petitioner\'s zoning code, see ECDC \xc2\xa7 19.10.000, App. 248, as a "prototypical maximum occupancy restriction" that would qualify for \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s exemption. <i>Ante, </i>at 736. Because \xc2\xa7 503(b), as the majority describes it, "caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, <i>based on floor area," ibid. </i>(emphasis added), it actually caps the <i>density </i>of occupants, not their <i>number. </i>By itself, therefore, \xc2\xa7 503(b) "surely does not answer the question: \'What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?\'\'\' <i>Ibid. </i>That is, even under \xc2\xa7 503(b), there is no single absolute maximum number of occupants that applies to every house in Edmonds. Thus, the answer to the majority\'s question is the same with respect to both \xc2\xa7 503(b) and ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010: "It depends." With respect to the former, it depends on the size of the house\'s bedrooms, see <i>ante, </i>at 736 (quoting \xc2\xa7 503(b)); with respect to the latter, it depends on whether the house\'s occupants are related.</p><p>3 I would also remand the case to the Court of Appeals to allow it to pass on respondents\' argument that petitioner\'s zoning code does not satisfy \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s requirement that qualifying restrictions be "reasonable." The District Court rejected this argument, concluding that petitioner\'s "five-unrelated-person limit is reasonable as a matter of law," App. to Pet. for Cert.

C. \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) is necessary to preserve the primary operation of the FHA\'s stated policy "to provide ... for fair housing throughout the United States." \xc2\xa7 3601. Congress, the body responsible for deciding how specifically to achieve the objective of fair housing, obviously believed that \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)\'s exemption for "any ... restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling" is consistent with the FHA\'s general statement of policy.

Likewise, not one of the model codes from which the majority constructs its category of zoning rules uses that term either. See <i>ante, </i>at 733 (citing authorities). Accordingly, it is difficult to conceive how Congress, in 1988, could have "enacted \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) against the backdrop of an evident distinction between municipal land-use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions." <i>Ante, </i>at 732.</p><p>In this context, the majority seizes on a phrase that appears in a booklet published jointly by the American Public Health Association and the Centers for Disease Control-" \'the maximum number of individuals permitted to reside in a dwelling unit, or rooming unit.\'\'\' <i>Ante, </i>at 733, n. 6 (quoting APHA-CDC Recommended Minimum Housing Standards \xc2\xa7 2.51, p. 12 (1986)). Even if, as the majority boldly asserts, this phrase "bears a marked resemblance to the formulation Congress used in \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1)," <i>ante, </i>at 733, n. 6, I fail to comprehend how that would add to our understanding of the statute. The majority surely cannot hope to invoke the rule that where" \'Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.\'\'\' <i>Molzofv.

Rather, the majority makes the far more narrow claim that the statutory language "surely encompasses" that category. <i>Ante, </i>at 734. I readily concede this point.6 But the obvious conclusion that \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) encompasses "maximum occupancy restrictions" tells us nothing about whether the statute <i>also </i>encompasses ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010, the zoning rule at issue here. In other words, although the majority\'s discussion will no doubt provide guidance in future cases, it is completely irrelevant to the question presented in <i>this </i>case.</p><p>The majority fares no better in its treatment of "family composition rules," a term employed by the majority to describe yet another invented category of zoning restrictions. Although today\'s decision seems to hinge on the majority\'s judgment that ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010 is a "classic exampl[e] of a ... family composition rule," <i>ante, </i>at 735, the majority says virtually nothing about this crucial category. Thus, it briefly alludes to the derivation of "family composition rules" and provides a single example of them.7 Apart from these two references, however, the majority\'s analysis consists</p><p>6 According to the majority, its conclusion that \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(I) encompasses all "maximum occupancy restrictions" is "reinforced by" H. R. Rep. No. 100-711, p. 31 (1988). See <i>ante, </i>at 734, n. 8.

See <i>ibid. </i>(referring to "rules designed to preserve the family character of a neighborhood, fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living quarters can contain").</p><p>Although the majority does not say so explicitly, one might infer from its belated definition of "family composition rules" that \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) does not encompass zoning rules that have one particular purpose ("to preserve the family character of a neighborhood") or those that refer to the qualitative as well as the quantitative character of a dwelling (by "fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living quarters can contain"). <i>Ibid. </i>Yet terms like "family character," "composition of households," "total [that is, absolute] number of occupants," and "living quarters" are noticeably absent from the text of the statute. Section 3607(b)(1) limits neither the permissible purposes of a qualifying zoning restriction nor the ways in which such a restriction may accomplish its purposes. Rather, the exemption encompasses "any" zoning restriction-whatever its purpose and by whatever means it accomplishes that purpose-so long as the restriction "regard[s]" the maximum number of occupants. See generally <i>supra, </i>at 739-742. As I have explained, petitioner\'s zoning code does precisely that.8</p><p>8 All that remains of the majority\'s case is the epithet that my reasoning is "curious" because it yields an "exception-takes-the-rule reading" of \xc2\xa73607(b)(I). <i>Ante, </i>at 737, n. 11. It is not clear why the majority thinks my reading will eviscerate the FHA\'s antidiscrimination prescriptions. The FHA protects handicapped persons from traditionally defined (intentional) discrimination, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3604(f)(1), (2), and three kinds of specially defined discrimination: "refusal to permit ... reasonable modifications of existing premises"; "refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services"; and "failure to design and con-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="748">748</a></p><p>In sum, it does not matter that ECDC \xc2\xa7 21.30.010 describes "[f]amily living, not living space per occupant," <i>ante, </i>at 737, because it is immaterial under \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) whether \xc2\xa7 21.30.010 constitutes a "family composition rule" but not a "maximum occupancy restriction." The sole relevant question is whether petitioner\'s zoning code imposes "any ... restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling."

In addition, because the exemption refers to "local, State, or Federal restrictions," even the broadest reading of \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1) could not possibly insulate <i>private </i>refusals to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped persons. Finally, as I have already noted, see <i>supra, </i>at 741, n. 3, restrictions must be "reasonable" in order to be exempted by \xc2\xa7 3607(b)(1).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
