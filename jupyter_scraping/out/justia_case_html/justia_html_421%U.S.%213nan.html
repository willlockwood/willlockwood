JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the application of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1443(1), permitting defendants in state cases to remove the proceedings to the federal district courts under certain conditions, in the light of Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, \xc2\xa7 101(a), 82 Stat. 73, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 245.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>During March 1972, petitioners, six Negro citizens of Vicksburg, Miss., along with other citizens of Vicksburg, made various demands upon certain merchants and city officials generally relating to the number of Negroes employed or serving in various positions in both local government and business enterprises.  In late March, petitioners began picketing some business establishments in Vicksburg and urging, by word of mouth and through leaflets, that the citizens of Vicksburg boycott those establishments until such time as petitioners\' demands were realized. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On May 2, 13, 14, and 21 of that year, petitioners, along with 43 other Negroes, were arrested [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] on the basis of warrants charging, in general terms, their complicity in a conspiracy unlawfully to bring about a boycott of merchants and businesses. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  At least some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 421 U. S. 216</a></p><p> of these arrests took place at a time when some of those arrested were engaged in picketing in protest of the racial discrimination allegedly practiced by certain merchants of Vicksburg.  Following the arrests, which were made by Vicksburg police officers, those arrested were transported to the city jail, where they each remained after processing until the posting of bail.  There is no indication in the record in this case that the arrests and subsequent detentions of petitioners or the other 43 persons so arrested and detained involved the application of any force by the arresting officers beyond the verbal directions issued by those officers and the coercive custody normally incident to arrest, processing, and detention.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 1972, those arrested filed a petition in the Federal District Court in compliance with the procedures established by 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1446 seeking transfer of the trial of charges against them to the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1443, which reads, in pertinent part, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] as follows:</p>\n<p>"Any of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State court, may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending: "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 421 U. S. 217</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof. . . ."</p>\n<p>In their removal petition, it was alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that those arrested were being prosecuted under several state conspiracy statutes [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] which were, "on their face and as applied, repugnant to the Constitution . . . ," and that:</p>\n<p>"The charges against petitioners, their arrest, and subsequent prosecution on those charges have no basis, in fact, and have been effectuated solely and exclusively for the purpose and effect of depriving petitioners of their Federally protected rights, including by force or threat of force, punishing, injuring, intimidating, and interferring [<em>sic</em>], or attempting to punish, injure, intimidate, . . . and interfere with petitioners, and the class of persons participating in the . . . boycott and demonstrations, for the exercise of their rights peacefully to protest discrimination and to conduct and publicize a boycott which seeks to remedy the denial of equal civil rights . . . which activities are protected by 18 U.S.C. [\xc2\xa7] 245."</p>\n<p>On December 29, 1972, after an evidentiary hearing was held by the District Court in which testimony was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 421 U. S. 218</a></p><p> presented both by petitioners and the Vicksburg chief of police, who was one of the named respondents to the removal petition, the District Court remanded the prosecutions to the state courts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] reasoning that \xc2\xa7 245, as a criminal statute, "confers no rights whatsoever . . . ," 488 F.2d 284, 287 (CA5 1974), and that, under this Court\'s decisions in <em>Georgia v. Rachel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html">384 U. S. 780</a></span> (1966), and <em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html">384 U. S. 808</a></span> (1966), a federal statute must "provide" for the equal rights of citizens before it can be invoked as a basis for removal of prosecutions under \xc2\xa7 1443(1).  Rehearing and rehearing en banc, Fed.Rule App.Proc. 35, were denied, five Circuit Judges dissenting in an opinion. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  491 F.2d 94 (CA5 1974).  We granted certiorari, 419 U.S. 893 (1974), and, for reasons stated below, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 421 U. S. 219</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our most recent cases construing \xc2\xa7 1443(1) are the companion cases of <em>Georgia v. Rachel, supra,</em> and <em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock, supra.</em>  Those cases established that a removal petition under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1443(1) must satisfy a two-pronged test.  First, it must appear that the right allegedly denied the removal petitioner arises under a federal law "providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality."  <em>Georgia v. Rachel, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#792">384 U. S. 792</a></span>.  Claims that prosecution and conviction will violate rights under constitutional or statutory provisions of general applicability or under statutes not protecting against racial discrimination, will not suffice.  That a removal petitioner will be denied due process of law because the criminal law under which he is being prosecuted is allegedly vague or that the prosecution is assertedly a sham, corrupt, or without evidentiary basis does not, standing alone, satisfy the requirements of \xc2\xa7 1443(1).  <em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#825">384 U. S. 825</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Second, it must appear, in accordance with the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1443(1), that the removal petitioner is "denied or cannot enforce" the specified federal rights "in the courts of [the] State."  This provision normally requires that the "denial be manifest in a formal expression of state law," <em>Georgia v. Rachel, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#803">384 U. S. 803</a></span>, such as a state legislative or constitutional provision, "<em>rather than a denial first made manifest at the trial of the case.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#799">384 U. S. 799</a></span>.  Except in the unusual case where\n</em></p>\n<p>"an equivalent basis could be shown for an equally firm prediction that the defendant would be \'denied or cannot enforce\' the specified federal rights in the state court,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#804">384 U. S. 804</a></span>, it was to be expected that the protection of federal constitutional or statutory rights could be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 421 U. S. 220</a></p><p> effected in the pending state proceedings, civil or criminal.  Under \xc2\xa7 1443(1),</p>\n<p>"the vindication of the defendant\'s federal rights is left to the state courts except in he rare situations where it can be clearly predicted by reason of the operation of a pervasive and explicit state or federal law that those rights will inevitably be denied by the very act of bringing the defendant to trial in the state court."</p>\n<p><em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#828">384 U. S. 828</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Rachel,</em> the allegations of the petition for removal were held to satisfy both branches of the rule.  The federal right claimed arose under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 201(a) and 203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000a(a) and 2000a-2(c).  Section 201(a) forbids refusals of service in, or exclusions from, public accommodations on account of race or color; and \xc2\xa7 203(c) prohibits any "attempt to punish any person for exercising or attempting to exercise any right or privilege secured by section 201. . . ."  The removal petition fairly alleged that the prosecutions sought to be removed from state court were brought and would be tried "solely as the result of peaceful attempts to obtain service at places of public accommodation."  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#793">384 U. S. 793</a></span>. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We concluded that, if the allegations in the removal petition were true, the defendants by being prosecuted under a state criminal trespass law would be denied or could not enforce their rights in the courts of Georgia, since the "burden of having to defend the prosecutions is itself the denial of a right explicitly conferred by the Civil Rights Act of 1964."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#805">384 U. S. 805</a></span>.  In <em>Peacock,</em> on the contrary, the state court defendants </p><p><a class="page-number" name="221">Page 421 U. S. 221</a></p><p> petitioning for removal were being prosecuted for obstructing public streets, assault and battery, and various other local crimes. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The federal rights allegedly being denied were said to arise under the Constitution as well as under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1971 and 1981, the former section guaranteeing the right to vote without discrimination on the grounds of race or color and forbidding interference therewith, and the latter guaranteeing all persons equal access to specified rights enjoyed by white persons. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The Court assumed that the claimed statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="222">Page 421 U. S. 222</a></p><p> rights were within those rights contemplated by \xc2\xa7 1443(1), but went on to hold that there had been no showing that petitioners would be denied or could not enforce their rights in the state courts.  The removal petitions alleged</p>\n<p>"(1) that the defendants were arrested by state officers and charged with various offenses under state law because they were Negroes or because they were engaged in helping Negroes assert their rights under federal equal civil rights laws, and that they are completely innocent of the charges against them, or (2) that the defendants will be unable to obtain a fair trial in the state court."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#826">384 U. S. 826</a></span>.  The Court held, however, that it was not enough to support removal to allege that</p>\n<p>"federal equal civil rights have been illegally and corruptly denied by state administrative officials in advance of trial, that the charges against the defendant are false, or that the defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a particular state court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#827">384 U. S. 827</a></span>.  Petitioners could point to no federal law conferring on them the right to engage in the specific conduct with which they were charged, and there was no "federal statutory right that no State should even attempt to prosecute them for their conduct."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#826">384 U. S. 826</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>With our prior cases in mind, it is apparent, without further discussion, that removal under \xc2\xa7 1443(1) was not warranted here based solely on petitioners\' allegations that the statutes underlying the charges against them were unconstitutional, that there was no basis in fact for those charges, or that their arrest and prosecution otherwise denied them their constitutional rights.  We are also convinced for the following reasons that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="223">Page 421 U. S. 223</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 245, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] on which petitioners principally rely, does not furnish adequate basis for removal under \xc2\xa7 1443(1) of these state prosecutions to the federal court.</p>\n<p>Whether or not \xc2\xa7 24, a federal criminal statute, provides for "specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality . . . ," <em>Georgia v. Rachel,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#792">384 U. S. 792</a></span>, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="224">Page 421 U. S. 224</a></p><p> evinces no intention to interfere in any manner with state criminal prosecutions of those who seek to have their cases removed to the federal courts.  On the contrary, \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1) itself expressly provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this section shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress to prevent any State . . . from exercising jurisdiction over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the absence of this section. . . . [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Mississippi courts undoubtedly have jurisdiction over conspiracy and boycott cases brought under state law; and \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1) appears to disavow any intent to interrupt such state prosecutions, a conclusion that is also implicit in the operative provisions of that section.  Section 245(b) makes it a crime for any persons, by "force or threat of force," to injure, intimidate, or interfere with any individual engaged in specified activities.  The provision, on its face, focuses on the use of force, and its legislative history confirms that its central purpose was to prevent and punish violent interferences with the exercise of specified rights, and that it was not aimed at interrupting or frustrating the otherwise orderly processes of state law.</p>\n<p>Section 245, which was Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, was the antidote prescribed by Congress to deter and punish those who would forcibly suppress the free exercise of civil rights enumerated in that statute.  The bill which eventually became Title I, H.R. 2516, was substantially identical to H.R. 14765, passed by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="225">Page 421 U. S. 225</a></p><p> House as Title V of the Civil Rights Act of 1966. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Title I was enacted against a background of racial violence described in the Report of the bill that was adopted by the House:</p>\n<p>"The brutal crimes committed in recent years against Negroes exercising Federal rights and against white persons who have encouraged or aided Negroes seeking equality need no recital.  Violence and threats of violence have been resorted to in order to punish or discourage Negroes from voting, from using places of public accommodation and public facilities, from attending desegregated schools, and from engaging in other activities protected by Federal law.  Frequently the victim of the crime has recently engaged or is then engaging in the exercise of a Federal right.  In other cases, the victim is a civil rights worker -- white or Negro -- who has encouraged others to assert these rights or engaged in peaceful assembly opposing their denial.  In still other cases, Negroes not known to have had anything to do with civil rights activities have been killed or assaulted to discourage other Negroes from asserting their rights."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep.

S.Rep. No. 721, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1967).  This concern with racially motivated acts of violence pervaded the report, <em>see id.</em> at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  In the debate on the floor of the Senate, frequent references to the bill\'s being directed at crimes of racial violence were made, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] the following being particularly relevant here:</p>\n<p>"This new law would provide that, when a law enforcement officer totally abandons his duty in order to violently intimidate individuals seeking </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 421 U.

That section furnishes federal protection against violence in certain circumstances.  But whatever "rights" it may confer, none of them is denied by a state criminal prosecution for conspiracy or boycott.

None of those bills was reported from the cognizant committee of Congress; none has been reported in the intervening years; and the parties have informed us of no comparable bill under active consideration in the present Congress.  The absence of any evidence or legislative history indicating that Congress intended to accomplish in \xc2\xa7 245 what it has failed or refused to do directly through amendment to \xc2\xa7 1443 necessitates our considered rejection of the right of removal in this case.  Also, as we noted in <em>Peacock,</em> there are varied avenues of relief open to these defendants for vindication of any of their federal rights that may have been or will be violated, 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#828">384 U.

S. 808</a></span> (1966), correctly construed the civil rights removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1443.  <em>See New York v. Galamison,</em> 342 F.2d 255, 275 (CA2) (Marshall, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied,</em> 380 U.S. 977 (1965).  On that broader view of the statute, removal would plainly be proper here, and if the Federal District Court determined that the state proceedings were being used to deny federally protected rights, it would be required to dismiss the prosecution.  <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#840">384 U. S. 840</a></span>-848 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).  Even under <em>Peacock</em> and its companion case, <em>Georgia v. Rachel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html">384 U. S. 780</a></span> (1966), however, I think that removal should have been available on the particular facts of this case.</p>\n<p>As the Court today observes, <em>Rachel</em> and <em>Peacock</em> imposed sharp limitations on the scope of the removal statute.  The statute was held to permit removal only in the rare case in which (1) the federal right at issue stemmed from a law providing expressly for equal civil rights; (2) the conduct with which the removal petitioners were charged was arguably protected by the federal law in question; and (3) the federal law granted the further right not only to engage in the conduct in question, but to be free from arrest and prosecution by state officials for that conduct.  Focusing on the third requirement, the Court today holds that Title I of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 245, does not provide a right to be free from arrest and prosecution for engaging in specific federally protected conduct.  In my </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 421 U. S. 230</a></p><p> view, the three requirements from <em>Peacock</em> were satisfied to the extent necessary to call for a full hearing on the removal petition, and I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals based its ruling on the first of the three requirements, holding that \xc2\xa7 245 was not a "law providing for . . . equal civil rights."  The court reasoned that the statute failed to meet this requirement because it did not "provide" any substantive rights, but merely supplied a criminal sanction for the violation of rights that had been elsewhere created.  This misses the point. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if \xc2\xa7 245 is regarded solely as creating criminal penalties for interference with previously established civil rights, it certainly "provid[es] for" those rights by facilitating their exercise.  Congress plainly intended \xc2\xa7 245 in part to render certain rights meaningful, even though the rights themselves had, in some instances, been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 421 U. S. 231</a></p><p> created in prior legislation.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 721, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 4-6 (1967); H.R.Rep. No. 473, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 5-7 (1967).  If Congress had provided private legal or equitable remedies for the vindication of preexisting rights, such a statute would certainly be deemed one "providing for" equal civil rights.  The fact that Congress has invoked the criminal sanction to protect and enforce those rights, rather than relying on private remedies, should make no difference.</p>\n<p>In any event, \xc2\xa7 245 does more than enforce preexisting rights:  in several respects, it creates rights that had no previous statutory recognition.  First, the statute protects not only those participating in the exercise of equal civil rights, but also those "encouraging other persons to participate" and those "participating lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly opposing any denial of the opportunity to so participate," \xc2\xa7 245(b)(5).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 721, <em>supra,</em> at 4.  Second, because it is based on \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Commerce Clause, \xc2\xa7 245 goes beyond the specific protections of prior civil rights laws in various particulars.  As the House Report noted:</p>\n<p>"[T]he scope of the activities described in section [245(b)] is not limited to the scope of the \'rights\' created by other Federal laws outlawing discrimination with respect to those activities.  Accordingly, in appropriate cases, . . . the bill would reach forcible interference with employment, regardless of the size and regardless of the public or private character of the employer; with service in all of the described types of places of public accommodation, whether or not they happen to fall within the scope of the 1964 Civil Rights Act; and with common carrier transportation whether interstate or intrastate."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 473, <em>supra,</em> at 5.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="232">Page 421 U. S. 232</a></p><p> Finally, the statute goes beyond protecting against racially motivated misconduct by state officials and those acting in concert with them.  It reaches racially motivated conduct by private individuals as well, thus extending both a right against, and a remedy for, certain private misconduct.  The inclusion of private individuals within the reach of \xc2\xa7 245 was a topic of intense dispute during the congressional debates over the statute.  Both the advocates and opponents of the statute recognized that \xc2\xa7 245 would criminalize a whole new sphere of conduct, and thus significantly expand the scope of federal statutory protection for civil rights.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 721, <em>supra,</em> at 7-8, 21-26; 113 Cong.Rec. 22763-22764 (1967); 114 Cong.Rec. 319, 389-391, 539-544 (1968).  In view of the statute\'s broad remedial purposes and effects, only on the most grudging reading can it be said not to "provid[e] for equal civil rights."</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has discussed the second requirement for \xc2\xa7 1443 removal, I believe that, under <em>Rachel</em> and <em>Peacock,</em> a sufficient showing has been made to require further proceedings below.  The Court in <em>Peacock</em> established that, where the state criminal charge includes allegations of conduct clearly unprotected by federal law, removal is not available.  In that case, the state charges included obstruction of the streets, assault, and interference with a police officer -- all forms of conduct not even arguably protected under federal law.  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/case.html#826">384 U. S. 826</a></span>-827. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="233">Page 421 U. S. 233</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Rachel,</em> by contrast, the Court observed that the defendants had been charged only with violating the state criminal trespass statute, which required that a person leave a place of business when requested to do so by the owner.  The defendants alleged in their removal petitions that they had remained on the premises of the privately owned restaurants where they were arrested in the course of seeking service to which they were entitled by the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Thus, none of the conduct that the defendants were allegedly engaged in fell plainly outside the protection of federal law, as was the case in <em>Peacock.</em>  Accordingly, the District Court was instructed to hold a hearing to determine whether the defendants were ordered to leave the restaurant facilities solely for racial reasons, and whether the conduct was, in fact, within the protection of federal law -- in that case by determining whether the restaurants in question were within the coverage of the Civil Rights Act.  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#805">384 U. S. 805</a></span> and n. 31.</p>\n<p>On this point, the instant case is controlled by <em>Rachel,</em> rather than <em>Peacock.</em>  The arrest affidavits charged merely that the petitioners had conspired to promote a boycott of merchants and businessmen, and that they had engaged in and promoted acts "injurious to trade or commerce among the public."  App. 3-17.  In their removal papers, the petitioners alleged that the conduct underlying their arrests on these charges was wholly within </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 421 U. S. 234</a></p><p> the protection of federal law. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  There is nothing in the arrest affidavits or the statute under which the petitioners were charged that rebuts this claim.  The line between <em>Rachel</em> and <em>Peacock</em> is that between</p>\n<p>"prosecutions in which the conduct necessary to constitute the state offense is specifically protected by a federal equal rights statute under the circumstances alleged by the petitioner, and prosecutions where the only grounds for removal are that the charge is false and motivated by a desire to discourage the petitioner from exercising or to penalize him for having exercised a federal right."</p>\n<p><em>New York v. Davis,</em> 411 F.2d 750, 754 (CA2), <em>cert. denied,</em> 396 U.S. 856 (1969).  Like <em>Rachel,</em> this case falls into the former category.  Accordingly, the courts below should determine whether the petitioners\' conduct was, in fact, protected.  If it was, the prosecutions should be dismissed. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 421 U. S. 235</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Finally, the <em>Rachel-Peacock</em> test requires that the federal law invoked by the petitioners must do more than merely provide a defense to conviction:  it must immunize them from arrest and prosecution for the conduct in question.  In <em>Rachel,</em> the Court held that this test was met, since \xc2\xa7 203 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act provided:</p>\n<p>"No person shall . . . (c) punish or attempt to punish any person for exercising or attempting to exercise any right or privilege secured by section 201 or 202."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000a-2(c).  The rights protected by \xc2\xa7 201 included the right to "full and equal enjoyment of the . . . facilities . . . of any place of public accommodation . . . without discrimination . . . on the ground of race."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000a(a).  Viewing this language in light of a subsequent construction in <em>Hamm v. City of Rock Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/306/case.html">379 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/306/case.html#311">379 U. S. 311</a></span> (1964), the Court in <em>Rachel</em> concluded that, if the facts in the removal petition were found to be true, the defendants would not only be immune from conviction under the Georgia trespass statute, but they would also have a right under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 "not even to be brought to trial on these charges in the Georgia courts."  384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#794">384 U. S. 794</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court today distinguishes the language of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 245 from that of \xc2\xa7 203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000a-2(c), holding that the former does not grant the same immunity from prosecution that was implied in the latter.  To me, the language of the two statutes is not sufficiently different to support such a distinction.  While the statute in <em>Rachel</em> provided that no person should "punish or attempt to punish" a person engaged in conduct protected under the Act, the statute at issue here provides sanctions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 421 U. S. 236</a></p><p> against anyone who,</p>\n<p>"whether or not acting under color of law, by force or threat of force willfully injures, intimidates or interferes with, or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with"</p>\n<p>any person who is engaged in protected civil rights activity or is "lawfully aiding or encouraging other persons to participate" in various protected activities.  The use of force or the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with persons engaged in protected activity fairly describes an "attempt to punish" the same persons, and it would seem plainly to include pretextual arrests such as are alleged to have occurred in this case. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Besides the difference in language between \xc2\xa7 203(c) and \xc2\xa7 245, the Court points to two other factors that it contends provide a further basis for denying removal here.  I do not find either to be dispositive.</p>\n<p>First, the Court relies on \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1), in which Congress emphasized that \xc2\xa7 245 was not intended to prevent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 421 U. S. 237</a></p><p> "any State . . . from exercising jurisdiction over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the absence of this section. . . ."  The Court argues that this "nonpreemption" provision indicates that \xc2\xa7 245 "appears to disavow any intent to interrupt . . . state prosecutions [for offenses such as boycotting and conspiracy]."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/213/case.html#224">421 U. S. 224</a></span>.  I cannot agree that \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1) means to do that much.  The legislative history of this subsection indicates that it was intended to avoid the risk that \xc2\xa7 245 would be read to bar or interfere with state prosecutions of those who violated \xc2\xa7 245 as well as parallel state laws.  The fear was that \xc2\xa7 245, because of its potential breadth, might appear to give preemptive authority to federal law officers in prosecuting a broad spectrum of offenses that were traditionally subject to local criminal jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  There is no indication in the legislative history </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 421 U. S. 238</a></p><p> that \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1) was intended to defeat removal of state prosecutions by those protected under the Act, nor is there any suggestion that it was meant to reduce the protection for the beneficiaries of \xc2\xa7 245 in an other way.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court relies heavily on the main purpose of \xc2\xa7 245:  to penalize violent interference with the exercise of specific rights.  Certainly, violent interference with the exercise of civil rights was a primary target of the statute.  But curbing private violence was not the drafters\' sole aim.  The Act was intended to reach law enforcement officers as well as private citizens, and the process of arrest and prosecution in state courts is precisely the means by which state officials, acting under color of State law, can most plausibly exert force or the threat of force to interfere with federally protected rights.  <em>See Perkins v. Mississippi,</em> 455 F.2d 7, 11, 391 (CA5 1972) (Brown, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court is correct, of course, in noting that Congress did not expressly indicate that \xc2\xa7 245 should be available as a means of removing prosecutions to federal courts.  But the Court in <em>Rachel</em> did not require any showing that Congress had specifically intended the statute in issue to be used as a vehicle for removal.  All that was necessary was that the statute protect against the institution of criminal actions against those engaged in protected federal rights, and, in my view, that standard is met here.8 [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 421 U. S. 239</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>If the facts of this case are as alleged in the removal petition, then the protest effort of the petitioners and their group, although well within the protection of federal law, has been muffled, if not altogether stilled, by discriminatory and cynical misuse of the state criminal process.  The Court makes reference to the possibility of federal injunctive relief, which would be available in this case if the petitioners can show that the arrests and prosecutions were instituted in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment.  <em>See Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#482">380 U. S. 482</a></span>, 490 (1965); <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#47">401 U. S. 47</a></span>-50 (1971).  I only hope that the recent instances in which this Court has emphasized the values of comity and federalism in restricting the issuance of federal injunctions against state criminal and <em>quasi</em>-criminal proceedings will not mislead the district courts into forgetting that, at times, these values must give way to the need to protect federal rights from being irremediably trampled.  The possibility that the petitioners might be vindicated in state court criminal actions or through subsequent habeas corpus relief will do little to restore what has been lost:  the right to engage in legitimate, if unpopular, protest without being subjected to the inconvenience, the expense, and the ignominy of arrest and prosecution.  If the federal courts abandon persons like the petitioners in this case without a fair hearing on the merits of their claims, then, in my view, comity will have been bought at too great a cost.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the District Court initially held a hearing on the removal petition and made various factual findings adverse to the petitioners, the Court of Appeals disposed of the case without reviewing the findings of the District Court.  I would therefore remand the case to the Court of Appeals to review the findings relevant to the availability of removal and to order further proceedings if necessary.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals acknowledged that \xc2\xa7 245 met the requirement that the statute under which removal is claimed be a law dealing with "specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality," <em>Georgia v. Rachel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html">384 U. S. 780</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/case.html#792">384 U. S. 792</a></span> (1966).  <em>See</em> 488 F.2d 284, 286 (CA5 1974).  The statute was plainly addressed to problems associated with the exercise and advocacy of minority rights.  Like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and unlike the more general constitutional and statutory provisions that were rejected as bases for removal in <em>Rachel</em> and <em>Peacock,</em> \xc2\xa7 245(b)(2) refers throughout to conduct premised on racial discrimination.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court rejected the argument made in dissent that it was the allegations in the removal petition that should be looked to in determining whether the conduct was arguably protected by federal law, not the charges filed in the state proceeding.  As has been suggested elsewhere, relying on the charges to determine whether the conduct is protected would immunize from removal any case in which the state charges included allegations of conduct plainly outside the scope of federal protection.  <em>See</em> H. Hart &amp; H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1228 (2d ed.1973); <em>Perkins v. Mississippi,</em> 455 F.2d 7, 11, 31-33 (CA5 1972) (Brown, C.J., dissenting); Comment, Civil Rights Removal after <em>Rachel</em> and <em>Peacock:</em>  A Limited Federal Remedy, 121 U.Pa.L.Rev. 351, 368 (1972).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Specifically, the petitioners alleged that, in order to protest various forms of private and public racial discrimination, they</p>\n<p>"began to peacefully and lawfully picket the business establishment of [offending] merchants in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and began to urge the citizens of Vicksburg to boycott these business establishments.  All of this picketing by the petitioners and other members of their class was done in a lawful and peaceful manner, and without infringing upon the rights of any other citizen of Vicksburg. . . ."</p>\n<p>App. 22.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondents contend in their brief that the petitioners were arrested for acts ranging from engaging in a secondary boycott to physically interfering with and intimidating a customer who was trading with a white merchant.  The petitioners respond that both the arrest affidavits and the testimony at the remand hearing before the District Court were to the effect that they were all arrested pursuant to the general state conspiracy statute, and specifically for entering into "a conspiracy harmful to trade or commerce."  <em>Id.</em> at 30.  Since the remand order was the only judgment before the Court of Appeals, it is not clear what effect subsequent actions taken by state officials would have on the removal suit on appeal.  In any event, because of the continuing dispute over what state statute was used as the basis for the charges in state court, and correspondingly, what conduct was alleged, the question whether the conduct was protected under federal law is one that should be left to the courts below to determine on remand.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court notes "the similarity between the language of \xc2\xa7 1971(b) . . . and the comparable language of \xc2\xa7 245(b)," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/213/case.html#221">421 U. S. 221</a></span> n. 10.  The statutes do, indeed, have similar language, but the conduct protected under \xc2\xa7 1971(b) is <em>voting,</em> and there was no allegation in <em>Peacock</em> that the defendants were engaged in voting.  It was unnecessary for the Court to determine whether \xc2\xa7 1971(b), or a statute with similar prohibitory language, would provide a means for removal because (1) the conduct with which the defendants were charged was not protected under <em>any</em> federal law; and (2) their conduct, as alleged in their own removal petition, was not within the scope of \xc2\xa7 1971(b).</p>\n<p>Another statute, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973i(b), which was enacted after the removal in <em>Peacock,</em> protected those urging others to exercise their rights to vote, and thus would have reached the conduct in which the <em>Peacock</em> defendants claimed to have been engaged.  <em>See Whatley v. City of Vidalia,</em> 399 F.2d 521 (CA5 1968).  Even under that statute, however, removal would not have been available in <em>Peacock</em> because the conduct with which the defendants were charged in the state court proceeding was unprotected by that or all other federal law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 245(a)(1) had its origin in an amendment offered to the House bill by Representative Whitener.  In his words, the amendment was intended to ensure:</p>\n<p>"[N]othing contained in this act shall indicate an intent on the part of Congress to occupy the field in which any provision of the act operates to the exclusion of State laws on the same subject matter, nor shall any provision of this act be construed as invalidating any provision of State law unless such provision is inconsistent with any of the purposes of this act or any provision thereof. . . .  Without the amendment, there would be an unwarranted deprivation of criminal jurisdiction now exercised by the several States in most of the fields of criminal law touched by this bill."</p>\n<p>113 Cong Rec. 22745 (1967).  <em>See also id.</em> at 22683 (Rep. Whitener).</p>\n<p>In the Senate, the final language of \xc2\xa7 245(a)(1) was adopted as part of Senator Dirksen\'s amendment to the bill.  The explanation of the provision given to the Senate was as follows:</p>\n<p>"Section (a) of the bill expresses the intent of Congress not to supersede state and local law enforcement except where required by the public interest in order to obtain substantial justice.  In all cases, state and local law would continue to apply, and would not be preempted by federal law.  However, in those situations when state and local law enforcement is unable or unwilling to prosecute effectively, federal prosecution may be undertaken.  To assure that decisions relating to exercise of this dual jurisdiction are carefully made, the bill requires advance certification of prosecutorial authority by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General."</p>\n<p>114 Cong.Rec. 4907 (1968).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>In its analysis, the Court relies in part on a statement by Senator Kennedy to the effect that a state law enforcement officer reasonably believing that he is doing his duty, would not violate \xc2\xa7 245, which requires at least knowing interference with civil rights.  The interference alleged in the removal petition, however, is intentional interference, which would fall within the literal terms of the statute.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
