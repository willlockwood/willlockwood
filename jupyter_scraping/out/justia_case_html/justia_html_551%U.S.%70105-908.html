The Seattle district, which has never operated legally segregated schools or been subject to court-ordered desegregation, classified children as white or nonwhite, and used the racial classifications as a \xe2\x80\x9ctiebreaker\xe2\x80\x9d to allocate slots in particular high schools.  The Jefferson County, Ky., district was subject to a desegregation decree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation to the greatest extent practicable.  In 2001, the district adopted its plan classifying students as black or \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d in order to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, an organization of Seattle parents (Parents Involved) and the mother of a Jefferson County student (Joshua), whose children were or could be assigned under the foregoing plans, filed these suits contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that allocating children to different public schools based solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection guarantee.  In the Seattle case, the District Court granted the school district summary judgment, finding, <em>inter alia,</em> that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In the Jefferson County case, the District Court found that the school district had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools, and that its plan was, in all relevant respects, narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.   </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, 426 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162; No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, 416 F.\xc2\xa03d 513, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III\xe2\x80\x93A, and III\xe2\x80\x93C, concluding:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Court has jurisdiction in these cases.  Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because its current members\xe2\x80\x99 claimed injuries are not imminent and are too speculative in that, even if the district maintains its current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, those members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a high school that is oversubscribed and integration positive.  This argument is unavailing; the group\xe2\x80\x99s members have children in all levels of the district\xe2\x80\x99s schools, and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of members whose elementary and middle school children may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice in the future.  The fact that those children may not be denied such admission based on their race because of undersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them does not eliminate the injury claimed.  The group also asserted an interest in not being forced to compete in a race-based system that might prejudice its members\xe2\x80\x99 children, an actionable form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause, see, <em>e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 211.  The fact that Seattle has ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dispositive, since the district vigorously defends its program\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality, and nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign students if it prevails.  See <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U. S. 167</a>, 189.  Similarly, the fact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction; Jefferson County\xe2\x80\x99s racial guidelines apply at all grade levels and he may again be subject to race-based assignment in middle school.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of showing that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means they have chosen\xe2\x80\x94discriminating among individual students based on race by relying upon racial classifications in making school assignments.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317, 25\xe2\x80\x9328.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because \xe2\x80\x9cracial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fullilove</em> v. <em>Klutznick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/448/index.html">448 U. S. 448</a>, 537 (Stevens, J., dissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or benefits based on individual racial classifications are reviewed under strict scrutiny, <em>e.g., Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/499/index.html">543 U. S. 499</a>, 505\xe2\x80\x93506.  Thus, the school districts must demonstrate that their use of such classifications is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d government interest.  <em>Adarand, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination is a compelling interest under the strict scrutiny test, see <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>Pitts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/467/index.html">503 U. S. 467</a>, 494, that interest is not involved here because the Seattle schools were never segregated by law nor subject to court-ordered desegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jefferson County schools were previously subject has been dissolved.  Moreover, these cases are not governed by <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny purposes, a government interest in student body diversity \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of higher education\xe2\x80\x9d is compelling.  That interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed \xe2\x80\x9call factors that may contribute to student body diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 337, including, <em>e.g.,</em> having \xe2\x80\x9covercome personal adversity and family hardship,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.,</em> at 338.  Quoting Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s articulation of diversity in <em>Regents of the University of California </em>v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a>, 314\xe2\x80\x93315, the <em>Grutter </em>Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,\xe2\x80\x99 that can justify the use of race,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 U. S., at 324\xe2\x80\x93325, but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 325.  In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cexposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 330; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone.  The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in <em>Grutter</em>; it is <em>the</em> factor.  See <em>Gratz</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/244/index.html">539 U. S. 244</a>, 275.  Even as to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/\xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d terms in Jefferson County.  The <em>Grutter</em> Court expressly limited its holding\xe2\x80\x94defining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher education\xe2\x80\x94but these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending <em>Grutter</em> to the sort of classifications at issue here.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Despite the districts\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that they employed individual racial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends, the minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments suggests that other means would be effective.  Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools.  Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its use of racial classifications has had a minimal effect, and claims only that its guidelines provide a firm definition of the goal of racially integrated schools, thereby providing administrators with authority to collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the desired range.  Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents and the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.  In <em>Grutter</em>, in contrast, the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law school there at issue.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  While the Court does not suggest that <em>greater </em>use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts\xe2\x80\x99 racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using such classifications.  The districts have also failed to show they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.  Narrow tailoring requires \xe2\x80\x9cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plans\xe2\x80\x94many of which would not have used express racial classifications\xe2\x80\x94were rejected with little or no consideration.  Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9328. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0the Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded for additional reasons in Parts III\xe2\x80\x93B and IV that the plans at issue are unconstitutional under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9325, 28\xe2\x80\x9341. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Court need not resolve the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over whether racial diversity in schools has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits because it is clear that the racial classifications at issue are not narrowly tailored to the asserted goal.  In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.  They are tied to each district\xe2\x80\x99s specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits.  Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the required \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d number in each district.  The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective districts, or rather the districts\xe2\x80\x99 white/nonwhite or black/\xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d balance, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans.  In <em>Grutter</em>, the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful number\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335\xe2\x80\x93336, and the Court concluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant pool to arrive at that number, <em>id.,</em> at 335\xe2\x80\x93336.  Here, in contrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits.  This is a fatal flaw under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s existing precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Freeman, supra</em>, at 494.  Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify imposing racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated admonitions that this is unconstitutional.  While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promote\xe2\x80\x94racial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration\xe2\x80\x94they offer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial balancing.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9325. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts\xe2\x80\x99 own terms, the costs are undeniable.  Government action dividing people by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote \xe2\x80\x9cnotions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Croson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 493, \xe2\x80\x9creinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Reno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/630/index.html">509 U. S. 630</a>, 657, and \xe2\x80\x9cendorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/547/index.html">497 U. S. 547</a>, 603 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  When it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard.  In <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U. S. 483</a>, the Court held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted inferiority.  <em>Id.,</em> at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in that case.  <em>Id., </em>at 494.  The districts here invoke the ultimate goal of those who filed <em>Brown</em> and subsequent cases to support their argument, but the argument of the plaintiff in <em>Brown </em>was that the Equal Protection Clause \xe2\x80\x9cprevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race,\xe2\x80\x9d and that view prevailed\xe2\x80\x94this Court ruled in its remedial opinion that <em>Brown </em>required school districts \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools <em>on a nonracial basis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/294/index.html">349 U. S. 294</a>, 300\xe2\x80\x93301 (emphasis added).  Pp.\xc2\xa028\xe2\x80\x9341.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy agreed that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases and that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 student assignment plans are not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling goal of diversity properly defined, but concluded that some parts of the plurality opinion imply an unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when it may be taken into account.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are narrowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual student\xe2\x80\x99s race are made in a challenged program.  The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate when it concedes it denied Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s requested kindergarten transfer on the basis of his race under its guidelines, yet also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to kindergartners.  This discrepancy is not some simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the district\xe2\x80\x99s use of individual racial classifications.  As becomes clearer when the district\xe2\x80\x99s plan is further considered, Jefferson County has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  In its briefing it fails to make clear\xe2\x80\x94even in the limited respects implicated by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s initial assignment and transfer denial\xe2\x80\x94whether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and <em>ad\xc2\xa0hoc</em> manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.  When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the government.  In the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions based on individual racial classifications, but it has nevertheless failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with only a minority of the students classified as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite,\xe2\x80\x9d it has employed the crude racial categories of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-white\xe2\x80\x9d as the basis for its assignment decisions.  Far from being narrowly tailored, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the district has provided no convincing explanation for its design.  Pp.  2\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The plurality opinion is too dismissive of government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in ensuring that all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.  In administering public schools, it is permissible to consider the schools\xe2\x80\x99 racial makeup and adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition.  Cf. <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>.  School authorities concerned that their student bodies\xe2\x80\x99 racial compositions interfere with offering an equal educational opportunity to all are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion based solely on a systematic, individual typing by race.  Such measures may include strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of neighborhood demographics; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each respondent has failed to provide the necessary support for the proposition that there is no other way than individual racial classifications to avoid racial isolation in their school districts.  Cf. <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 501.  In these cases, the fact that the number of students whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is small suggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends through different means, including the facially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might include race as a component.  The latter approach would be informed by <em>Grutter</em>, though the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the students\xe2\x80\x99 age, the parents\xe2\x80\x99 needs, and the schools\xe2\x80\x99 role.

In Jefferson County, it is used to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests.  In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student\xe2\x80\x99s race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predetermined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole.  Parents of students denied assignment to particular schools under these plans solely because of their race brought suit, contending that allocating children to different public schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection.  The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans.  We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both cases present the same underlying legal question\xe2\x80\x94whether a public school that had not operated legally segregated schools or has been found to be unitary may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that classification in making school assignments.  Although we examine the plans under the same legal framework, the specifics of the two plans, and the circumstances\nsurrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite different. </p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public high schools.  In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this case for assigning students to these schools.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, pp. 90a\xe2\x80\x9392a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The plan allows incoming ninth graders to choose from among any of the district\xe2\x80\x99s high schools, ranking however many schools they wish in order of preference.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some schools are more popular than others.  If too many students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs a series of \xe2\x80\x9ctiebreakers\xe2\x80\x9d to determine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school.  The first tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school.  The next tiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the particular school and the race of the individual student.  In the district\xe2\x80\x99s public schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as nonwhite.  <em>Id.,</em> at 38a, 103a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  If an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage points of the district\xe2\x80\x99s overall white/nonwhite racial balance, it is what the district calls \xe2\x80\x9cintegration positive,\xe2\x80\x9d and the district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment students whose race \xe2\x80\x9cwill serve to bring the school into balance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 38a.  See <em>Parents Involved VII, </em>426 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162, 1169\xe2\x80\x931170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  If it is still necessary to select students for the school after using the racial tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the student\xe2\x80\x99s residence.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 38a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seattle has never operated segregated schools\xe2\x80\x94legally separate schools for students of different races\xe2\x80\x94nor has it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation.  It nonetheless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt to address the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on school assignments.  Most white students live in the northern part of Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the southern part.  <em>Parents Involved VII</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1166.  Four of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s high schools are located in the north\xe2\x80\x94Ballard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x94and five in the south\xe2\x80\x94Rainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin.  One school\xe2\x80\x94Garfield\xe2\x80\x94is more or less in the center of Seattle.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 38a\xe2\x80\x9339a, 45a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the 2000\xe2\x80\x932001 school year, five of these schools were oversubscribed\xe2\x80\x94Ballard, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt, Garfield, and Franklin\xe2\x80\x94so much so that 82 percent of incoming ninth graders ranked one of these schools as their first choice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 38a.  Three of the oversubscribed schools were \xe2\x80\x9cintegration positive\xe2\x80\x9d because the school\xe2\x80\x99s white enrollment the previous school year was greater than 51 percent\xe2\x80\x94Ballard, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt.  Thus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82, respectively) who selected one of these three schools as a top choice received placement at the school than would have been the case had race not been considered, and proximity been the next tiebreaker.  <em>Id.,</em> at 39a\xe2\x80\x9340a.  Franklin was \xe2\x80\x9cintegration positive\xe2\x80\x9d because its nonwhite enrollment the previous school year was greater than 69 percent; 89 more white students were assigned to Franklin by operation of the racial tiebreaker in the 2000\xe2\x80\x932001 school year than otherwise would have been.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Garfield was the only oversubscribed school whose composition during the 1999\xe2\x80\x932000 school year was within the racial guidelines, although in previous years Garfield\xe2\x80\x99s enrollment had been predominantly nonwhite, and the racial tiebreaker had been used to give preference to white students.  <em>Id.,</em> at 39a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools (Parents Involved) is a nonprofit corporation comprising the parents of children who have been or may be denied assignment to their chosen high school in the district because of their race.  The concerns of Parents Involved are illustrated by Jill Kurfirst, who sought to enroll her ninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard High School\xe2\x80\x99s special Biotechnology Career Academy.  Andy suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, but had made good progress with hands-on instruction, and his mother and middle school teachers thought that the smaller biotechnology program held the most promise for his continued success.  Andy was accepted into this selective program but, because of the racial tiebreaker, was denied assignment to Ballard High School.  <em>Id.,</em> at 143a\xe2\x80\x93146a, 152a\xe2\x80\x93160a.  Parents Involved commenced this suit in the Western District of Washington, alleging that Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s use of race in assignments violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and the Washington Civil Rights Act.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 28a\xe2\x80\x9335a. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment to the school district, finding that state law did not bar the district\xe2\x80\x99s use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  137 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1224, 1240 (WD Wash. 2001) (<em>Parents Involved I</em>).  The Ninth Circuit initially reversed based on its interpretation of the Washington Civil Rights Act, 285 F.\xc2\xa03d 1236, 1253 (2002) (<em>Parents Involved II</em>), and enjoined the district\xe2\x80\x99s use of the integration tiebreaker, <em>id.,</em> at 1257.  Upon realizing that the litigation would not be resolved in time for assignment decisions for the 2002\xe2\x80\x932003 school year, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion, 294 F.\xc2\xa03d 1084 (2002) (<em>Parents Involved III</em>), vacated the injunction, and, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa72.60.020 (2006), certified the state-law question to the Washington Supreme Court, 294 F.\xc2\xa03d 1085, 1087 (2002) (<em>Parents Involved IV</em>).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Washington Supreme Court determined that the State Civil Rights Act bars only preferential treatment programs \xe2\x80\x9cwhere race or gender is used by government to select a less qualified applicant over a more qualified applicant,\xe2\x80\x9d and not  \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rograms which are racially neutral, such as the [district\xe2\x80\x99s] open choice plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parents Involved in Community Schools</em> v. <em>Seattle School Dist., No. 1, </em>149 Wash. 2d 660, 689\xe2\x80\x93690, 663,<em> </em>72 P.\xc2\xa03d 151, 166, 153 (2003) (en banc) (<em>Parents Involved V</em>).

The panel determined that while achieving racial diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling government interests, <em>id.,</em> at 964, Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s use of the racial tiebreaker was not narrowly tailored to achieve these interests, <em>id.,</em> at 980.  The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc, 395 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168 (2005), and overruled the panel decision, affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, <em>Parents Involved VII</em>,<em> </em>426 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 1192\xe2\x80\x931193.

App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, p. 77.  Approximately 34 percent of the district\xe2\x80\x99s 97,000 students are black; most of the remaining 66 percent are white.  <em>McFarland</em> v. <em>Jefferson Cty.

The plan requires all nonmagnet schools to maintain a minimum black enrollment of 15 percent, and a maximum black enrollment of 50 percent.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 81; <em>McFarland I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 842.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the elementary school level, based on his or her address, each student is designated a \xe2\x80\x9cresides\xe2\x80\x9d school to which students within a specific geographic area are assigned; elementary resides schools are \xe2\x80\x9cgrouped into clusters in order to facilitate integration.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 82.  The district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents of kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district may submit an application indicating a first and second choice among the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit such an application are assigned within the cluster by the district.  \xe2\x80\x9cDecisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the schools and the racial guidelines in the District\xe2\x80\x99s current student assignment plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 38.  If a school has reached the \xe2\x80\x9cextremes of the racial guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d a student whose race would contribute to the school\xe2\x80\x99s racial imbalance will not be assigned there.  <em>Id.,</em> at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 82.  After assignment, students at all grade levels are permitted to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools in the district.  Transfers may be requested for any number of reasons, and may be denied because of lack of available space or on the basis of the racial guidelines.  <em>Id.,</em> at 43.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into the school district in August 2002, she sought to enroll her son, Joshua McDonald, in kindergarten for the 2002\xe2\x80\x932003 school year.  His resides school was only a mile from his new home, but it had no available space\xe2\x80\x94assignments had been made in May, and the class was full.  Jefferson County assigned Joshua to another elementary school in his cluster, Young Elementary.  This school was 10 miles from home, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a school in a different cluster, Bloom Elementary, which\xe2\x80\x94like his resides school\xe2\x80\x94was only a mile from home.  See Tr. in <em>McFarland I,</em> pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x9349 through 1\xe2\x80\x9354 (Dec. 8, 2003).  Space was available at Bloom, and intercluster transfers are allowed, but Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s transfer was nonetheless denied because, in the words of Jefferson County, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he transfer would have an adverse effect on desegregation compliance\xe2\x80\x9d of Young.

Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because none of its current members can claim an imminent injury.  Even if the district maintains the current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, Seattle argues, Parents Involved members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a Seattle public high school and choose an oversubscribed school that is integration positive\xe2\x80\x94too speculative a harm to maintain standing.

The group\xe2\x80\x99s members have children in the district\xe2\x80\x99s elementary, middle, and high schools, App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 299a\xe2\x80\x93301a; Affidavit of Kathleen Brose Pursuant to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Petitioner Parents Involved), and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of Parents Involved members whose elementary and middle school children may be \xe2\x80\x9cdenied admission to the high schools of their choice when they apply for those schools in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 30a.  The fact that it is possible that children of group members will not be denied admission to a school based on their race\xe2\x80\x94because they choose an undersubscribed school or an oversubscribed school in which their race is an advantage\xe2\x80\x94does not eliminate the injury claimed.  Moreover, Parents Involved also asserted an interest in not being \xe2\x80\x9cforced to compete for seats at certain high schools in a system that uses race as a deciding factor in many of its admissions decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As we have held, one form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause is being forced to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the plaintiff, <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U.

But the district vigorously defends the constitutionality of its race-based program, and nowhere suggests that if this litigation is resolved in its favor it will not resume using race to assign students.

In order to satisfy this searching standard of review, the school districts must demonstrate that the use of individual racial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d government interest.  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the interests a school district might assert, it suffices to note that our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classifications in the school context, have recognized two interests that qualify as compelling.  The first is the compelling interest of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination.  See <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>Pitts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/467/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/467/index.html">503 U. S. 467</a>, 494 (1992).  Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that they were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to court-ordered desegregation decrees.  The Jefferson County public schools were previously segregated by law and were subject to a desegregation decree entered in 1975.  In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree dissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had \xe2\x80\x9celiminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus had achieved \xe2\x80\x9cunitary\xe2\x80\x9d status.  <em>Hampton</em>, 102 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 360.  Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an interest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination in defending its present use of race in assigning students.

The specific interest found compelling in <em>Grutter</em> was student body diversity \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of higher education.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The diversity interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed \xe2\x80\x9call factors that may contribute to student body diversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 337.  We described the various types of diversity that the law school sought:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[The law school\xe2\x80\x99s] policy makes clear there are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 338 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court quoted the articulation of diversity from Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Regents of the University of California </em>v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978), noting that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grutter</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 324\xe2\x80\x93325 (citing and quoting <em>Bakke</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 314\xe2\x80\x93315 (opinion of Powell, J.); brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, what was upheld in <em>Grutter</em> was consideration of \xe2\x80\x9ca far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U.

The classification of applicants by race upheld in <em>Grutter</em> was only as part of a \xe2\x80\x9chighly individualized, holistic review,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 U. S., at 337.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the <em>Grutter</em> Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court explained would be \xe2\x80\x9cpatently unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve \xe2\x80\x9cexposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone.  The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in <em>Grutter</em>; it is <em>the</em> factor.  Like the University of Michigan undergraduate plan struck down in <em>Gratz</em>, 539 U. S., at 275, the plans here \xe2\x80\x9cdo not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants\xe2\x80\x9d but instead rely on racial classifications in a \xe2\x80\x9cnonindividualized, mechanical\xe2\x80\x9d way.  <em>Id.,</em> at 276, 280 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/\xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d terms in Jefferson County.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  But see <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/547/index.html">497 U.

The Seattle \xe2\x80\x9cBoard Statement Reaffirming Diversity Rationale\xe2\x80\x9d speaks of the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent educational value\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roviding students the opportunity to attend schools with diverse student enrollment,\xe2\x80\x9d App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 128a, 129a.  But under the Seattle plan, a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not.  It is hard to understand how a plan that could allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98broadly diverse,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Grutter, supra</em>, at 329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to <em>Grutter</em>, the courts of appeals rejected as unconstitutional attempts to implement race-based assignment plans\xe2\x80\x94such as the plans at issue here\xe2\x80\x94in primary and secondary schools.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Eisenberg</em> v. <em>Montgomery Cty. Public Schools</em>, 197 F.\xc2\xa03d 123, 133 (CA4 1999); <em>Tuttle</em> v. <em>Arlington Cty.

See also <em>Ho</em> v. <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist.</em>, 147 F.\xc2\xa03d 854, 865 (CA9 1998).  After <em>Grutter</em>, however, the two Courts of Appeals in these cases, and one other, found that race-based assignments were permissible at the elementary and secondary level, largely in reliance on that case.  See <em>Parents Involved VII</em>, 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1166; <em>McFarland II</em>, 416 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 514; <em>Comfort</em> v. <em>Lynn School Comm.</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 13 (CA1 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In upholding the admissions plan in <em>Grutter</em>, though, this Court relied upon considerations unique to institutions of higher education, noting that in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 329.  See also <em>Bakke</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 312, 313 (opinion of Powell, J.).  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters\xe2\x80\x9d in applying strict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was addressing the use of race \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of higher education.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 327, 328, 334.  The Court in <em>Grutter</em> expressly articulated key limitations on its holding\xe2\x80\x94defining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher education\xe2\x80\x94but these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending <em>Grutter</em> to uphold race-based assignments in elementary and secondary schools.  The present cases are not governed by <em>Grutter</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps recognizing that reliance on <em>Grutter</em> cannot sustain their plans, both school districts assert additional interests, distinct from the interest upheld in <em>Grutter</em>, to justify their race-based assignments.  In briefing and argument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use of race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools and to ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do not prevent nonwhite students from having access to the most desirable schools.  Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at\xc2\xa019.  Jefferson County has articulated a similar goal, phrasing its interest in terms of educating its students \xe2\x80\x9cin a racially integrated environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 22.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Each school district argues that educational and broader socialization benefits flow from a racially diverse learning environment, and each contends that because the diversity they seek is racial diversity\xe2\x80\x94not the broader diversity at issue in <em>Grutter</em>\xe2\x80\x94it makes sense to promote that interest directly by relying on race alone.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties and their <em>amici</em> dispute whether racial diversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits.  The debate is not one we need to resolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classifications employed by the districts are not narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits asserted to flow from racial diversity.  In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plans are tied to each district\xe2\x80\x99s specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits.  In Seattle, the district seeks white enrollment of between 31 and 51 percent (within 10 percent of \xe2\x80\x9cthe district white average\xe2\x80\x9d of 41 percent), and nonwhite enrollment of between 49 and 69 percent (within 10 percent of \xe2\x80\x9cthe district minority average\xe2\x80\x9d of 59 percent).  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 103a.  In Jefferson County, by contrast, the district seeks black enrollment of no less than 15 or more than 50 percent, a range designed to be \xe2\x80\x9cequally above and below Black student enrollment systemwide,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McFarland\xc2\xa0I</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 842, based on the objective of achieving at \xe2\x80\x9call schools \xe2\x80\xa6 an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment\xe2\x80\x9d of 34 percent.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 81.  In Seattle, then, the benefits of racial diversity require enrollment of at least 31 percent white students; in Jefferson County, at least 50 percent.  There must be at least 15 percent nonwhite students under Jefferson County\xe2\x80\x99s plan; in Seattle, more than three times that figure.  This comparison makes clear that the racial demographics in each district\xe2\x80\x94whatever they happen to be\xe2\x80\x94drive the required \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d numbers.  The plans here are not tailored to achieving a degree of diversity necessary to realize the asserted educational benefits; instead the plans are tailored, in the words of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Manager of Enrollment Planning, Technical Support, and Demographics, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe goal established by the school board of attain-ing a level of diversity within the schools that approximates the district\xe2\x80\x99s overall demographics.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 42a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective school districts\xe2\x80\x94or rather the white/nonwhite or black/\xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d balance of the districts, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans.  Indeed, in its brief Seattle simply assumes that the educational benefits track the racial breakdown of the district.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cFor Seattle, \xe2\x80\x98racial balance\xe2\x80\x99 is clearly not an end in itself but rather a measure of the extent to which the educational goals the plan was designed to foster are likely to be achieved\xe2\x80\x9d).  When asked for \xe2\x80\x9ca range of percentage that would be diverse,\xe2\x80\x9d however, Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s expert said it was important to have \xe2\x80\x9csufficient numbers so as to avoid students feeling any kind of specter of exceptionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 276a.  The district did not attempt to defend the proposition that anything outside its range posed the \xe2\x80\x9cspecter of exceptionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor did it demonstrate in any way how the educational and social benefits of racial diversity or avoidance of racial isolation are more likely to be achieved at a school that is 50 percent white and 50 percent Asian-American, which would qualify as diverse under Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan, than at a school that is 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white, which under Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s definition would be racially concentrated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, Jefferson County\xe2\x80\x99s expert referred to the importance of having \xe2\x80\x9cat least 20 percent\xe2\x80\x9d minority group representation for the group \xe2\x80\x9cto be visible enough to make a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that \xe2\x80\x9csmall isolated minority groups in a school are not likely to have a strong effect on the overall school.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 159, 147.  The Jefferson County plan, however, is based on a goal of replicating at each school \xe2\x80\x9can African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 81.  Joshua McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s requested transfer was denied because his race was listed as \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d rather than black, and allowing the transfer would have had an adverse effect on the racial guideline compliance of Young Elementary, the school he sought to leave.  <em>Id.,</em> at 21.  At the time, however, Young Elementary was 46.8 percent black.  <em>Id.</em>, at 73.  The transfer might have had an adverse effect on the effort to approach district-wide racial proportionality at Young, but it had nothing to do with preventing either the black or \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d group from becoming \xe2\x80\x9csmall\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cisolated\xe2\x80\x9d at Young.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, in each case the extreme measure of relying on race in assignments is unnecessary to achieve the stated goals, even as defined by the districts.  For example, at Franklin High School in Seattle, the racial tiebreaker was applied because nonwhite enrollment exceeded 69 percent, and resulted in an incoming ninth-grade class in 2000\xe2\x80\x932001 that was 30.3 percent Asian-American, 21.9 percent African-American, 6.8 percent Latino, 0.5 percent Native-American, and 40.5 percent Caucasian.  Without the racial tiebreaker, the class would have been 39.6 percent Asian-American, 30.2 percent African-American, 8.3 percent Latino, 1.1 percent Native-American, and 20.8 percent Caucasian.  See App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 308a.  When the actual racial breakdown is considered, enrolling students without regard to their race yields a substantially diverse student body under any definition of diversity.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Grutter</em>, the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful number\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body.  539 U.

Even in the context of mandatory desegregation, we have stressed that racial proportionality is not required, see <em>Milliken,</em> 433 U. S., at 280, n. 14 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A desegregation] order contemplating the substantive constitutional right [to a] particular degree of racial balance or mixing is \xe2\x80\xa6 infirm as a matter of law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/402/1/index.html">402 U.

For the foregoing reasons, this conclusory argument cannot sustain the plans.  However closely related race-based assignments may be to achieving racial balance, that itself cannot be the goal, whether labeled \xe2\x80\x9cracial diversity\xe2\x80\x9d or anything else.  To the extent the objective is sufficient diversity so that students see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using means that treat students solely as members of a racial group is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The districts assert, as they must, that the way in which they have employed individual racial classifications is necessary to achieve their stated ends.  The minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments, however, suggests that other means would be effective.  Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools.  Approximately 307 student assignments were affected by the racial tiebreaker in 2000\xe2\x80\x932001; the district was able to track the enrollment status of 293 of these students.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 162a.  Of these, 209 were assigned to a school that was one of their choices, 87 of whom were assigned to the same school to which they would have been assigned without the racial tiebreaker.  Eighty-four students were assigned to schools that they did not list as a choice, but 29 of those students would have been assigned to their respective school without the racial tiebreaker, and 3 were able to attend one of the oversubscribed schools due to waitlist and capacity adjustments.  <em>Id.,</em> at 162a\xe2\x80\x93163a.  In over one-third of the assignments affected by the racial tiebreaker, then, the use of race in the end made no difference, and the district could identify only 52 students who were ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker in that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not listed as a preference and to which they would not otherwise have been assigned.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the panel majority in <em>Parents Involved VI</em> concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he tiebreaker\xe2\x80\x99s annual effect is thus merely to shuffle a few handfuls of different minority students between a few schools\xe2\x80\x94about a dozen additional Latinos into Ballard, a dozen black students into Nathan Hale, perhaps two dozen Asians into Roosevelt, and so on.  The District has not met its burden of proving these marginal changes \xe2\x80\xa6 outweigh the cost of subjecting hundreds of students to disparate treatment based solely upon the color of their skin.\xe2\x80\x9d  377 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 984\xe2\x80\x93985 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, Jefferson County\xe2\x80\x99s use of racial classifications has only a minimal effect on the assignment of students.  Elementary school students are assigned to their first- or second-choice school 95 percent of the time, and transfers, which account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are only denied 35 percent of the time\xe2\x80\x94and presumably an even smaller percentage are denied on the basis of the racial guidelines, given that other factors may lead to a denial.  <em>McFarland I</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 844\xe2\x80\x93845, nn. 16, 18.

As Jefferson County explains, \xe2\x80\x9cthe racial guidelines have minimal impact in this process, because they \xe2\x80\x98mostly influence student assignment in subtle and indirect ways.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While we do not suggest that <em>greater </em>use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts\xe2\x80\x99 racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications.  In <em>Grutter</em>, the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law school\xe2\x80\x94from 4 to 14.5 percent.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  Here the most Jefferson County itself claims is that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the guidelines provide a firm definition of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s goal of racially integrated schools, they \xe2\x80\x98provide administrators with the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the 15\xe2\x80\x9350% range.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 7 (quoting <em>McFarland I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 842).  Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents and our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The districts have also failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.  Narrow tailoring requires \xe2\x80\x9cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Grutter, supra</em>, at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plans\xe2\x80\x94many of which would not have used express racial classifications\xe2\x80\x94were rejected with little or no consideration.

Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications.

Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable precedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary holdings, alters and misapplies our well-established legal framework for assessing equal protection challenges to express racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, Justice Breyer seeks to justify the plans at issue under our precedents recognizing the compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination.  See <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9324.  Not even the school districts go this far, and for good reason.  The distinction between segregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by other factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this area for generations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Milliken</em>, 433 U. S., at 280, n.\xc2\xa014; <em>Freeman</em>, 503 U. S., at 495\xe2\x80\x93496 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere resegregation is a product not of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent elides this distinction between <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation, casually intimates that Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s school attendance patterns reflect illegal segregation, <em>post</em>, at 5, 18, 23,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and fails to credit the judicial determination\xe2\x80\x94under the most rigorous standard\xe2\x80\x94that Jefferson County had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation.  The dissent thus alters in fundamental ways not only the facts presented here but the established law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>McDaniel</em> v. <em>Barresi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/39/index.html">402 U. S. 39</a> (1971), <em>post</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 29\xe2\x80\x9330, highlights how far removed the discussion in the dissent is from the question actually presented in these cases.  <em>McDaniel</em> concerned a Georgia school system that had been segregated by law.  There was no doubt that the county had operated a \xe2\x80\x9cdual school system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McDaniel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 41, and no one questions that the obligation to disestablish a school system segregated by law can include race-conscious remedies\xe2\x80\x94whether or not a court had issued an order to that effect.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  The present cases are before us, however, because the Seattle school district was never segregated by law, and the Jefferson County district has been found to be unitary, having eliminated the vestiges of its prior dual status.  The justification for race-conscious remedies in <em>McDaniel</em> is therefore not applicable here.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s persistent refusal to accept this distinction\xe2\x80\x94its insistence on viewing the racial classifications here as if they were just like the ones in <em>McDaniel</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cdevised to overcome a history of segregated public schools,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x94explains its inability to understand why the remedial justification for racial classifications cannot decide these cases.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent next relies heavily on dicta from <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, 402 U. S., at 16\xe2\x80\x94far more heavily than the school districts themselves.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 3, 22\xe2\x80\x9328, with Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320; Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 31.  The dissent acknowledges that the two-sentence discussion in <em>Swann</em> was pure dicta, <em>post</em>, at 22, but nonetheless asserts that it demonstrates a \xe2\x80\x9cbasic principle of constitutional law\xe2\x80\x9d that provides \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative legal guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 22, 30.  Initially, as the Court explained just last Term, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Central Va. Community College</em> v. <em>Katz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/356/index.html">546 U. S. 356</a>, 363 (2006).  That is particularly true given that, when <em>Swann</em> was decided, this Court had not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications like those before us.  See n.\xc2\xa016, <em>infra</em>.  There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretical,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 30, about our approach to such dicta.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 399\xe2\x80\x93400 (1821) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (explaining why dicta is not binding).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer would not only put such extraordinary weight on admitted dicta, but relies on the statement for something it does not remotely say.  <em>Swann</em> addresses only a possible state objective; it says nothing of the permissible <em>means</em>\xe2\x80\x94race conscious or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that a school district might employ to achieve that objective.  The reason for this omission is clear enough, since the case did not involve any voluntary means adopted by a school district.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Swann</em> as recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals\xe2\x80\x9d is\xe2\x80\x94at best\xe2\x80\x94a dubious inference.  <em>Post</em>, at 22.  Even if the dicta from <em>Swann</em> were entitled to the weight the dissent would give it, and no dicta is, it not only did not address the question presented in <em>Swann</em>, it also does not address the question presented in these cases\xe2\x80\x94whether the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 use of racial classifications to achieve their stated goals is permissible.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, for all the lower court cases Justice Breyer cites as evidence of the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing legal assumption\xe2\x80\x9d embodied by <em>Swann</em>, very few are pertinent.  Most are not.  For example, the dissent features <em>Tometz</em> v. <em>Board of Ed., Waukegan City School Dist. No. 61</em>, 39 Ill. 2d 593, 596\xe2\x80\x93598, 237 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 498, 500\xe2\x80\x93502 (1968), an Illinois decision, as evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cstate and federal courts had considered the matter settled and uncontroversial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 25.  But <em>Tometz</em> addressed a challenge to a statute requiring race-consciousness in drawing school attendance boundaries\xe2\x80\x94an issue well beyond the scope of the question presented in these cases.  Importantly, it considered that issue only under rational-basis review, 39 Ill. 2d, at 600, 237 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 502 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe test of any legislative classification essentially is one of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d), which even the dissent grudgingly recognizes is an improper standard for evaluating express racial classifications.  Other cases cited are similarly inapplicable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Citizens for Better Ed.</em> v. <em>Goose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist.</em>, 719 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 350, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (Tex. App. 1986) (upholding rezoning plan under rational-basis review).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent next looks for authority to a footnote in <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/457/index.html">458 U. S. 457</a>, 472, n.\xc2\xa015 (1982), <em>post</em>, at 56\xe2\x80\x9357, but there this Court expressly noted that it was <em>not</em> passing on the propriety of race-conscious student assignments in the absence of a finding of <em>de jure</em> segregation.  Similarly, the citation of <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/527/index.html">458 U. S. 527</a> (1982), <em>post</em>, at 24, in which a state referendum prohibiting a race-based assignment plan was challenged, is inapposite\xe2\x80\x94in <em>Crawford</em> the Court again expressly reserved the question presented by these cases.  458 U. S.<em>,</em> at 535, n.\xc2\xa011.  Such reservations and preliminary analyses of course did not decide the merits of this question\xe2\x80\x94as evidenced by the disagreement among the lower courts on this issue.  Compare <em>Eisenberg</em>, 197 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 133, with <em>Comfort</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent also asserts that these cases are controlled by <em>Grutter,</em> claiming that the existence of a compelling interest in these cases \xe2\x80\x9cfollows <em>a fortiori</em>\xe2\x80\x9d from <em>Grutter, post,</em> at 41, 64\xe2\x80\x9366, and accusing us of tacitly overruling that case, see <em>post,</em> at 64\xe2\x80\x9366.  The dissent overreads <em>Grutter,</em> however, in suggesting that it renders pure racial balancing a constitutionally compelling interest; <em>Grutter</em> itself recognized that using race simply to achieve racial balance would be \xe2\x80\x9cpatently unconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 U. S.<em>,</em> at 330.  The Court was exceedingly careful in describing the interest furthered in <em>Grutter</em> as \xe2\x80\x9cnot an interest in simple ethnic diversity\xe2\x80\x9d but rather a \xe2\x80\x9cfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d in which race was but a single element.  539 U. S., at 324\xe2\x80\x93325 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We take the <em>Grutter</em> Court at its word.  We simply do not understand how Justice Breyer can maintain that classifying every schoolchild as black or white, and using that classification as a determinative factor in assigning children to achieve pure racial balance, can be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cless burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d than the consideration of race in <em>Grutter</em>, <em>post,</em> at 47, when the Court in <em>Grutter</em> stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he importance of \xe2\x80\xa6 individualized consideration\xe2\x80\x9d in the program was \xe2\x80\x9cparamount,\xe2\x80\x9d and consideration of race was one factor in a \xe2\x80\x9chighly individualized, holistic review.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 337.  Certainly if the constitutionality of the stark use of race in these cases were as established as the dissent would have it, there would have been no need for the extensive analysis undertaken in <em>Grutter</em>.  In light of the foregoing, Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to <em>stare decisis</em> rings particularly hollow.  See <em>post,</em> at 65\xe2\x80\x9366.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time it relies on inapplicable desegregation cases, misstatements of admitted dicta, and other noncontrolling pronouncements, Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent candidly dismisses the significance of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated <em>holdings</em> that all racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny, see <em>post</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9333, 35\xe2\x80\x9336, arguing that a different standard of review should be applied because the districts use race for beneficent rather than malicious purposes, see <em>post</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has recently reiterated, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>all</em> racial classifications [imposed by government] \xe2\x80\xa6 must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, 543 U.

Justice Breyer nonetheless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school districts, stating that he has found \xe2\x80\x9cno case that \xe2\x80\xa6 repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <em>exclude </em>and that which seeks to <em>include </em>members of minority races.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 29 (emphasis in original).

See <em>post</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.

(Fourteenth Amendment creates rights \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed to the individual.  The rights established are personal rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  This fundamental principle goes back, in this context, to <em>Brown</em> itself.  See <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/294/index.html">349 U.

For the dissent, in contrast, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98individualized scrutiny\xe2\x80\x99 is simply beside the point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 55.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s position comes down to a familiar claim: The end justifies the means.  He admits that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a cost in applying \xe2\x80\x98a state-mandated racial label,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 67, but he is confident that the cost is worth paying.  Our established strict scrutiny test for racial classifications, however, insists on \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed examination, both as to ends <em>and</em> as to means.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 236 (emphasis added).  Simply because the school districts may seek a worthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on the basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifications should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite his argument that these cases should be evaluated under a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of review that is not \xe2\x80\x98strict\xe2\x80\x99 in the traditional sense of that word,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 36, Justice Breyer still purports to apply strict scrutiny to these cases.  See <em>post</em>, at 37.  It is evident, however, that Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s brand of narrow tailoring is quite unlike anything found in our precedents.  Without any detailed discussion of the operation of the plans, the students who are affected, or the districts\xe2\x80\x99 failure to consider race-neutral alternatives, the dissent concludes that the districts have shown that these racial classifications are necessary to achieve the districts\xe2\x80\x99 stated goals.  This conclusion is divorced from any evaluation of the actual impact of the plans at issue in these cases\xe2\x80\x94other than to note that the plans \xe2\x80\x9coften have no effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 46.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Instead, the dissent suggests that some combination of the development of these plans over time, the difficulty of the endeavor, and the good faith of the districts suffices to demonstrate that these stark and controlling racial classifications are constitutional.  The Constitution and our precedents require more. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not apply, Justice Breyer repeatedly urges deference to local school boards on these issues.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 21, 48\xe2\x80\x9349, 66.  Such deference \xe2\x80\x9cis fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence.

These other means\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, where to construct new schools, how to allocate resources among schools, and which academic offerings to provide to attract students to certain schools\xe2\x80\x94implicate different considerations than the explicit racial classifications at issue in these cases, and we express no opinion on their validity\xe2\x80\x94not even in dicta.  Rather, we employ the familiar and well-established analytic approach of strict scrutiny to evaluate the plans at issue today, an approach that in no way warrants the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s cataclysmic concerns.  Under that approach, the school districts have not carried their burden of showing that the ends they seek justify the particular extreme means they have chosen\xe2\x80\x94classifying individual students on the basis of their race and discriminating among them on that basis.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts\xe2\x80\x99 own terms, the costs are undeniable.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U.

S. 495</a>, 517 (2000), \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All this is true enough in the contexts in which these statements were made\xe2\x80\x94government contracting, voting districts, allocation of broadcast licenses, and electing state officers\xe2\x80\x94but when it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard.  In <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U. S. 483</a> (1954) (<em>Brown I</em>), we held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because government classification and separation on grounds of race themselves denoted inferiority.  <em>Id.,</em> at 493\xe2\x80\x93494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954.  See <em>id.,</em> at 494 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The impact [of segregation] is greater when it has the sanction of the law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The next Term, we accordingly stated that \xe2\x80\x9cfull compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with <em>Brown I</em> required school districts \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools <em>on a nonracial basis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown II,</em> 349 U.

What do the racial classifications at issue here do, if not accord differential treatment on the basis of race?  As counsel who appeared before this Court for the plaintiffs in <em>Brown</em> put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have one fundamental contention which we will seek to develop in the course of this argument, and that contention is that no State has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Brown I</em>, p. 7 (Robert L. Carter, Dec. 9, 1952).  There is no ambiguity in that statement.  And it was that position that prevailed in this Court, which emphasized in its remedial opinion that what was \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable <em>on a nondiscriminatory basis</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and what was required was \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining admission to the public schools <em>on</em> <em>a nonracial basis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 300\xe2\x80\x93301 (emphasis added).  What do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not determine admission to a public school on a racial basis?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before <em>Brown</em>, schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin.  The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again\xe2\x80\x94even for very different reasons.  For schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brown II</em>, 349 U.

Even if this purported distinction, which Justice Stevens would adopt, <em>post</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa03 (dissenting opinion), had not been already rejected by this Court, the distinction has no relevance to these cases, in which students of all races are excluded from the schools they wish to attend based solely on the racial classifications.

Nothing in the opinion approves use of racial classifications as the means to address the imbalance.  The suggestion that our decision today is somehow inconsistent with our disposition of that appeal is belied by the fact that neither the lower courts, the respondent school districts, nor any of their 51 <em>amici</em> saw fit even to cite the case.  We raise this fact not to argue that the dismissal should be afforded any different <em>stare decisis</em> effect, but rather simply to suggest that perhaps\xe2\x80\x94for the reasons noted above\xe2\x80\x94the dismissal does not mean what Justice Stevens believes it does.</p>\n<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer also tries to downplay the impact of the racial assignments by stating that in Seattle \xe2\x80\x9cstudents can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 46.

I wholly concur in The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I write separately to address several of the contentions in Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent (hereinafter the dissent).  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, resegregation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these school boards have no present interest in remedying past segregation; and these race-based student-assignment programs do not serve any compelling state interest.  Accordingly, the plans are unconstitutional.  Disfavoring a color-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent would give school boards a free hand to make decisions on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x94an approach reminiscent of that advocated by the segregationists in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U. S.483 (1954).  This approach is just as wrong today as it was a half-century ago.  The Constitution and our cases require us to be much more demanding before permitting local school boards to make decisions based on race.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent repeatedly claims that the school districts are threatened with resegregation and that they will succumb to that threat if these plans are declared unconstitutional.  It also argues that these plans can be justified as part of the school boards\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to \xe2\x80\x9ceradicat[e] earlier school segregation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 4.  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric, neither of these school districts is threatened with resegregation, and neither is constitutionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based remediation.  Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the mere incantation of terms like resegregation and remediation cannot make up the difference.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because this Court has authorized and required race-based remedial measures to address <em>de jure</em> segregation, it is important to define segregation clearly and to distinguish it from racial imbalance.  In the context of public schooling, segregation is the deliberate operation of a school system to \xe2\x80\x9ccarry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html">402 U.

Racial imbalance is not segregation.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Although presently observed racial imbalance might result from past <em>de jure</em> segregation, racial imbalance can also result from any number of innocent private decisions, including voluntary housing choices.

No one contends that Seattle has established or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school system that separates students on the basis of race.  The statistics cited in Appendix A to the dissent are not to the contrary.  See <em>post</em>, at 69\xe2\x80\x9372.  At most, those statistics show a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance.  However, racial imbalance without intentional state action to separate the races does not amount to segregation.  To raise the specter of resegregation to defend these programs is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature of the cases before us.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as the school districts lack an interest in preventing resegregation, they also have no present interest in remedying past segregation.  The Constitution generally prohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this Court has authorized the use of race-based measures for remedial purposes in two narrowly defined circumstances.  First, in schools that were formerly segregated by law, race-based measures are sometimes constitutionally compelled to remedy prior school segregation.  Second, in <em>Croson</em>, the Court appeared willing to authorize a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible.  <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 504 (1989).  Without explicitly resting on either of these strands of doctrine, the dissent repeatedly invokes the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 supposed interests in remedying past segregation.  Properly analyzed, though, these plans do not fall within either existing category of permissible race-based remediation.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution does not permit race-based government decisionmaking simply because a school district claims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with arguably pure motives.  <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 371 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 239 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).  Rather, race-based government decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 326; see also Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>infra</em>.  This exacting scrutiny \xe2\x80\x9chas proven automatically fatal\xe2\x80\x9d in most cases.  <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 121 (Thomas, J., concurring); cf. <em>Hirabayashi</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/320/81/index.html">320 U. S. 81</a>, 100 (1943) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]acial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d).  And appropriately so.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 353 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Therefore, as a general rule, all race-based government decisionmaking\xe2\x80\x94regardless of context\xe2\x80\x94is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has carved out a narrow exception to that general rule for cases in which a school district has a \xe2\x80\x9chistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system deliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>Swann</em>, 402 U.

Seattle has no history of <em>de jure</em> segregation; therefore, the Constitution did not require Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Although Louisville once operated a segregated school system and was subject to a Federal District Court\xe2\x80\x99s desegregation decree, see <em>ante</em>, at 7; <em>Hampton</em> v. <em>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</em> 102 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 358, 376\xe2\x80\x93377 (WD Ky. 2000), that decree was dissolved in 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 360.  Since then, no race-based remedial measures have been required in Louisville.  Thus, the race-based student-assignment plan at issue here, which was instituted the year after the dissolution of the desegregation decree, was not even arguably required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aside from constitutionally compelled remediation in schools, this Court has permitted government units to remedy prior racial discrimination only in narrow circumstances.  See <em>Wygant</em> v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion).  Regardless of the constitutional validity of such remediation, see <em>Croson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 524\xe2\x80\x93525 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), it does not apply here.  Again, neither school board asserts that its race-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimination.  Seattle provides three forward-looking\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to remedial\xe2\x80\x94justifications for its race-based assignment plan.  Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9334.  Louisville asserts several similar forward-looking interests, Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9329, and at oral argument, counsel for Louisville disavowed any claim that Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\x9cdepend[ed] in any way on the prior de jure segregation,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, p.\xc2\xa038.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, for a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible, the Court has required it to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 500 (quoting <em>Wygant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 277 (plurality opinion)).  Establishing a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d requires proper findings regarding the extent of the government unit\xe2\x80\x99s past racial discrimination.  <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 504.  The findings should \xe2\x80\x9cdefine the scope of any injury [and] the necessary remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 505, and must be more than \xe2\x80\x9cinherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 506.  Assertions of general societal discrimination are plainly insufficient.  <em>Id.,</em> at 499, 504; <em>Wygant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 274 (plurality opinion); cf. <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a>, 310 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).  Neither school district has made any such specific findings.  For Seattle, the dissent attempts to make up for this failing by adverting to allegations made in past complaints filed against the Seattle school district.  However, allegations in complaints cannot substitute for specific findings of prior discrimination\xe2\x80\x94even when those allegations lead to settlements with complaining parties.  Cf. <em>Croson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505; <em>Wygant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 279, n.\xc2\xa05 (plurality opinion).  As for Louisville, its slate was cleared by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 dissolution decree, which effectively declared that there were no longer any effects of <em>de jure </em>discrimination in need of remediation.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s repeated intimation of a remedial purpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as a permissible race-based remedial measure.  Thus, the programs are subject to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the foregoing demonstrates, racial balancing is sometimes a constitutionally permissible remedy for the discrete legal wrong of <em>de jure</em> segregation, and when directed to that end, racial balancing is an exception to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.  Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates the concepts of segregation and racial imbalance:  If racial imbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be constitutionally acceptable to use racial balancing to remedy racial imbalance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For at least two reasons, however, it is wrong to place the remediation of segregation on the same plane as the remediation of racial imbalance.  First, as demonstrated above, the two concepts are distinct.  Although racial imbalance can result from <em>de jure</em> segregation, it does not necessarily, and the further we get from the era of state-sponsored racial separation, the less likely it is that racial imbalance has a traceable connection to any prior segregation.  See <em>Freeman</em>, 503 U. S., at 496; <em>Jenkins</em>, 515 U. S., at 118 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, a school cannot \xe2\x80\x9cremedy\xe2\x80\x9d racial imbalance in the same way that it can remedy segregation.  Remediation of past <em>de jure</em> segregation is a one-time process involving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted by an identified entity.  At some point, the discrete injury will be remedied, and the school district will be declared unitary.  See <em>Swann</em>, 402 U. S., at 31.  Unlike <em>de jure</em> segregation, there is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance.  Individual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural course, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a school district\xe2\x80\x99s changing demographics.  Thus, racial balancing will have to take place on an indefinite basis\xe2\x80\x94a continuous process with no identifiable culpable party and no discernable end point.  In part for those reasons, the Court has never permitted outright racial balancing solely for the purpose of achieving a particular racial balance.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lacking a cognizable interest in remediation, neither of these plans can survive strict scrutiny because neither plan serves a genuinely compelling state interest.  The dissent avoids reaching that conclusion by unquestioningly accepting the assertions of selected social scientists while completely ignoring the fact that those assertions are the subject of fervent debate.  Ultimately, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s entire analysis is corrupted by the considerations that lead it initially to question whether strict scrutiny should apply at all.  What emerges is a version of \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d that combines hollow assurances of harmlessness with reflexive acceptance of conventional wisdom.  When it comes to government race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution demands more.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent claims that \xe2\x80\x9cthe law requires application here of a standard of review that is not \xe2\x80\x98strict\xe2\x80\x99 in the traditional sense of that word.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 36.  This view is informed by dissents in our previous cases and the concurrences of two Court of Appeals judges.  <em>Post, </em>at 34\xe2\x80\x9336 (citing 426 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162, 1193\xe2\x80\x931194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring); <em>Comfort</em> v. <em>Lynn School Comm.,</em> 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring)).  Those lower court judges reasoned that programs like these are not \xe2\x80\x9caimed at oppressing blacks\xe2\x80\x9d and do not \xe2\x80\x9cseek to give one racial group an edge over another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Comfort</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 27 (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring); 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1193 (Kozinski, J., concurring).  They were further persuaded that these plans differed from other race-based programs this Court has considered because they are \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly more benign than laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or create quotas for or against a racial group,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Comfort</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 28 (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring), and they are \xe2\x80\x9cfar from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amendment was addressed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 29; 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1195 (Kozinski, J., concurring).  Instead of strict scrutiny, Judge Kozinski would have analyzed the plans under \xe2\x80\x9crobust and realistic rational basis review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1194.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These arguments are inimical to the Constitution and to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We have made it unusually clear that strict scrutiny applies to <em>every</em> racial classification.  <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U.

The constitutional problems with government race-based decisionmaking are not diminished in the slightest by the presence or absence of an intent to oppress any race or by the real or asserted well-meaning motives for the race-based decisionmaking.  <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U. S., at 228\xe2\x80\x93229.  Purportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the same constitutional infirmity as invidious race-based decisionmaking.  <em>Id.,</em> at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government\xe2\x80\x99s racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even supposing it mattered to the constitutional analysis, the race-based student assignment programs before us are not as benign as the dissent believes.  See <em>post</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]acial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 241 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  As these programs demonstrate, every time the government uses racial criteria to \xe2\x80\x9cbring the races together,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 29, someone gets excluded, and the person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his or her race.  The petitioner in the Louisville case received a letter from the school board informing her that her <em>kindergartener</em> would not be allowed to attend the school of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s choosing because of the child\xe2\x80\x99s race.  App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, p.\xc2\xa097.  Doubtless, hundreds of letters like this went out from both school boards every year these race-based assignment plans were in operation.  This type of exclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely the sort of government action that pits the races against one another, exacerbates racial tension, and \xe2\x80\x9cprovoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 241 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Accordingly, these plans are simply one more variation on the government race-based decisionmaking we have consistently held must be subjected to strict scrutiny.  <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 326.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the dissent admits to discomfort in applying strict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to have nonetheless applied that exacting standard.  But in its search for a compelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the most tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans, grouping them all under the term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98integration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>post</em>, at 37.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]ntegration,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we are told, has \xe2\x80\x9cthree essential elements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  None of these elements is compelling.

For the reasons explained above, the records in these cases do not demonstrate that either school board\xe2\x80\x99s plan is supported by an interest in remedying past discrimination.

General claims that past school segregation affected such varied societal trends are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wygant</em>, 476 U.

Consequently, school boards seeking to remedy those societal problems with race-based measures in schools today would have no way to gauge the proper scope of the remedy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 498.

The dissent asserts that racially balanced schools improve educational outcomes for black children.  In support, the dissent unquestioningly cites certain social science research to support propositions that are hotly disputed among social scientists.  In reality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing has any educational benefits, much less that integration is necessary to black achievement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Scholars have differing opinions as to whether educational benefits arise from racial balancing.  Some have concluded that black students receive genuine educational benefits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Crain &amp; Mahard, Desegregation and Black Achievement: A Review of the Research, 42 L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 17, 48 (1978).  Others have been more circumspect.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider, Uribe, &amp; Verdugo, High Quality Schooling for African American Students, in Beyond Desegregation 166 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps desegregation does not have a single effect, positive or negative, on the academic achievement of African American students, but rather some strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no difference whatsoever.  It is clear to us that focusing simply on demographic issues detracts from focusing on improving schools\xe2\x80\x9d).  And some have concluded that there are no demonstrable educational benefits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom eds. 2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>amicus</em> briefs in the cases before us mirror this divergence of opinion.  Supporting the school boards, one <em>amicus </em>has assured us that \xe2\x80\x9cboth early desegregation research and recent statistical and econometric analyses \xe2\x80\xa6 indicate that there are positive effects on minority student achievement scores arising from diverse school settings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American Educational Research Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10.  Another brief claims that \xe2\x80\x9cschool desegregation has a modest positive impact on the achievement of African-American students.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief for 553 Social Scientists as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (footnote omitted).  Yet neither of those briefs contains specific details like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects or the precise demographic mix at which those positive effects begin to be realized.  Indeed, the social scientists\xe2\x80\x99 brief rather cautiously claims the existence of any benefit at all, describing the \xe2\x80\x9cpositive impact\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cmodest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 13, acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthere appears to be little or no effect on math scores,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 14, and admitting that the \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying reasons for these gains in achievement are not entirely clear,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 15.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other <em>amici </em>dispute these findings.  One <em>amicus</em> reports that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n study after study, racial composition of a student body, when isolated, proves to be an insignificant determinant of student achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Dr. John Murphy et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, p.\xc2\xa08; see also <em>id.</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no evidence that diversity in the K\xe2\x80\x9312 classroom positively affects student achievement\xe2\x80\x9d).

Armor et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Add to the inconclusive social science the fact of black achievement in \xe2\x80\x9cracially isolated\xe2\x80\x9d environments.  See T. Sowell, Education: Assumptions Versus History 7\xe2\x80\x9338 (1986).  Before <em>Brown</em>, the most prominent example of an exemplary black school was Dunbar High School.  <em>Id.,</em> at 29 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the period 1918\xe2\x80\x931923, Dunbar graduates earned fifteen degrees from Ivy League colleges, and ten degrees from Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan\xe2\x80\x9d).  Dunbar is by no means an isolated example.  See <em>id.,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9332 (discussing other successful black schools); Walker, Can Institutions Care? Evidence from the Segregated Schooling of African American Children, in Beyond Desegregation 209\xe2\x80\x93226 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996); see also T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study 141\xe2\x80\x93165 (2004).  Even after <em>Brown</em>, some schools with predominantly black enrollments have achieved outstanding educational results.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21 High-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49\xe2\x80\x9350, 53\xe2\x80\x9356, 71\xe2\x80\x9373, 81\xe2\x80\x9384, 87\xe2\x80\x9388 (2001); A. Thernstrom &amp; S.

Izumi, They Have Overcome: High-Poverty, High-Performing Schools in California (2002) (chronicling exemplary achievement in predominantly Hispanic schools in California).  There is also evidence that black students attending historically black colleges achieve better academic results than those attending predominantly white colleges.  <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing sources); see also <em>Fordice</em>, 505 U.

Seattle operates a K\xe2\x80\x938 \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican-American Academy,\xe2\x80\x9d which has a \xe2\x80\x9cnonwhite\xe2\x80\x9d enrollment of 99%.

That school was founded in 1990 as part of the school board\xe2\x80\x99s effort to \xe2\x80\x9cincrease academic achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  See African American Academy History, online at http://www.\nseattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  According to the school\xe2\x80\x99s most recent annual report, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]cademic excellence\xe2\x80\x9d is its \xe2\x80\x9cprimary goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  See African American Academy 2006 Annual Report, p.\xc2\xa02, online at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/\nsiso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf.  This racially imbalanced environment has reportedly produced test scores \xe2\x80\x9chigher across all grade levels in reading, writing and math.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Contrary to what the dissent would have predicted, see <em>post</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, the children in Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s African American Academy have shown gains when placed in a \xe2\x80\x9chighly segregated\xe2\x80\x9d environment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this tenuous relationship between forced racial mixing and improved educational results for black children, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educational element supports the integration interest, let alone makes it compelling.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  See <em>Jenkins</em>, 515 U. S., at 121\xe2\x80\x93122 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps recognizing as much, the dissent argues that the social science evidence is \xe2\x80\x9cstrong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 38.  This assertion is inexplicable.  It is not up to the school boards\xe2\x80\x94the very government entities whose race-based practices we must strictly scrutinize\xe2\x80\x94to determine what interests qualify as compelling under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   Rather, this Court must assess independently the nature of the interest asserted and the evidence to support it in order to determine whether it qualifies as compelling under our precedents.  In making such a determination, we have deferred to state authorities only once, see <em>Grutter</em>, 539 U. S., at 328\xe2\x80\x93330, and that deference was prompted by factors uniquely relevant to higher education.  <em>Id.,</em> at 328 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university\xe2\x80\x99s academic decisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test\xe2\x80\x94whether sufficient social science evidence supports a government unit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the interest it asserts is compelling\xe2\x80\x94calls to mind the rational-basis standard of review the dissent purports not to apply, <em>post</em>, at 36-37.  See <em>Williamson</em> v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/483/index.html">348 U.

Furthermore, it would leave our equal-protection jurisprudence at the mercy of elected government officials evaluating the evanescent views of a handful of social scientists.  To adopt the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s deferential approach would be to abdicate our constitutional responsibilities.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dissent asserts a \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic element\xe2\x80\x9d to the integration interest.  It defines the \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic element\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the \xe2\x80\x98pluralistic society\xe2\x80\x99 in which our children will live.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 39.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Environmental reflection, though, is just another way to say racial balancing.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bakke</em>, 438 U.

S., at 494.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Navigating around that inconvenient authority, the dissent argues that the racial balancing in these plans is not an end in itself but is instead intended to \xe2\x80\x9cteac[h] children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  These \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric lessons in socialization and good citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d are too sweeping to qualify as compelling interests.  <em>Grutter</em>, 539 U. S., at 348 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And they are not \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely relevant\xe2\x80\x9d to schools or \xe2\x80\x9cuniquely \xe2\x80\x98teachable\xe2\x80\x99 in a formal educational setting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 347.  Therefore, if governments may constitutionally use racial balancing to achieve these aspirational ends in schools, they may use racial balancing to achieve similar goals at every level\xe2\x80\x94from state-sponsored 4\xe2\x80\x93H clubs, see <em>Bazemore</em> v. <em>Friday</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html">478 U. S. 385</a>, 388\xe2\x80\x93390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the state civil service.  See <em>Grutter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/347/index.html">539 U. S. 347</a>\xe2\x80\x93348 (opinion of Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the democratic interest has no durational limit, contrary to <em>Grutter</em>\xe2\x80\x99s command.  See <em>id.,</em> at 342; see also <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 498; <em>Wygant</em>, 476 U. S., at 275 (plurality opinion).  In other words, it will always be important for students to learn cooperation among the races.  If this interest justifies race-conscious measures today, then logically it will justify race-conscious measures forever.  Thus, the democratic interest, limitless in scope and \xe2\x80\x9ctimeless in [its] ability to affect the future,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 276 (plurality opinion), cannot justify government race-based decisionmaking.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to these defects, the democratic element of the integration interest fails on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s own terms.  The dissent again relies upon social science research to support the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing teaches children to accept cooperation and improves racial attitudes and race relations.  Here again, though, the dissent overstates the data that supposedly support the interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent points to data that indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cblack and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).  By the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s account, improvements in racial attitudes depend upon the increased contact between black and white students thought to occur in more racially balanced schools.  There is no guarantee, however, that students of different races in the same school will actually spend time with one another.  Schools frequently group students by academic ability as an aid to efficient instruction, but such groupings often result in classrooms with high concentrations of one race or another.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Yonezawa, Wells, &amp; Serna, Choosing Tracks: \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of Choice\xe2\x80\x9d in Detracting Schools, 39 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 1, p.\xc2\xa038 (Spring 2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann: First- and Second-Generation Segregation in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 38 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 2, pp. 233\xe2\x80\x93234 (Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in Charlotte, North Carolina).  In addition to classroom separation, students of different races within the same school may separate themselves socially.  See Hallinan &amp; Williams, Interracial Friendship Choices in Secondary Schools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev., No. 1, pp. 72\xe2\x80\x9376 (Feb. 1989); see also Clotfelter, Interracial Contact in High School Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev., No. 1, pp. 41\xe2\x80\x9343 (Mar. 2002).  Therefore, even supposing interracial contact leads directly to improvements in racial attitudes and race relations, a program that assigns students of different races to the same schools might not capture those benefits.  Simply putting students together under the same roof does not necessarily mean that the students will learn together or even interact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, it is unclear whether increased interracial contact improves racial attitudes and relations.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  One researcher has stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe reviews of desegregation and intergroup relations were unable to come to any conclusion about what the probable effects of desegregation were \xe2\x80\xa6 [;] virtually all of the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions about the impact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A Review of the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991).  Some studies have even found that a deterioration in racial attitudes seems to result from racial mixing in schools.  See N. St. John, School Desegregation Outcomes for Children 67\xe2\x80\x9368 (1975) (\xe2\x80\x9cA glance at [the data] shows that for either race positive findings are less common than negative findings\xe2\x80\x9d); Stephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An Evaluation 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social Psychology 183\xe2\x80\x93186 (M. Saks &amp; L. Saxe eds. 1986).  Therefore, it is not nearly as apparent as the dissent suggests that increased interracial exposure automatically leads to improved racial attitudes or race relations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given our case law and the paucity of evidence supporting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s belief that these plans improve race relations, no democratic element can support the integration interest.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent attempts to buttress the integration interest by claiming that it follows <em>a fortiori</em> from the interest this Court recognized as compelling in <em>Grutter</em>.  <em>Post</em>, at 41.  Regardless of the merit of <em>Grutter</em>, the compelling interest recognized in that case cannot support these plans.  <em>Grutter</em> recognized a compelling interest in a law school\xe2\x80\x99s attainment of a diverse student body.  539 U. S., at 328.  This interest was critically dependent upon features unique to higher education: \xe2\x80\x9cthe expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial niche in our constitutional tradition\xe2\x80\x9d occupied by universities, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education[,] includ[ing] the selection of its student body.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted).  None of these features is present in elementary and secondary schools.  Those schools do not select their own students, and education in the elementary and secondary environment generally does not involve the free interchange of ideas thought to be an integral part of higher education.  See 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1208 (Bea, J., dissenting).  Extending <em>Grutter</em> to this context would require us to cut that holding loose from its theoretical moorings.  Thus, only by ignoring <em>Grutter</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning can the dissent claim that recognizing a compelling interest in these cases is an <em>a fortiori</em> application of <em>Grutter</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stripped of the baseless and novel interests the dissent asserts on their behalf, the school boards cannot plausibly maintain that their plans further a compelling interest.  As I explained in <em>Grutter</em>, only \xe2\x80\x9cthose measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy \xe2\x80\xa6 or to prevent violence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca government\xe2\x80\x99s effort to remedy past discrimination for which it is responsible\xe2\x80\x9d constitute compelling interests.   539 U. S., at 351\xe2\x80\x93352, 353.  Neither of the parties has argued\xe2\x80\x94nor could they\xe2\x80\x94that race-based student assignment is necessary to provide a bulwark against anarchy or to prevent violence.  And as I explained above, the school districts have no remedial interest in pursuing these programs.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, the school boards cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.  These plans are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms of today\xe2\x80\x99s result can be traced to its rejection of the color-blind Constitution.  See <em>post</em>, at 29.  The dissent attempts to marginalize the notion of a color-blind Constitution by consigning it to me and Members of today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  See <em>ibid.;</em> see also <em>post,</em> at 61.

Such a view was ascendant in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence for several decades.  It first appeared in <em>Plessy,</em> where the Court asked whether a state law providing for segregated railway cars was \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  163 U. S., at 550.  The Court deferred to local authorities in making its determination, noting that in inquiring into reasonableness \xe2\x80\x9cthere must necessarily be a large discretion on the part of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court likewise paid heed to societal practices, local expectations, and practical consequences by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe established usages, customs and traditions of the people, and with a view to the promotion of their comfort, and the preservation of the public peace and good order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Guided by these principles, the Court concluded: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires the separation of the two races in public conveyances is unreasonable, or more obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment than the acts of Congress requiring separate schools for colored children in the District of Columbia.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 550\xe2\x80\x93551.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The segregationists in <em>Brown</em> embraced the arguments the Court endorsed in <em>Plessy</em>.  Though <em>Brown</em> decisively rejected those arguments, today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent replicates them to a distressing extent.  Thus, the dissent argues that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 47.  Similarly, the segregationists made repeated appeals to societal practice and expectation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <em>Briggs</em> v. <em>Elliott</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1953, No. 2, p. 76 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] State has power to establish a school system which is capable of efficient administration, taking into account local problems and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The dissent argues that \xe2\x80\x9cweight [must be given] to a local school board\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, expertise, and concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 48, and with equal vigor, the segregationists argued for deference to local authorities.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Kansas on Reargument in <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1953, No. 1, p.\xc2\xa014 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe advocate only a concept of constitutional law that permits determinations of state and local policy to be made on state and local levels.  We defend only the validity of the statute that enables the Topeka Board of Education to determine its own course\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The dissent argues that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cthreatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2, and claims that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9crisks serious harm to the law and for the Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 65.  The segregationists also relied upon the likely practical consequences of ending the state-imposed system of racial separation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <em>Davis</em> v. <em>County School Board</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1953, No. 3, p.\xc2\xa037 (\xe2\x80\x9cYet a holding that school segregation by race violates the Constitution will result in upheaval in all of those places not now subject to Federal judicial scrutiny.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <em>Briggs</em> v. <em>Elliott</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1953, No. 2, p. 59 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be difficult indeed to find a case so favored by precedent as is the case for South Carolina here\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The similarities between the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s arguments and the segregationists\xe2\x80\x99 arguments do not stop there.  Like the dissent, the segregationists repeatedly cautioned the Court to consider practicalities and not to embrace too theoretical a view of the Fourteenth Amendment.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  And just as the dissent argues that the need for these programs will lessen over time, the segregationists claimed that reliance on segregation was lessening and might eventually end.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What was wrong in 1954 cannot be right today.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Whatever else the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the segregationists\xe2\x80\x99 arguments in <em>Brown</em> might have established, it certainly made clear that state and local governments cannot take from the Constitution a right to make decisions on the basis of race by adverse possession.  The fact that state and local governments had been discriminating on the basis of race for a long time was irrelevant to the <em>Brown</em> Court.  The fact that racial discrimination was preferable to the relevant communities was irrelevant to the <em>Brown</em> Court.  And the fact that the state and local governments had relied on statements in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions was irrelevant to the <em>Brown</em> Court.  The same principles guide today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  None of the considerations trumpeted by the dissent is relevant to the constitutionality of the school boards\xe2\x80\x99 race-based plans because no contextual detail\xe2\x80\x94or collection of contextual details, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x9322\xe2\x80\x94can \xe2\x80\x9cprovide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U.

Although no such distinction is apparent in the Fourteenth Amendment, the dissent would constitutionalize today\xe2\x80\x99s faddish social theories that embrace that distinction.  The Constitution is not that malleable.  Even if current social theories favor classroom racial engineering as necessary to \xe2\x80\x9csolve the problems at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 21, the Constitution enshrines principles independent of social theories.  See <em>Plessy</em>, 163 U. S., at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country.  And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power.  So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. \xe2\x80\xa6 Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dred Scott</em> v. <em>Sandford</em>, 19 How. 393, 407 (1857) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hey [members of the \xe2\x80\x9cnegro African race\xe2\x80\x9d] had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\xe2\x80\x9d).  Can we really be sure that the racial theories that motivated <em>Dred Scott</em> and <em>Plessy</em> are a relic of the past or that future theories will be nothing but beneficent and progressive?

For the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, the relevant hard-won gains are the present racial compositions in the individual schools in Seattle and Louisville.  However, the actual hard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of the system of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in Louisville.  To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix in several schools with the elimination of the system of systematic <em>de jure</em> segregation trivializes the latter accomplishment.  Nothing but an interest in classroom aesthetics and a hypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justifies the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 racial balancing programs.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d required the disestablishment of <em>de jure</em> segregation.

In these cases two school districts in different parts of the country seek to teach that principle by having classrooms that reflect the racial makeup of the surrounding community.  That the school districts consider these plans to be necessary should remind us our highest aspirations are yet unfulfilled.  But the solutions mandated by these school districts must themselves be lawful.  To make race matter now so that it might not matter later may entrench the very prejudices we seek to overcome.  In my view the state-mandated racial classifications at issue, official labels proclaiming the race of all persons in a broad class of citizens\xe2\x80\x94elementary school students in one case, high school students in another\xe2\x80\x94are unconstitutional as the cases now come to us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with The Chief Justice that we have jurisdiction to decide the cases before us and join Parts I and II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I also join Parts III\xe2\x80\x93A and III\xe2\x80\x93C for reasons provided below.  My views do not allow me to join the balance of the opinion by The Chief Justice, which seems to me to be inconsistent in both its approach and its implications with the history, meaning, and reach of the Equal Protection Clause.  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion, on the other hand, rests on what in my respectful submission is a misuse and mistaken interpretation of our precedents.  This leads it to advance propositions that, in my view, are both erroneous and in fundamental conflict with basic equal protection principles.  As a consequence, this separate opinion is necessary to set forth my conclusions in the two cases before the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opinion of the Court and Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion (hereinafter dissent) describe in detail the history of integration efforts in Louisville and Seattle.  These plans classify individuals by race and allocate benefits and burdens on that basis; and as a result, they are to be subjected to strict scrutiny.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/499/index.html">543 U. S. 499</a>, 505\xe2\x80\x93506 (2005); <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The dissent finds that the school districts have identified a compelling interest in increasing diversity, including for the purpose of avoiding racial isolation.  See <em>post</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9345.  The plurality, by contrast, does not acknowledge that the school districts have identified a compelling interest here.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9325.  For this reason, among others, I do not join Parts III\xe2\x80\x93B and IV.  Diversity, depending on its meaning and definition, is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is well established that when a governmental policy is subjected to strict scrutiny, \xe2\x80\x9cthe government has the burden of proving that racial classifications \xe2\x80\x98are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505 (quoting <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 227 (1995)).  \xe2\x80\x9cAbsent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are \xe2\x80\x98benign\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98remedial\xe2\x80\x99 and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion).  And the inquiry into less restrictive alternatives demanded by the narrow tailoring analysis requires in many cases a thorough understanding of how a plan works.  The government bears the burden of justifying its use of individual racial classifications.  As part of that burden it must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual student\xe2\x80\x99s race are made in a challenged governmental program.  The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Crystal Meredith challenges the district\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deny her son Joshua McDonald a requested transfer for his kindergarten enrollment.

To the contrary, Jefferson County in its briefing has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  See, <em>e.g</em>., Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 4\xe2\x80\x9310.  While it acknowledges that racial classifications are used to make certain assignment decisions, it fails to make clear, for example, who makes the decisions; what if any oversight is employed; the precise circumstances in which an assignment decision will or will not be made on the basis of race; or how it is determined which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision.

Compare, <em>e.g</em>., App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 37 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach [Jefferson County] school \xe2\x80\xa6 has a designated geographic attendance area, which is called the \xe2\x80\x98resides area\xe2\x80\x99 of the school[, and each] such school is the \xe2\x80\x98resides school\xe2\x80\x99 for those students whose parent\xe2\x80\x99s or guardian\xe2\x80\x99s residence address is within the school\xe2\x80\x99s geographic attendance area\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 82 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll elementary students \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be assigned to the school which serves the area in which they reside\xe2\x80\x9d); and Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no selection criteria for admission to [an elementary school student\xe2\x80\x99s] resides school, except attainment of the appropriate age and completion of the previous grade\xe2\x80\x9d), with App. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93915, at 38 (\xe2\x80\x9cDecisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the [elementary] schools and the racial guidelines in the District\xe2\x80\x99s current student assignment plan\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 82 (acknowledging that a student may not be assigned to his or her resides school if it \xe2\x80\x9chas reached \xe2\x80\xa6 the extremes of the racial guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can attempt to identify a construction of Jefferson County\xe2\x80\x99s student assignment plan that, at least as a logical matter, complies with these competing propositions; but this does not remedy the underlying problem.  Jefferson County fails to make clear to this Court\xe2\x80\x94even in the limited respects implicated by Joshua\xe2\x80\x99s initial assignment and transfer denial\xe2\x80\x94whether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and <em>ad\xc2\xa0hoc</em> manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.  When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions on the basis of individual racial classifications.  See, <em>e.g</em>., Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, p. 5\xe2\x80\x9311.  The district, nevertheless, has failed to make an adequate showing in at least one respect.  It has failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with fewer than half of the students classified as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite,\xe2\x80\x9d it has employed the crude racial categories of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-white\xe2\x80\x9d as the basis for its assignment decisions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id</em>., at 1\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The district has identified its purposes as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) to promote the educational benefits of diverse school enrollments; (2) to reduce the potentially harmful effects of racial isolation by allowing students the opportunity to opt out of racially isolated schools; and (3) to make sure that racially segregated housing patterns did not prevent non-white students from having equitable access to the most popular over-subscribed schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 19.  Yet the school district does not explain how, in the context of its diverse student population, a blunt distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-white\xe2\x80\x9d furthers these goals.  As the Court explains, \xe2\x80\x9ca school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Far from being narrowly tailored to its purposes, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the school district has provided no convincing explanation for its design.  Other problems are evident in Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s system, but there is no need to address them now.  As the district fails to account for the classification system it has chosen, despite what appears to be its ill fit, Seattle has not shown its plan to be narrowly tailored\nto achieve its own ends; and thus it fails to pass strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our Nation from the inception has sought to preserve and expand the promise of liberty and equality on which it was founded.  Today we enjoy a society that is remarkable in its openness and opportunity.  Yet our tradition is to go beyond present achievements, however significant, and to recognize and confront the flaws and injustices that remain.  This is especially true when we seek assurance that opportunity is not denied on account of race.  The enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is by way of preface to my respectful submission that parts of the opinion by The Chief Justice imply an all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when, in my view, it may be taken into account.  The plurality opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate interest government has in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s postulate that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341, is not sufficient to decide these cases.  Fifty years of experience since <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U. S. 483</a> (1954), should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution.  School districts can seek to reach <em>Brown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s objective of equal educational opportunity.  The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of <em>de facto</em> resegregation in schooling.  I cannot endorse that conclusion.  To the extent the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly mistaken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statement by Justice Harlan that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur Constitution is color-blind\xe2\x80\x9d was most certainly justified in the context of his dissent in <em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/163/537/index.html">163 U. S. 537</a>, 559 (1896).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in that case was a grievous error it took far too long to overrule.  <em>Plessy</em>, of course, concerned official classification by race applicable to all persons who sought to use railway carriages.  And, as an aspiration, Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s axiom must command our assent.  In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a universal constitutional principle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition.  Cf. <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a> (2003); <em>id.</em>, at 387\xe2\x80\x93388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  If school authorities are concerned that the student-body compositions of certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an equal educational opportunity to all of their students, they are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0School boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.  These mechanisms are race conscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would demand strict scrutiny to be found permissible.  See <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a>, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cStrict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Electoral district lines are \xe2\x80\x98facially race neutral\xe2\x80\x99 so a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable in redistricting cases than in cases of \xe2\x80\x98classifications based explicitly on race\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U. S., at 213)).  Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races.  Assigning to each student a personal designation according to a crude system of individual racial classifications is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis changes accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each respondent has asserted that its assignment of individual students by race is permissible because there is no other way to avoid racial isolation in the school districts.  Yet, as explained, each has failed to provide the support necessary for that proposition.  Cf. <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 501 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis\xe2\x80\x9d).  And individual racial classifications employed in this manner may be considered legitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compelling interest.  See <em>id.</em>, at 519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the cases before us it is noteworthy that the number of students whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is limited.  I join Part III\xe2\x80\x93C of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion because I agree that in the context of these plans, the small number of assignments affected suggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends through different means.  These include the facially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might include race as a component.  The latter approach would be informed by <em>Grutter</em>, though of course the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the age of the students, the needs of the parents, and the role of the schools.  </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent rests on the assumptions that these sweeping race-based classifications of persons are permitted by existing precedents; that its confident endorsement of race categories for each child in a large segment of the community presents no danger to individual freedom in other, prospective realms of governmental regulation; and that the racial classifications used here cause no hurt or anger of the type the Constitution prevents.  Each of these premises is, in my respectful view, incorrect.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents to justify the explicit, sweeping, classwide racial classifications at issue here is a misreading of our authorities that, it appears to me, tends to undermine well-accepted principles needed to guard our freedom.  And in his critique of that analysis, I am in many respects in agreement with The Chief Justice.  The conclusions he has set forth in Part III\xe2\x80\x93A of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion are correct, in my view, because the compelling interests implicated in the cases before us are distinct from the interests the Court has recognized in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and in increasing diversity in higher education.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  As the Court notes, we recognized the compelling nature of the interest in remedying past intentional discrimination in <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>Pitts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/467/index.html">503 U. S. 467</a>, 494 (1992), and of the interest in diversity in higher education in <em>Grutter</em>.  At the same time, these compelling interests, in my view, do help inform the present inquiry.  And to the extent the plurality opinion can be interpreted to foreclose consideration of these interests, I disagree with that reasoning.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the dissent, the general conclusions upon which it relies have no principled limit and would result in the broad acceptance of governmental racial classifications in areas far afield from schooling.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s permissive strict scrutiny (which bears more than a passing resemblance to rational-basis review) could invite widespread governmental deployment of racial classifications.  There is every reason to think that, if the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s rationale were accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper exercise of its spending authority or commerce power, could mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County plans nationwide.  There seems to be no principled rule, moreover, to limit the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s rationale to the context of public schools.  The dissent emphasizes local control, see <em>post</em>, at 48\xe2\x80\x9349, the unique history of school desegregation, see <em>post</em>, at 2, and the fact that these plans make less use of race than prior plans, see <em>post</em>, at 57, but these factors seem more rhetorical than integral to the analytical structure of the opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This brings us to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in <em>Gratz</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/244/index.html">539 U. S. 244</a> (2003), and <em>Grutter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a><em>.</em>  If today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent said it was adhering to the views expressed in the separate opinions in <em>Gratz</em> and <em>Grutter</em>, see <em>Gratz</em>, 539 U. S., at 281 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id.,</em> at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id.,</em> at 291 (Souter, J., dissenting); <em>id.,</em> at 298 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>Grutter</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 344 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), that would be understandable, and likely within the tradition\xe2\x80\x94to be invoked, in my view, in rare instances\xe2\x80\x94that permits us to maintain our own positions in the face of <em>stare decisis</em> when fundamental points of doctrine are at stake.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/743/index.html">535 U. S. 743</a>, 770 (2002) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  To say, however, that we must ratify the racial classifications here at issue based on the majority opinions in <em>Gratz</em> and <em>Grutter</em> is, with all respect, simply baffling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gratz</em> involved a system where race was not the entire classification.  The procedures in <em>Gratz </em>placed much less reliance on race than do the plans at issue here.  The issue in <em>Gratz </em>arose, moreover, in the context of college admissions where students had other choices and precedent supported the proposition that First Amendment interests give universities particular latitude in defining diversity.  See <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a>, 312\xe2\x80\x93314 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).  Even so the race factor was found to be invalid.  <em>Gratz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 251.  If <em>Gratz </em>is to be the measure, the racial classification systems here are <em>a fortiori</em> invalid.  If the dissent were to say that college cases are simply not applicable to public school systems in kindergarten through high school, this would seem to me wrong, but at least an arguable distinction.  Under no fair reading, though, can the majority opinion in <em>Gratz</em> be cited as authority to sustain the racial classifications under consideration here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same must be said for the controlling opinion in <em>Grutter</em>.  There the Court sustained a system that, it found, was flexible enough to take into account \xe2\x80\x9call pertinent elements of diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted), and considered race as only one factor among many, <em>id</em>., at 340.  Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan, by contrast, relies upon a mechanical formula that has denied hundreds of students their preferred schools on the basis of three rigid criteria: placement of siblings, distance from schools, and race.  If those students were considered for a whole range of their talents and school needs with race as just one consideration, <em>Grutter</em> would have some application.  That, though, is not the case.  The only support today\xe2\x80\x99s dissent can draw from <em>Grutter</em> must be found in its various separate opinions, not in the opinion filed for the Court.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush aside two concepts of central importance for determining the validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the hurt and adverse consequences resulting from race discrimination.  The first is the difference between <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation; the second, the presumptive invalidity of a State\xe2\x80\x99s use of racial classifications to differentiate its treatment of individuals.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the immediate aftermath of <em>Brown</em> the Court addressed other instances where laws and practices enforced <em>de jure</em> segregation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Loving</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/index.html">388 U. S. 1</a> (1967) (marriage); <em>New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn.</em> v. <em>Detiege</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/54/index.html">358 U. S. 54</a> (1958) <em>(per curiam)</em> (public parks); <em>Gayle</em> v. <em>Browder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/903/index.html">352 U. S. 903</a> (1956) <em>(per curiam)</em> (buses); <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Atlanta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/879/index.html">350 U. S. 879</a> (1955) <em>(per curiam)</em> (golf courses); <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em> v. <em>Dawson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/877/index.html">350 U. S. 877</a> (1955) <em>(per curiam)</em> (beaches).  But with reference to schools, the effect of the legal wrong proved most difficult to correct.  To remedy the wrong, school districts that had been segregated by law had no choice, whether under court supervision or pursuant to voluntary desegregation efforts, but to resort to extraordinary measures including individual student and teacher assignment to schools based on race.  See, <em>e.g., Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html">402 U. S. 1</a>, 8\xe2\x80\x9310 (1971); see also <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that racial classifications \xe2\x80\x9cmay be the only adequate remedy after a judicial determination that a State or its instrumentality has violated the Equal Protection Clause\xe2\x80\x9d).  So it was, as the dissent observes, see <em>post</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, that Louisville classified children by race in its school assignment and busing plan in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases recognized a fundamental difference between those school districts that had engaged in <em>de jure</em> segregation and those whose segregation was the result of other factors.  School districts that had engaged in <em>de jure</em> segregation had an affirmative constitutional duty to desegregate; those that were <em>de facto</em> segregated did not.  Compare <em>Green</em> v. <em>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/430/index.html">391 U. S. 430</a>, 437\xe2\x80\x93438 (1968), with <em>Milliken</em> v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/717/index.html">418 U. S. 717</a>, 745 (1974).  The distinctions between <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation extended to the remedies available to governmental units in addition to the courts.  For example, in <em>Wygant</em> v. <em>Jackson Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 274 (1986), the plurality noted: \xe2\x80\x9cThis Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification.  Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Croson, supra</em>, reinforced the difference between the remedies available to redress <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure </em>discrimination:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo accept [a] claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for \xe2\x80\x98remedial relief\xe2\x80\x99 for every disadvantaged group.  The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 505\xe2\x80\x93506.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the standpoint of the victim, it is true, an injury stemming from racial prejudice can hurt as much when the demeaning treatment based on race identity stems from bias masked deep within the social order as when it is imposed by law.  The distinction between government and private action, furthermore, can be amorphous both as a historical matter and as a matter of present-day finding of fact.  Laws arise from a culture and vice versa.  Neither can assign to the other all responsibility for persisting injustices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet, like so many other legal categories that can overlap in some instances, the constitutional distinction between <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation has been thought to be an important one.  It must be conceded its primary function in school cases was to delimit the powers of the Judiciary in the fashioning of remedies.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Milliken, supra, </em>at 746.  The distinction ought not to be altogether disregarded, however, when we come to that most sensitive of all racial issues, an attempt by the government to treat whole classes of persons differently based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s systematic classification of each individual by race.  There, too, the distinction serves as a limit on the exercise of a power that reaches to the very verge of constitutional authority.  Reduction of an individual to an assigned racial identity for differential treatment is among the most pernicious actions our government can undertake.  The allocation of governmental burdens and benefits, contentious under any circumstances, is even more divisive when allocations are made on the basis of individual racial classifications.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978); <em>Adarand</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding these concerns, allocation of benefits and burdens through individual racial classifications was found sometimes permissible in the context of remedies for <em>de jure </em>wrong.  Where there has been <em>de jure</em> segregation, there is a cognizable legal wrong, and the courts and legislatures have broad power to remedy it.  The remedy, though, was limited in time and limited to the wrong.  The Court has allowed school districts to remedy their prior <em>de jure</em> segregation by classifying individual students based on their race.  See <em>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Swann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/43/index.html">402 U. S. 43</a>, 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (1971).  The limitation of this power to instances where there has been <em>de jure </em>segregation serves to confine the nature, extent, and duration of governmental reliance on individual racial classifications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases here were argued upon the assumption, and come to us on the premise, that the discrimination in question did not result from <em>de jure</em> actions.  And when <em>de facto</em> discrimination is at issue our tradition has been that the remedial rules are different.  The State must seek alternatives to the classification and differential treatment of individuals by race, at least absent some extraordinary showing not present here.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent refers to an opinion filed by Judge Kozinski in one of the cases now before us, and that opinion relied upon an opinion filed by Chief Judge Boudin in a case presenting an issue similar to the one here.  See <em>post</em>, at 35 (citing 426 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162, 1193\xe2\x80\x931196 (CA9 2005) (concurring opinion) (citing <em>Comfort</em> v. <em>Lynn School Comm.</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 27\xe2\x80\x9329 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring))).  Though this may oversimplify the matter a bit, one of the main concerns underlying those opinions was this: If it is legitimate for school authorities to work to avoid racial isolation in their schools, must they do so only by indirection and general policies?  Does the Constitution mandate this inefficient result?  Why may the authorities not recognize the problem in candid fashion and solve it altogether through resort to direct assignments based on student racial classifications?  So, the argument proceeds, if race is the problem, then perhaps race is the solution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument ignores the dangers presented by individual classifications, dangers that are not as pressing when the same ends are achieved by more indirect means.  When the government classifies an individual by race, it must first define what it means to be of a race.  Who exactly is white and who is nonwhite?  To be forced to live under a state-mandated racial label is inconsistent with the dignity of individuals in our society.  And it is a label that an individual is powerless to change.  Governmental classifications that command people to march in different directions based on racial typologies can cause a new divisiveness.  The practice can lead to corrosive discourse, where race serves not as an element of our diverse heritage but instead as a bargaining chip in the political process.  On the other hand race-conscious measures that do not rely on differential treatment based on individual classifications present these problems to a lesser degree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The idea that if race is the problem, race is the instrument with which to solve it cannot be accepted as an analytical leap forward.  And if this is a frustrating duality of the Equal Protection Clause it simply reflects the duality of our history and our attempts to promote freedom in a world that sometimes seems set against it.  Under our Constitution the individual, child or adult, can find his own identity, can define her own persona, without state intervention that classifies on the basis of his race or the color of her skin.  </p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children.  A compelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an interest that a school district, in its discretion and expertise, may choose to pursue.  Likewise, a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population.  Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered.  What the government is not permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not made here, is to classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of them to schools based on that classification.  Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce children to racial chits valued and traded according to one school\xe2\x80\x99s supply and another\xe2\x80\x99s demand.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That statement, to be sure, invites this response: A sense of stigma may already become the fate of those separated out by circumstances beyond their immediate control.  But to this the replication must be:  Even so, measures other than differential treatment based on racial typing of individuals first must be exhausted.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision today should not prevent school districts from continuing the important work of bringing together students of different racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.  Due to a variety of factors\xe2\x80\x94some influenced by government, some not\xe2\x80\x94neighborhoods in our communities do not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole.  Those entrusted with directing our public schools can bring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, administrators, and other concerned citizens to find a way to achieve the compelling interests they face without resorting to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and burdens on the basis of racial classifications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this explanation I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962440">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nPARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS V.SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

The school board plans before us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools throughout the Nation.  All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated education that <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html"></a><a href="/us/347/483/index.html"></a><a href="/us/347/483/index.html">347 U.

As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong conclusion.  In doing so, it distorts precedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation, and it undermines <em>Brown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality.

And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward pub-lic school integration.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school districts previously segregated by law what they must do at a minimum to comply with <em>Brown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>constitutional holding.  The measures required by those cases often included race-conscious practices, such as mandatory busing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Columbus Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Penick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/449/index.html">443 U. S. 449</a>, 455, n.\xc2\xa03 (1979); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Board of School Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Mobile Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/33/index.html">402 U.

Thus, in respect to race-conscious desegregation measures that the Constitution <em>permitted, </em>but did not <em>require </em>(measures similar to those at issue here), this Court unanimously stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSchool authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole.  <em>To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html">402 U.

See F. Welch &amp; A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegregation v (1987) (hereinafter Welch) (prepared for the Commission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample of 125 school districts, constituting 20% of national public school enrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different plans over 18 years).  The techniques that different districts have employed range \xe2\x80\x9cfrom voluntary transfer programs to mandatory reassignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 21.  And the design of particular plans has been \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by both the law and the specific needs of the district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration.  More recently, however, progress has stalled.  Between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending a school where minority children constituted more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the Nation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed direction by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the Nation (from 57% to 69% in the South).  Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the South), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year 2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in the South).  As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or over 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools with a white population of less than 1%.  Of these, 2.3 million were black and Latino students, and only 72,000 were white.  Today, more than one in six black children attend a school that is 99\xe2\x80\x93100% minority.  See Appendix A, <em>infra.</em>  In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, many school districts have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in myriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often with race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicating earlier school segregation, bringing about integration, or preventing retrogression.  Seattle and Louisville are two such districts, and the histories of their present plans set forth typical school integration stories.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I describe those histories at length in order to highlight three important features of these cases.  First, the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 plans serve \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interests\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d on any reasonable definition of those terms.  Second, the distinction between <em>de jure</em> segregation (caused by school systems) and <em>de facto </em>segregation (caused, <em>e.g.</em>, by housing patterns or generalized societal discrimination) is meaningless in the present context, thereby dooming the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s endeavor to find support for its views in that distinction.  Third, real-world efforts to substitute racially diverse for racially segregated schools (however caused) are complex, to the point where the Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule out categorically all local efforts to use means that are \xe2\x80\x9cconscious\xe2\x80\x9d of the race of individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts began with schools that were highly segregated in fact.  In both cities plaintiffs filed lawsuits claiming unconstitutional segregation.  In Louisville, a federal district court found that school segregation reflected pre-<em>Brown </em>state laws separating the races.  In Seattle, the plaintiffs alleged that school segregation unconstitutionally reflected not only generalized societal discrimination and residential housing patterns, but also<em> school board policies and actions</em> that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate racial segregation.  In Louisville, a federal court entered a remedial decree.  In Seattle, the parties settled after the school district pledged to undertake a desegregation plan.  In both cities, the school boards adopted plans designed to achieve integration by bringing about more racially diverse schools.  In each city the school board modified its plan several times in light of, for example, hostility to busing, the threat of resegregation, and the desirability of introducing greater student choice.  And in each city, the school boards\xe2\x80\x99 plans have evolved over time in ways that progressively <em>diminish </em>the plans\xe2\x80\x99 use of explicit race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The histories that follow set forth these basic facts.  They are based upon numerous sources, which for ease of exposition I have cataloged, along with their corresponding citations, at Appendix B, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">Seattle </p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x82Segregation, 1945 to 1956.</em>  During and just after World War II, significant numbers of black Americans began to make Seattle their home.  Few black residents lived outside the central section of the city.  Most worked at unskilled jobs.  Although black students made up about 3% of the total Seattle population in the mid-1950\xe2\x80\x99s, nearly all black children attended schools where a majority of the population was minority.  Elementary schools in central Seattle were between 60% and 80% black; Garfield, the central district high school, was more than 50% minority; schools outside the central and southeastern sections of Seattle were virtually all white.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>2.\xe2\x80\x82Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969.</em>  In 1956, a memo for the Seattle School Board reported that school segregation reflected not only segregated housing patterns but also school board policies that permitted white students to transfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer of black students into white schools.  In 1958, black parents whose children attended Harrison Elementary School (with a black student population of over 75%) wrote the Seattle board, complaining that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98boundaries for the Harrison Elementary School were not set in accordance with the long-established standards of the School District \xe2\x80\xa6 but were arbitrarily set with an end to excluding colored children from McGilvra School, which is adjacent to the Harrison school district.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other community groups, the school board adopted a new race-based transfer policy.  The new policy added an explicitly racial criterion: If a place exists in a school, then, irrespective of other transfer criteria, a white student may transfer to a predominantly black school, and a black student may transfer to a predominantly white school.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At that time one high school, Garfield, was about two-thirds minority; eight high schools were virtually all white.  In 1963, the transfer program\xe2\x80\x99s first year, 239 black students and 8 white students transferred.  In 1969, about 2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district\xe2\x80\x99s black students and about 400 of the district\xe2\x80\x99s white students took advantage of the plan.  For the next decade, annual program transfers remained at approximately this level.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>3.\xe2\x80\x82The NAACP\xe2\x80\x99s First Legal Challenge and Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Response, 1969 to 1977.</em>  In 1969 the NAACP filed a federal lawsuit against the school board, claiming that the board had \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully and unconstitutionally\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a system of \xe2\x80\x9cracially segregated public schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  The complaint said that 77% of black public elementary school students in Seattle attended 9 of the city\xe2\x80\x99s 86 elementary schools and that 23 of the remaining schools had no black students at all.  Similarly, of the 1,461 black students enrolled in the 12 senior high schools in Seattle, 1,151 (or 78.8%) attended 3 senior high schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a single school, Garfield.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The complaint charged that the school board had brought about this segregated system in part by \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] and enforc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9crules and regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d in part by \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing . . . boundary lines\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexecuting school attendance policies\xe2\x80\x9d that would create and maintain \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly Negro or non-white schools,\xe2\x80\x9d and in part by building schools \xe2\x80\x9cin such a manner as to restrict the Negro plaintiffs and the class they represent to predominantly negro or non-white schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  The complaint also charged that the board discriminated in assigning teachers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a plan that required race-based transfers and mandatory busing.  The plan created three new middle schools at three school buildings in the predominantly white north end.  It then created a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d student body by assigning to those schools students who would otherwise attend predominantly white, or predominantly black, schools elsewhere.  It used explicitly racial criteria in making these assignments (<em>i.e.</em>, it deliberately assigned to the new middle schools black students, not white students, from the black schools and white students, not black students, from the white schools).  And it used busing to transport the students to their new assignments.  The plan provoked considerable local opposition.  Opponents brought a lawsuit.  But eventually a state court found that the mandatory busing was lawful.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1976\xe2\x80\x931977, the plan involved the busing of about 500 middle school students (300 black students and 200 white students).  Another 1,200 black students and 400 white students participated in the previously adopted voluntary transfer program.  Thus about 2,000 students out of a total district population of about 60,000 students were involved in one or the other transfer program.  At that time, about 20% or 12,000 of the district\xe2\x80\x99s students were black.  And the board continued to describe 26 of its 112 schools as \xe2\x80\x9csegregated.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em><f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.</f></em>\xe2\x80\x82<em>The NAACP\xe2\x80\x99s Second Legal Challenge, 1977.</em>  In 1977, the NAACP filed another legal complaint, this time with the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). <em> </em>The complaint alleged that the Seattle School Board had created or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation through, <em>e.g.</em>, certain school-transfer criteria, a construction program that needlessly built new schools in white areas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of inferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial criteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and a general pattern of delay in respect to the implementation of promised desegregation efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The OCR and the school board entered into a formal settlement agreement.  The agreement required the board to implement what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cSeattle Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05.\xe2\x80\x82The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988.  </em>The board began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978. This plan labeled \xe2\x80\x9cracially imbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d any school at which the percentage of black students exceeded by more than 20% the minority population of the school district as a whole.  It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4 high schools\xe2\x80\x94Cleveland (72.8% minority), Franklin (76.6% minority), Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier Beach (58.9% minority).  The plan paired (or \xe2\x80\x9ctriaded\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cimbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d black schools with \xe2\x80\x9cimbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d white schools.  It then placed some grades (say, third and fourth grades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth and sixth grades) at the other school building.  And it thereby required, for example, all fourth grade students from the previously black and previously white schools first to attend together what would now be a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d fourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the next year to attend what would now be a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d fifth grade at the other school building.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the plan provided that a previous \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d school would remain about 50% black, while a previous \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d school would remain about two-thirds white.  It was consequently necessary to decide with some care <em>which </em>students would attend the new \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d grade.  For this purpose, administrators cataloged the racial makeup of each neighborhood housing block.  The school district met its percentage goals by assigning to the new \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d school an appropriate number of \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d housing blocks and \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d housing blocks.  At the same time, transport from house to school involved extensive busing, with about half of all students attending a school other than the one closest to their home.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it sought.  Just prior to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s implementation, for example, 4 of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s 11 high schools were \xe2\x80\x9cimbalanced,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, almost exclusively \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d or almost exclusively \xe2\x80\x9cwhite.\xe2\x80\x9d  By 1979, only two were out of \xe2\x80\x9cbalance.\xe2\x80\x9d  By 1980 only Cleveland remained out of \xe2\x80\x9cbalance\xe2\x80\x9d (as the board defined it) and that by a mere two students.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, provoked serious opposition within the State.  See generally <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/457/index.html">458 U. S. 457</a>, 461\xe2\x80\x93466 (1982).  Thus, Washington state voters enacted an initiative that amended state law to require students to be assigned to the schools closest to their homes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 462.  The Seattle School Board challenged the constitutionality of the initiative.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 464.  This Court then held that the initiative\xe2\x80\x94which would have prevented the Seattle Plan from taking effect\xe2\x80\x94violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 470.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa06.\xe2\x80\x82Student Choice, 1988 to 1998.  </em>By 1988, many white families had left the school district, and many Asian families had moved in. <em> </em>The public school population had fallen from about 100,000 to less than 50,000.  The racial makeup of the school population amounted to 43% white, 24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with Hispanics and Native Americans making up the rest.  The cost of busing, the harm that members of all racial communities feared that the Seattle Plan caused, the desire to attract white families back to the public schools, and the interest in providing greater school choice led the board to abandon busing and to substitute a new student assignment policy that resembles the plan now before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The new plan permitted each student to choose the school he or she wished to attend, subject to race-based constraints.  In respect to high schools, for example, a student was given a list of a subset of schools, carefully selected by the board to balance racial distribution in the district by including neighborhood schools and schools in racially different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city.  The student could then choose among those schools, indicating a first choice, and other choices the student found acceptable.  In making an assignment to a particular high school, the district would give first preference to a student with a sibling already at the school.  It gave second preference to a student whose race differed from a race that was \xe2\x80\x9cover-represented\xe2\x80\x9d at the school (<em>i.e.,</em> a race that accounted for a higher percentage of the school population than of the total district population).  It gave third preference to students residing in the neighborhood.  It gave fourth preference to students who received child care in the neighborhood.  In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000 potential high school students participated. About 68% received their first choice.  Another 16% received an \xe2\x80\x9cacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d choice.  A further 16% were assigned to a school they had not listed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07.\xe2\x80\x82The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present.</em>  In 1996, the school board adopted the present plan, which began in 1999.  In doing so, it sought to deemphasize the use of racial criteria and to increase the likelihood that a student would receive an assignment at his first or second choice high school.  The district retained a racial tiebreaker for oversubscribed schools, which takes effect only if the school\xe2\x80\x99s minority or majority enrollment falls outside of a 30% range centered on the minority/majority population ratio within the district.  At the same time, all students were free subsequently to transfer from the school at which they were initially placed to a different school of their choice without regard to race.  Thus, at worst, a student would have to spend one year at a high school he did not pick as a first or second choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The new plan worked roughly as expected for the two school years during which it was in effect (1999\xe2\x80\x932000 and 2000\xe2\x80\x932001).  In the 2000\xe2\x80\x932001 school year, for example, with the racial tiebreaker, the entering ninth grade class at Franklin High School had a 60% minority population; without the racial tiebreaker that same class at Franklin would have had an almost 80% minority population.  (We consider only the ninth grade since only students entering that class were subject to the tiebreaker, and because the plan was not in place long enough to change the composition of an entire school.)  In the year 2005\xe2\x80\x932006, by which time the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several years, Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s overall minority enrollment had risen to 90%.  During the period the tiebreaker applied, it typically affected about 300 students per year.  Between 80% and 90% of all students received their first choice assignment; between 89% and 97% received their first or second choice assignment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools objected to Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s most recent plan under the State and Federal Constitutions.  In due course, the Washington Supreme Court, the Federal District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc) rejected the challenge and found Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan lawful.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Louisville</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x82Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972.</em>  In 1956, two years after <em>Brown </em>made clear that Kentucky could no longer require racial segregation by law, the Louisville Board of Education created a geography-based student assignment plan designed to help achieve school integration.  At the same time it adopted an open transfer policy under which approximately 3,000 of Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s 46,000 students applied for transfer.  By 1972, however, the Louisville School District remained highly segregated.  Approximately half the district\xe2\x80\x99s public school enrollment was black; about half was white.  Fourteen of the district\xe2\x80\x99s nineteen non-vocational middle and high schools were close to totally black or totally white.  Nineteen of the district\xe2\x80\x99s forty-six elementary schools were between 80% and 100% black.  Twenty-one elementary schools were between roughly 90% and 100% white.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em><f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xe2\x80\x82Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.</f></em>  In 1972, civil rights groups and parents, claiming unconstitutional segregation, sued the Louisville Board of Education in federal court.  The original litigation eventually became a lawsuit against the Jefferson County School System, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s schools and combined them with those of the surrounding suburbs.  (For ease of exposition, I shall still use \xe2\x80\x9cLouisville\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to what is now the combined districts.)  After preliminary rulings and an eventual victory for the plaintiffs in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the District Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring desegregation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The order\xe2\x80\x99s requirements reflected a (newly enlarged) school district student population of about 135,000, approximately 20% of whom were black.  The order required the school board to create and to maintain schools with student populations that ranged, for elementary schools, between 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools (with one exception), between 12.5% and 35% black.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court also adopted a complex desegregation plan designed to achieve the order\xe2\x80\x99s targets.  The plan required redrawing school attendance zones, closing 12 schools, and busing groups of students, selected by race and the first letter of their last names, to schools outside their immediate neighborhoods.  The plan\xe2\x80\x99s initial busing requirements were extensive, involving the busing of 23,000 students and a transportation fleet that had to \xe2\x80\x9coperate from early in the morning until late in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d  For typical students, the plan meant busing for several years (several more years for typical black students than for typical white students).  The following notice, published in a Louisville newspaper in 1976, gives a sense of how the district\xe2\x80\x99s race-based busing plan operated in practice:</p>\n\n[Graphic omitted; see printed opinion]\n\n<p align="left">Louisville Courier Journal, June 18, 1976 (reproduced in J. Wilkinson, From <em>Brown</em> to <em>Bakke:</em> The Supreme Court and School Integration 1954\xe2\x80\x931978, p. 176 (1979)).</p>\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court monitored implementation of the plan.  In 1978, it found that the plan had brought all of Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s schools within its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 for racial composition\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cat least a substantial portion of the [previous] three years.\xe2\x80\x9d  It removed the case from its active docket while stating that it expected the board \xe2\x80\x9cto continue to implement those portions of the desegregation order which are by their nature of a continuing effect.\xe2\x80\x9d<p></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compliance with the order\xe2\x80\x99s racial percentages due to shifting demographics in the community, the school board revised its desegregation plan.  In doing so, the board created a new racial \xe2\x80\x9cguideline,\xe2\x80\x9d namely a \xe2\x80\x9cfloating range of 10% above and 10% below the countywide average for the different grade levels.\xe2\x80\x9d  The board simultaneously redrew district boundaries so that middle school students could attend the same school for three years and high school students for four years.  It added \xe2\x80\x9cmagnet\xe2\x80\x9d programs at two high schools.  And it adjusted its alphabet-based system for grouping and busing students.  The board estimated that its new plan would lead to annual reassignment (with busing) of about 8,500 black students and about 8,000 white students.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>3.\xe2\x80\x82Student Choice and Project Renaissance, 1991 to 1996.  </em>By 1991, the board had concluded that assigning elementary school students to two or more schools during their elementary school years had proved educationally unsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s newly adopted Education Reform Act.  It consequently conducted a nearly year-long review of its plan.  In doing so, it consulted widely with parents and other members of the local community, using public presentations, public meetings, and various other methods to obtain the public\xe2\x80\x99s input.  At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted a new plan, called \xe2\x80\x9cProject Renaissance,\xe2\x80\x9d that emphasized student choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Project Renaissance again revised the board\xe2\x80\x99s racial guidelines.  It provided that each elementary school would have a black student population of between 15% and 50%; each middle and high school would have a black population and a white population that fell within a range, the boundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below the general student population percentages in the county at that grade level.  The plan then drew new geographical school assignment zones designed to satisfy these guidelines; the district could reassign students if particular schools failed to meet the guidelines and was required to do so if a school repeatedly missed these targets.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a neighborhood line around each elementary school, and it then drew a second line around groups of elementary schools (called \xe2\x80\x9cclusters\xe2\x80\x9d).  It initially assigned each student to his or her neighborhood school, but it permitted each student freely to transfer between elementary schools within each cluster <em>provided that </em>the transferring student (a) was black if transferring from a predominantly black school to a predominantly white school, or (b) was white if transferring from a predominantly white school to a predominantly black school.  Students could also apply to attend magnet elementary schools or programs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plan required each middle school student to be assigned to his or her neighborhood school unless the student applied for, and was accepted by, a magnet middle school.  The plan provided for \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d high school enrollment.  Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high school in the system, and the high school would accept applicants according to set criteria\xe2\x80\x94one of which consisted of the need to attain or remain in compliance with the plan\xe2\x80\x99s racial guidelines.  Finally, the plan created two new magnet schools, one each at the elementary and middle school levels.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xe2\x80\x82The Current Plan: Project Renaissance Modified, 1996 to 2003.  </em>In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School Board, with the help of a special \xe2\x80\x9cPlanning Team,\xe2\x80\x9d community meetings, and other official and unofficial study groups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance and considered proposals for improvement.  Consequently, in 1996, the board modified Project Renaissance, thereby creating the present plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time, the district\xe2\x80\x99s public school population was approximately 30% black.  The plan consequently redrew the racial \xe2\x80\x9cguidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d setting the boundaries at 15% to 50% black for <em>all </em>schools.  It again redrew school assignment boundaries.  And it expanded the transfer opportunities available to elementary and middle school pupils.  The plan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer would lead to a school population outside the guideline range, <em>i.e.</em>, if it would create a school where fewer than 15% or more than 50% of the students were black.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plan also established \xe2\x80\x9cParent Assistance Centers\xe2\x80\x9d to help parents and students navigate the school selection and assignment process.  It pledged the use of other resources in order to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage all schools to achieve an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment at the school\xe2\x80\x99s respective elementary, middle or high school level.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the plan continued use of magnet schools.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal court attacking the plan\xe2\x80\x99s use of racial guidelines at one of the district\xe2\x80\x99s magnet schools.  They asked the court to dissolve the desegregation order and to hold the use of <em>magnet</em> school racial guidelines unconstitutional.  The board opposed dissolution, arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe old dual system\xe2\x80\x9d had left a \xe2\x80\x9cdemographic imbalance\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ed] dissolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 2000, after reviewing the present plan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order.  It wrote that there was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  It added that the Louisville School Board had \xe2\x80\x9ctreated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligation\xe2\x80\x94they consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also found that the magnet programs available at the high school in question were \xe2\x80\x9cnot available at other high schools\xe2\x80\x9d in the school district.  It consequently held unconstitutional the use of race-based \xe2\x80\x9ctargets\xe2\x80\x9d to govern admission to <em>magnet schools</em>.  And it ordered the board not to control access to those scarce programs through the use of racial targets.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05.\xe2\x80\x82The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present.  </em>Subsequent to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dissolution of the desegregation order (in 2000) the board simply continued to implement its 1996 plan as modified to reflect the court\xe2\x80\x99s magnet school determination.  In 2003, the petitioner now before us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challenging the plan\xe2\x80\x99s unmodified portions, <em>i.e.</em>, those portions that dealt with <em>ordinary</em>, not magnet, schools.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected Meredith\xe2\x80\x99s challenge and held the unmodified aspects of the plan constitutional.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and ongoing efforts of two school districts to bring about greater racial integration of their public schools.  In both cases the efforts were in part remedial.  Louisville began its integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in 1975 entered a school desegregation order.  Seattle undertook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a federal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segregation complaint filed with the federal OCR.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of these earlier remedial efforts.  Both districts faced problems that reflected initial periods of severe racial segregation, followed by such remedial efforts as busing, followed by evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to end busing and encourage the return of, <em>e.g.</em>, suburban students through increased student choice.  When formulating the plans under review, both districts drew upon their considerable experience with earlier plans, having revised their policies periodically in light of that experience.  Both districts rethought their methods over time and explored a wide range of other means, including non-race-conscious policies.  Both districts also considered elaborate studies and consulted widely within their communities. </f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both districts sought greater racial integration for educational and democratic, as well as for remedial, reasons.  Both sought to achieve these objectives while preserving their commitment to other educational goals, <em>e.g.</em>, districtwide commitment to high quality public schools, increased pupil assignment to neighborhood schools, diminished use of busing, greater student choice, reduced risk of white flight, and so forth.  Consequently, the present plans expand student choice; they limit the burdens (including busing) that earlier plans had imposed upon students and their families; and they use race-conscious criteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways.  In particular, they use race-conscious criteria only to mark the outer bounds of broad population-related ranges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The histories also make clear the futility of looking simply to whether earlier school segregation was <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto</em> in order to draw firm lines separating the constitutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden use of \xe2\x80\x9crace-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d criteria.  Justice Thomas suggests that it will be easy to identify <em>de jure</em> segregation because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n most cases, there either will or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the races.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa04 (concurring opinion).  But our precedent has recognized that <em>de jure</em> discrimination can be present even in the absence of racially explicit laws.  See <em>Yick Wo</em> v. <em>Hopkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/118/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/118/356/index.html">118 U. S. 356</a>, 373\xe2\x80\x93374 (1886).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one here disputes that Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>segregation was <em>de jure</em>.<em> </em>But what about Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s?  Was it <em>de facto?</em> <em>De jure?</em>  A mixture?  Opinions differed.  Or is it that a prior federal court had not adjudicated the matter?  Does that make a difference?  Is Seattle free on remand to say that its schools were <em>de jure</em> segregated, just as in 1956 a memo for the School Board admitted?  The plurality does not seem confident as to the answer.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 12 (opinion of the Court) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Seattle public schools <em>have never shown</em> that they were ever segregated by law\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)), with <em>ante</em> at 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (plurality opinion) (assuming \xe2\x80\x9cthe Seattle school district was never segregated by law,\xe2\x80\x9d but seeming to concede that a school district with <em>de jure</em> segregation need not be subject to a court order to be allowed to engage in race-based remedial measures).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A court finding of <em>de jure </em>segregation cannot be the crucial variable.  After all, a number of school districts in the South that the Government or private plaintiffs challenged as segregated <em>by law</em> voluntarily desegregated their schools <em>without a court order</em>\xe2\x80\x94just as Seattle did.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Coleman, Desegregation of the Public Schools\nin Kentucky\xe2\x80\x94The Second Year After the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Decision, 25 J. Negro Educ. 254, 256, 261 (1956) (40 of Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s 180 school districts began desegre-\ngation without court orders); Branton, Little Rock\nRevisited: Desegregation to Resegregation, 52 J.

Politics 987, 991 (1976) (similar in Georgia); <em>McDaniel</em> v. <em>Barresi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/39/index.html">402 U. S. 39</a>, 40, n. 1 (1971) (Clarke County, Georgia).

How could such a plan be lawful the day before dissolution but then become unlawful the very next day?  On what legal ground can the majority rest its contrary view?  But see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, 17, n. 12.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Are courts really to treat as merely <em>de facto</em> segregated those school districts that avoided a federal order by voluntarily complying with <em>Brown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements?  See <em>id.</em>, at 12, 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  This Court has previously done just the opposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without any kind of court decree.  See <em>McDaniel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 41.  Because the Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of race-conscious measures by districts in the South that voluntarily desegregated their schools, on what basis does the plurality claim that the law forbids Seattle to do the same?  But see <em>ante</em>, at 29.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks and the practical difficulties that local school boards face when they seek to achieve greater racial integration.  The boards work in communities where demographic patterns change, where they must meet traditional learning goals, where they must attract and retain effective teachers, where they should (and will) take account of parents\xe2\x80\x99 views and maintain <em>their</em> commitment to public school education, where they must adapt to court intervention, where they must encourage voluntary student and parent action\xe2\x80\x94where they will find that their own good faith, their knowledge, and their understanding of local circumstances are always necessary but often insufficient to solve the problems at hand.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These facts and circumstances help explain why in this context, as to means, the law often leaves legislatures, city councils, school boards, and voters with a broad range of choice, thereby giving \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent communities\xe2\x80\x9d the opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9ctry different solutions to common problems and gravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem to them best to suit their individual needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Comfort</em> v. <em>Lynn School Comm.</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 28 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U.

Because of its importance, I shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in Swann</em>.  Chief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional importance, wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSchool authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole.  To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  402 U.

Indeed, in <em>McDaniel</em>, a case decided the same day as <em>Swann</em>, a group of parents challenged a race-conscious student assignment plan that the Clarke County School Board had <em>voluntarily</em> adopted as a remedy without a court order (though under federal agency pressure\xe2\x80\x94pressure Seattle also encountered).  The plan required that each elementary school in the district maintain 20% to 40% enrollment of African-American students, corresponding to the racial composition of the district.  See <em>Barresi</em> v. <em>Browne</em>, 226 Ga. 456, 456\xe2\x80\x93459, 175 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 649, 650\xe2\x80\x93651 (1970).  This Court upheld the plan, see <em>McDaniel</em>,<em> </em>402 U.

The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Seattle was \xe2\x80\x9cnever segregated by law\xe2\x80\x9d is simply not accurate.  Compare <em>ante</em>, at 29, with <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.  The plurality could validly claim that <em>no court</em> ever found that Seattle schools were segregated in law.  But that is also true of the Clarke County schools in <em>McDaniel</em>.  Unless we believe that the Constitution enforces one legal standard for the South and another for the North, this Court should grant Seattle the permission it granted Clarke County, Georgia.  See <em>McDaniel</em>, 402 U. S., at 41 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]teps will almost invariably require that students be assigned \xe2\x80\x98differently because of their race.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . Any other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has also held that school districts may be required by federal statute to undertake race-conscious desegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that <em>de jure</em> segregation can be shown.

S. 130</a>, 148\xe2\x80\x93149 (1979), the Court concluded that a federal statute required school districts receiving certain federal funds to remedy faculty segregation, even though in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view the racial disparities in the affected schools were purely <em>de facto</em> and would not have been actionable under the Equal Protection Clause.  Not even the dissenters thought the race-conscious remedial program posed a <em>constitutional </em>problem.  See <em>id.</em>, at 152 (opinion of Stewart, J.).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/527/index.html">458 U.

However, the question as to whether the constitution requires a local school board, or a State, to act to undo <em>de facto</em> school segregation is simply not here concerned.

These decisions illustrate well how lower courts understood and followed <em>Swann</em>\xe2\x80\x99s enunciation of the relevant legal principle.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally valid the legal principle that <em>Swann </em>enunciated\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that the government may voluntarily adopt race-conscious measures to improve conditions of race even when it is not under a constitutional obligation to do so.  That principle has been accepted by every branch of government and is rooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself.  Thus, Congress has enacted numerous race-conscious statutes that illustrate that principle or rely upon its validity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa76311(b)(2)(C)(v) (No Child Left Behind Act); \xc2\xa71067 <em>et seq.</em> (authorizing aid to minority institutions).  In fact, without being exhaustive, I have counted 51 federal statutes that use racial classifications.  I have counted well over 100 state statutes that similarly employ racial classifications.  Presidential administrations for the past half-century have used and supported various race-conscious measures.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Exec. Order No. 10925, 26 Fed. Reg. 1977 (1961) (President Kennedy); Exec. Order No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President Johnson); Sugrue, Breaking Through: The Troubled Origins of Affirmative Action in the Workplace, in Colorlines: Affirmative Action, Immigration, and Civil Rights Options for America 31 (Skretny ed. 2001) (describing President Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s lobbying for affirmative action plans, <em>e.g.</em>, the Philadelphia Plan); White, Affirmative Action\xe2\x80\x99s Alamo: Gerald Ford Returns to Fight Once More for Michigan, Time, Aug. 23, 1999, p. 48 (reporting on President Ford\xe2\x80\x99s support for affirmative action); Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y Rev. 1, 50 (2002) (describing President Carter\xe2\x80\x99s support for affirmation action).  And during the same time, hundreds of local school districts have adopted student assignment plans that use race-conscious criteria.  See Welch 83\xe2\x80\x9391.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That <em>Swann</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>legal statement should find such broad acceptance is not surprising.  For <em>Swann</em> is predicated upon a well-established legal view of the Fourteenth Amendment.  That view understands the basic objective of those who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as forbidding practices that lead to racial exclusion.  The Amendment sought to bring into American society as full members those whom the Nation had previously held in slavery.  See <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1872) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we mean the freedom of the slave race\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Strauder</em> v. <em>West Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/303/index.html"></a><a href="/us/100/303/index.html">100 U.

See generally R. Sears, A Utopian Experiment in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality at Berea, 1866\xe2\x80\x931904<em> </em>(1996) (describing federal funding, through the Freedman\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, of race-conscious school integration programs).  See also R. Fischer, The Segregation Struggle in Louisiana 1862\xe2\x80\x9377, p. 51 (1974) (describing the use of race-conscious remedies); Harlan, Desegregation in New Orleans Public Schools During Reconstruction, 67 Am.

Although the Constitution almost always forbids the former, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the latter.  See <em>Gratz</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/244/index.html">539 U. S. 244</a>, 301 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 243 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about the degree of leniency that the Clause affords to programs designed to include.  See <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, 274 (1986); <em>Fullilove </em>v. <em>Klutznick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/448/index.html">448 U. S. 448</a>, 507 (1980).  But I can find no case in which this Court has followed Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccolorblind\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  And I have found no case that otherwise repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <em>exclude </em>and that which seeks to <em>include </em>members of minority races.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What does the plurality say in response?  First, it seeks to distinguish <em>Swann </em>and other similar cases on the ground that those cases involved remedial plans in response to <em>judicial findings </em>of <em>de jure </em>segregation.  As <em>McDaniel </em>and <em>Harris </em>show, that is historically untrue.  See <em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  Many school districts in the South adopted segregation remedies (to which <em>Swann</em> clearly applies) without any such federal order<em>,</em> see <em>supra,</em> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  See also Kennedy Report.  Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances are not meaningfully different from those in, say, <em>McDaniel</em>, where this Court approved race-conscious remedies.  Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s plan was created and initially adopted when a compulsory district court order was in place.  And, in any event, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear that this distinction\xe2\x80\x94between court-ordered and voluntary desegregation\xe2\x80\x94seeks a line that sensibly cannot be drawn.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the plurality downplays the importance of <em>Swann </em>and related cases by frequently describing their relevant statements as \xe2\x80\x9cdicta.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These criticisms, however, miss the main point.  <em>Swann </em>did not hide its understanding of the law in a corner of an obscure opinion or in a footnote, unread but by experts.  It set forth its view prominently in an important opinion joined by all nine Justices, knowing that it would be read and followed throughout the Nation.  The basic problem with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s technical \xe2\x80\x9cdicta\xe2\x80\x9d-based response<em> </em>lies in its overly theoretical approach to case law, an approach that emphasizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a way that serves to mask the radical nature of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Law is not an exercise in mathematical logic.  And statements of a legal rule set forth in a judicial opinion do not always divide neatly into \xe2\x80\x9choldings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdicta.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Consider the legal \xe2\x80\x9cstatus\xe2\x80\x9d of Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion in <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Bakke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/265/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/265/index.html">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978).)  The constitutional principle enunciated in <em>Swann, </em>reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied upon over many years, provides, and has widely been thought to provide, authoritative legal guidance.  And if the plurality now chooses to reject that principle, it cannot adequately justify its retreat simply by affixing the label \xe2\x80\x9cdicta\xe2\x80\x9d to reasoning with which it disagrees.  Rather, it must explain to the courts and to the Nation <em>why </em>it would abandon guidance set forth many years before, guidance that countless others have built upon over time, and which the law has continuously embodied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a more important response is the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s claim that later cases\xe2\x80\x94in particular <em>Johnson</em>,<em> Adarand</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Grutter</em>\xe2\x80\x94supplanted <em>Swann</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, 31\xe2\x80\x9332, n.\xc2\xa016, 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (citing <em>Adarand</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 227; <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/499/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/499/index.html">543 U. S. 499</a>, 505 (2005); <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 326 (2003)).  The plurality says that cases such as <em>Swann </em>and the others I have described all \xe2\x80\x9cwere decided before this Court definitively determined that \xe2\x80\x98all racial classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31, n.\xc2\xa016 (quoting <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U. S., at 227).  This Court in <em>Adarand </em>added that \xe2\x80\x9csuch classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the Court repeated this same statement in <em>Grutter</em>.  See 539 U. S., at 326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several of these cases were significantly more restrictive than <em>Swann </em>in respect to the degree of leniency the Fourteenth Amendment grants to programs designed to <em>include</em> people of all races.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Gratz</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>.  But that legal circumstance cannot make a critical difference here for two separate reasons.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, no case\xe2\x80\x94not <em>Adarand</em>, <em>Gratz</em>, <em>Grutter</em>, or any other\xe2\x80\x94has ever held that the test of \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d means that all racial classifications\xe2\x80\x94no matter whether they seek to include or exclude\xe2\x80\x94must in practice be treated the same.  The Court did not say in <em>Adarand</em> or in <em>Johnson </em>or in <em>Grutter</em> that it was overturning <em>Swann </em>or its central constitutional principle.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of strict scrutiny review is to \xe2\x80\x9ctake relevant differences\xe2\x80\x9d between \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally different situations . . . into account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court made clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]trict scrutiny does not trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It added that the fact that a law \xe2\x80\x9ctreats [a person] unequally because of his or her race . . . says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 229\xe2\x80\x93230 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the Court, using the very phrase that Justice Marshall had used to describe strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x99s application to any <em>exclusionary</em> use of racial criteria, sought to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>dispel the notion</em> that strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d is as likely to condemn <em>inclusive</em> uses of \xe2\x80\x9crace-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d criteria as it is to invalidate <em>exclusionary</em> uses.  That is, it is <em>not</em> in all circumstances \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strict in theory, but fatal in fact.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 237 (quoting <em>Fullilove</em> v. <em>Klutznick</em>, 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Grutter</em> elaborated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStrict scrutiny is not \xe2\x80\x98strict in theory, but fatal in fact.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . Although all governmental uses of race\nare subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated\nby it. . . .  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cContext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.  See <em>Gomillion</em> v. <em>Lightfoot</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/index.html"></a><a href="/us/364/339/index.html">364 U. S. 339</a>, 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (1960) (admonishing that, \xe2\x80\x98in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts\xe2\x80\x99). . . . Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 326\xe2\x80\x93327.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Grutter </em>demonstrates that the Court meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite law school\xe2\x80\x99s race-conscious admissions program.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality refers, though all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat exclusive and inclusive uses the same.  Rather, they apply the strict scrutiny test in a manner that is \xe2\x80\x9cfatal in fact\xe2\x80\x9d only to racial classifications that harmfully <em>exclude;</em> they apply the test in a manner that is <em>not</em> fatal in fact to racial classifications that seek to <em>include</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality cannot avoid this simple fact.  See <em>ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9336.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reveals that the plurality would rewrite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior jurisprudence, at least in practical application, transforming the \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d test into a rule that is fatal in fact across the board.  In doing so, the plurality parts company from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases, and it takes from local government the longstanding legal right to use race-conscious criteria for inclusive purposes in limited ways.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, as <em>Grutter </em>specified, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 327 (citing <em>Gomillion</em> v. <em>Lightfoot, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/index.html"></a><a href="/us/364/339/index.html">364 U. S. 339</a>, 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (1960)).  And contexts differ dramatically one from the other.  Governmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context of, for example, census forms, research expenditures for diseases, assignments of police officers patrolling predominantly minority-race neighborhoods, efforts to desegregate racially segregated schools, policies that favor minorities when distributing goods or services in short supply, actions that create majority-minority electoral districts, peremptory strikes that remove potential jurors on the basis of race, and others.  Given the significant differences among these contexts, it would be surprising if the law required an identically strict legal test for evaluating the constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to advance or to maintain racial integration in primary and secondary schools.  It is a context, as <em>Swann </em>makes clear, where history has required special administrative remedies.  And it is a context in which the school boards\xe2\x80\x99 plans simply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of a broad range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This context is <em>not</em> a context that involves the use of race to decide who will receive goods or services that are normally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in short supply.  It is not one in which race-conscious limits stigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the races against each other or otherwise significantly exacerbate racial tensions.  They do not impose burdens unfairly upon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits for members of all races alike.  The context here is one of racial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to bring them together.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of these differences is clear once one compares the present circumstances with other cases where one or more of these negative features are present.

Compare <em>Wessmann</em> v. <em>Gittens</em>, 160 F.\xc2\xa03d 790, 809\xe2\x80\x93810 (CA1 1998) (Boudin, J., concurring), with <em>Comfort</em>, 418 F. 3d, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring).  They do not seek to award a scarce commodity on the basis of merit, for they are not magnet schools; rather, by design and in practice, they offer substantially equivalent academic programs and electives.  Although some parents or children prefer some schools over others, school popularity has varied significantly over the years.  In 2000, for example, Roosevelt was the most popular first choice high school in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was the most popular; in 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular; by 2003, it was one of the more popular.  See Research, Evaluation and Assessment, Student Information Serv-\nices Office, District Summaries 1999\xe2\x80\x932005, available at\nhttp: //www.seattleschools.org\xc2\xa0/area\xc2\xa0/siso\xc2\xa0/disprof\xc2\xa0/2005\xc2\xa0/DP05 all.pdf.  In a word, the school plans under review do not involve the kind of race-based harm that has led this Court, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious criteria unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These and related considerations convinced one Ninth Circuit judge in the Seattle case to apply a standard of constitutionality review that is less than \xe2\x80\x9cstrict,\xe2\x80\x9d and to conclude that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents do not require the contrary.  See 426 F.\xc2\xa03d 1162, 1193\xe2\x80\x931194 (2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThat a student is denied the school of his choice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial stigma and says nothing at all about that individual\xe2\x80\x99s aptitude or ability\xe2\x80\x9d).  That judge is not alone.  Cf. <em>Gratz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 301 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 243 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Carter, When Victims Happen To Be Black, 97 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 420, 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The view that a more lenient standard than \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d should apply in the present context would not imply abandonment of judicial efforts carefully to determine the need for race-conscious criteria and the criteria\xe2\x80\x99s tailoring in light of the need.  And the present context requires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious program at issue.  In doing so, a reviewing judge must be fully aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls that Justice Thomas and Justice Kennedy mention.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>ante</em>, at 3, 17 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be aware that a legislature or school administrators, ultimately accountable to the electorate, could <em>nonetheless </em>properly conclude that a racial classification sometimes serves a purpose important enough to overcome the risks they mention, for example, helping to end racial isolation or to achieve a diverse student body in public schools.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  Where that is so, the judge would carefully examine the program\xe2\x80\x99s details to determine whether the use of race-conscious criteria is proportionate to the important ends it serves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is altogether fitting.  I believe that the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not \xe2\x80\x9cstrict\xe2\x80\x9d in the traditional sense of that word, although it does require the careful review I have just described.  See <em>Gratz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 301 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Souter, J., dissenting); <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at<em> </em>242\xe2\x80\x93249 (Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting); 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1193\xe2\x80\x931194 (Kozinski, J., concurring).  Apparently Justice Kennedy also agrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to certain \xe2\x80\x9crace-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d school board policies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9cExecutive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, in light of <em>Grutter</em> and other precedents, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bakke</em>, 438 U. S., at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I shall adopt the first alternative.  I shall apply the version of strict scrutiny that those cases embody.  I shall consequently ask whether the school boards in Seattle and Louisville adopted these plans to serve a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling governmental interest\xe2\x80\x9d and, if so, whether the plans are \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve that interest.  If the plans survive this strict review, they would survive less exacting review <em>a fortiori</em>.  Hence, I conclude that the plans before us pass both parts of the strict scrutiny test.  Consequently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted under the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Applying the Legal Standard</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">Compelling Interest</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify the use of race-based criteria goes by various names.  Sometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving racial \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Other times a court, like the plurality here, refers to it as an interest in racial \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have used more general terms to signify that interest, describing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or preserving greater racial \xe2\x80\x9cintegration\xe2\x80\x9d of public schools.  By this term, I mean the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 interest in eliminating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the degree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the district\xe2\x80\x99s schools and each individual student\xe2\x80\x99s public school experience.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake possesses three essential elements.  First, there is a historical and remedial element: an interest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of segregation.  This refers back to a time when public schools were highly segregated, often as a result of legal or administrative policies that facilitated racial segregation in public schools.  It is an interest in continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by these school-related policies, which have often affected not only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.  It is an interest in maintaining hard-won gains.  And it has its roots in preventing what gradually may become the de facto</em> resegregation of America\xe2\x80\x99s public schools.  See Part I, <em>supra</em>, at 4; Appendix A, <em>infra.</em>  See also <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 17 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, there is an educational element: an interest in overcoming the adverse educational effects produced by and associated with highly segregated schools.  Cf. <em>Grutter</em>, 539 U. S.<em>,</em> at 345 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  Studies suggest that children taken from those schools and placed in integrated settings often show positive academic gains.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing and Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kearney, &amp; V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter Powell); Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, 59 Ohio St. L.\xc2\xa0J. 733, 741\xe2\x80\x93742 (1998) (hereinafter Hallinan).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other studies reach different conclusions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, D. Armor, Forced Justice (1995).  See also <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317 (Thomas, J., concurring).  But the evidence supporting an educational interest in racially integrated schools is well established and strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Research suggests, for example, that black children from segregated educational environments significantly increase their achievement levels once they are placed in a more integrated setting.  Indeed in Louisville itself the achievement gap between black and white elementary school students grew substantially smaller (by seven percentage points) after the integration plan was implemented in 1975.  See Powell 35.  Conversely, to take another example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Virginia, shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in the achievement test scores of children of all races.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the educational benefits of desegregated schooling, found that the studies have provided \xe2\x80\x9cremarkably consistent\xe2\x80\x9d results, showing that: (1) black students\xe2\x80\x99 educational achievement is improved in integrated schools as compared to racially isolated schools, (2) black students\xe2\x80\x99 educational achievement is improved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier that black students are removed from racial isolation, the better their educational outcomes.  See Hallinan 741\xe2\x80\x93742.  Multiple studies also indicate that black alumni of integrated schools are more likely to move into occupations traditionally closed to African-Americans, and to earn more money in those fields.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Schofield, Review of Research on School Desegregation\xe2\x80\x99s Impact on Elementary and Secondary School Students, in Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education 597, 606\xe2\x80\x93607 (J. Banks &amp; C. Banks eds. 1995).  Cf. W. Bowen &amp; D. Bok, The Shape of the River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen &amp; Bok). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the \xe2\x80\x9cpluralistic society\xe2\x80\x9d in which our children will live.  <em>Swann</em>, 402 U. S., at 16.  It is an interest in helping our children learn to work and play together with children of different racial backgrounds.  It is an interest in teaching children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, data support this insight.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Hallinan 745; Quillian &amp; Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Present and Future of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68 Am. Sociological Rev. 540, 541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian &amp; Campbell); Dawkins &amp; Braddock, The Continuing Significance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition and African American Inclusion in American Society, 63 J. Negro Ed. 394, 401\xe2\x80\x93403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins &amp; Braddock); Wells &amp; Crain, Perpetuation Theory and the Long-Term Effects of School Desegregation, 64 Rev. Educational Research 531, 550 (1994) (hereinafter Wells &amp; Crain).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are again studies that offer contrary conclusions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991).  See also <em>ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (Thomas, J., concurring).  Again, however, the evidence supporting a democratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly established and sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine, as this Court has itself often found, that this interest is compelling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, one study documented that \xe2\x80\x9cblack and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cinterracial contact in desegregated schools leads to an increase in interracial sociability and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hallinan 745.  See also Quillian &amp; Campbell 541.  Cf. Bowen &amp; Bok 155.  Other studies have found that both black and white students who attend integrated schools are more likely to work in desegregated companies after graduation than students who attended racially isolated schools.  Dawkins &amp; Braddock 401\xe2\x80\x93403; Wells &amp; Crain 550.  Further research has shown that the desegregation of schools can help bring adult communities together by reducing segregated housing.  Cities that have implemented successful school desegregation plans have witnessed increased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to become less racially segregated.  Dawkins &amp; Braddock 403.  These effects not only reinforce the prior gains of integrated primary and secondary education; they also foresee a time when there is less need to use race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, this Court from <em>Swann </em>to <em>Grutter </em>has treated these civic effects as an important virtue of racially diverse education.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Swann</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 16; <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</em>, 458 U. S., at 472\xe2\x80\x93473.  In <em>Grutter, </em>in the context of law school admissions, we found that these types of interests were, constitutionally speaking, \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 539 U. S., at 330 (recognizing that Michigan Law School\xe2\x80\x99s race-conscious admissions policy \xe2\x80\x9cpromotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons of different races,\xe2\x80\x9d and pointing out that \xe2\x80\x9cthe skills needed in today\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions in <em>Grutter, </em>the \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d nature of these interests in the context of primary and secondary public education follows here <em>a fortiori</em>.  Primary and secondary schools are where the education of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s children begins, where each of us begins to absorb those values we carry with us to the end of our days.  As Justice Marshall said, \xe2\x80\x9cunless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milliken </em>v.<em> Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/717/index.html">418 U. S. 717</a>, 783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it was <em>Brown,</em> after all, focusing upon primary and secondary schools, not <em>Sweatt </em>v.<em> Painter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/629/index.html">339 U.

Hence, I am not surprised that Justice Kennedy finds that, \xe2\x80\x9ca district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population,\xe2\x80\x9d including a <em>racially</em> diverse population.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an effort to eradicate the remnants, not of general \xe2\x80\x9csocietal discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23 (plurality opinion), but of primary and secondary school segregation, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, 14; it includes an effort to create school environments that provide better educational opportunities for all children; it includes an effort to help create citizens better prepared to know, to understand, and to work with people of all races and backgrounds, thereby furthering the kind of democratic government our Constitution foresees.  If an educational interest that combines these three elements is not \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling,\xe2\x80\x9d what is?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority acknowledges that in prior cases this Court has recognized at least two interests as compelling: an interest in \xe2\x80\x9cremedying the effects of past intentional discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d and an interest in \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity in higher education.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, 13.  But the plurality does not convincingly explain why those interests do not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d here.  How do the remedial interests here differ in kind from those at issue in the voluntary desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy many years ago described in his letter to the President?  <em>Supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  How do the educational and civic interests differ in kind from those that underlie and justify the racial \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d that the law school sought in <em>Grutter</em>, where this Court found a compelling interest?  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to the well-established conceptual difference between <em>de jure </em>segregation (\xe2\x80\x9csegregation by state action\xe2\x80\x9d) and <em>de facto </em>segregation (\xe2\x80\x9cracial imbalance caused by other factors\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  But that distinction concerns what the Constitution <em>requires </em>school boards to do, not what it <em>permits </em>them to do.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Green,</em> 391 U.\xe2\x80\x82S., at 437\xe2\x80\x93438 (\xe2\x80\x9cSchool boards \xe2\x80\xa6 operating state-compelled dual systems\xe2\x80\x9d have an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch\xe2\x80\x9d), with,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Milliken</em>, 418 U.\xe2\x80\x82S., at 745 (the Constitution does not impose a duty to desegregate upon districts that have not been \xe2\x80\x9cshown to have committed any constitutional violation\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance upon the <em>de jure/de facto </em>distinction only address what remedial measures a school district may be constitutionally <em>required </em>to undertake.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Freeman</em> v. <em>Pitts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/467/index.html">503 U. S. 467</a>, 495 (1992).  As to what is <em>permitted</em>, nothing in our equal protection law suggests that a State may right only those wrongs that it committed.  No case of this Court has ever relied upon the <em>de jure/de facto</em> distinction in order to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed to do.  That is what is at issue here.  And <em>Swann</em>,<em> McDaniel, Crawford</em>, <em>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</em>, <em>Harris</em>, and<em> Bustop</em> made one thing clear: significant as the difference between <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation may be to the question of what a school district <em>must </em>do, that distinction is not germane to the question of what a school district <em>may</em> do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality suggests with respect to Louisville, <em>ante</em>, at 29, that remedial interests vanish the day after a federal court declares that a district is \xe2\x80\x9cunitary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Of course, Louisville adopted those portions of the plan at issue here <em>before </em>a court declared Louisville \xe2\x80\x9cunitary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, in <em>Freeman</em>, this Court pointed out that in \xe2\x80\x9cone sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by state decree do remain in our society and in our schools.  Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs committed by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of history.  And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 495.  See also <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  I do not understand why this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, which rest the significance of a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary\xe2\x80\x9d finding in part upon the wisdom and desirability of returning schools to local control, should deprive those local officials of legal <em>permission </em>to use means they once found necessary to combat persisting injustices.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For his part, Justice Thomas faults my citation of various studies supporting the view that school districts can find compelling educational and civic interests in integrating their public schools.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317, 23 (concurring opinion).  He is entitled of course to his own opinion as to which studies he finds convincing\xe2\x80\x94although it bears mention that even the author of some of Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 preferred studies has found <em>some</em> evidence linking integrated learning environments to increased academic achievement.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citing Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line 239 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S.

I shall not accept the school board\xe2\x80\x99s assurances on faith, cf. Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 920 (1995), and I shall subject the \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring\xe2\x80\x9d of their plans to \xe2\x80\x9crigorous judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grutter</em>, 539 U. S., at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Several factors, taken together, nonetheless lead me to conclude that the boards\xe2\x80\x99 use of race-conscious criteria in these plans passes even the strictest \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring\xe2\x80\x9d test.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set the outer bounds of <em>broad</em> ranges.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 390 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (expressing concern about \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow fluctuation band[s]\xe2\x80\x9d).  They constitute but one part of plans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial elements.  To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden \xe2\x80\x9cquota.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 335 (\xe2\x80\x9cProperly understood, a \xe2\x80\x98quota\xe2\x80\x99 is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are \xe2\x80\x98reserved exclusively for certain minority groups\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Croson</em>, 488 U. S., at 496)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater emphasis upon student choice.  In Seattle, for example, in more than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines which high schools Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s ninth graders will attend.  After ninth grade, students can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria).  <em>Choice</em>, therefore, is the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant factor\xe2\x80\x9d in these plans.  <em>Race</em> is not.  See <em>Grutter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 393 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (allowing consideration of race only if it does \xe2\x80\x9cnot become a predominant factor\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases often have no effect, either because the particular school is not oversubscribed in the year in question, or because the racial makeup of the school falls within the broad range, or because the student is a transfer applicant or has a sibling at the school.  In these respects, the broad ranges are less like a quota and more like the kinds of \xe2\x80\x9cuseful starting points\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has consistently found permissible, even when they set boundaries upon voluntary transfers, and even when they are based upon a community\xe2\x80\x99s general population.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Swann</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/43/index.html"></a><a href="/us/402/43/index.html">402 U. S. 43</a>, 46 (1971) (no \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute prohibition against [the] use\xe2\x80\x9d of mathematical ratios as a \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Swann</em>, 402 U.

Cf. <em>United States </em>v.<em> Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/225/index.html">395 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Swann</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327; <em>Montgomery Co. Bd. of Ed.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 232.  Indeed, the plans before us are <em>more narrowly tailored</em> than the race-conscious admission plans that this Court approved in <em>Grutter</em>.  Here, race becomes a factor only in a fraction of students\xe2\x80\x99 non-merit-based assignments\xe2\x80\x94not in large numbers of students\xe2\x80\x99 merit-based applications.  Moreover, the effect of applying race-conscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged students <em>less</em> <em>severely, </em>not more severely, than the criteria at issue in <em>Grutter</em>.  Disappointed students are not rejected from a State\xe2\x80\x99s flagship graduate program; they simply attend a different one of the district\xe2\x80\x99s many public schools, which in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal.  Cf. <em>Wygant</em>, 476 U. S., at 283.  And, in Seattle, the disadvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school of his choice.  One will search <em>Grutter</em> in vain for similarly persuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school districts have presented here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the manner in which the school boards developed these plans itself reflects \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow tailoring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Each plan was devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools.  Each plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation.  Each plan is the product of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, while diminishing the need for mandatory busing.  And each plan\xe2\x80\x99s use of race-conscious elements is <em>diminished </em>compared to the use of race in preceding integration plans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The school boards\xe2\x80\x99 widespread consultation, their experimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-year history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans that are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve the board\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d objectives.  The history of each school system reveals highly segregated schools, followed by remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by efforts to attract or retain students through the use of plans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater student choice. Both cities once tried to achieve more integrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as redrawn district boundaries, new school building construction, and unrestricted voluntary transfers.  In neither city did these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the city\xe2\x80\x99s integration goals.  See Parts I\xe2\x80\x93A and I\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9318<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school board\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these particular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial scrutiny.  It simply recognizes that judges are not well suited to act as school administrators.  Indeed, in the context of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of acknowledging that local school boards better understand their own communities and have a better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the educational needs of their pupils.  See <em>Milliken</em>,<em> </em>418 U. S., at 741\xe2\x80\x9342 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process\xe2\x80\x9d).

In 1987, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights studied 125 large school districts seeking integration.  It reported that most districts\xe2\x80\x9492 of them, in fact\xe2\x80\x94adopted desegregation policies that combined two or more highly race-conscious strategies, for example, rezoning or pairing.  See Welch 83\xe2\x80\x9391.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having looked at dozens of <em>amicus</em> briefs, public reports, news stories, and the records in many of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases, which together span 50 years of desegregation history in school districts across the Nation, I have discovered many examples of districts that sought integration through explicitly race-conscious methods, including mandatory busing.  Yet, I have found <em>no</em> example or model that would permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville: \xe2\x80\x9cHere is an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely to achieve your objectives and also makes less use of race-conscious criteria than your plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, if the plurality cannot suggest such a model\xe2\x80\x94and it cannot\xe2\x80\x94then it seeks to impose a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow tailoring\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that in practice would never be met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are purely imagined, it is understandable why, as the plurality notes, <em>ante</em>, at 27, Seattle school officials concentrated on diminishing the racial component of their districts\xe2\x80\x99 plan, but did not pursue eliminating that element entirely.  For the plurality now to insist as it does, <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, that these school districts ought to have said so officially is either to ask for the superfluous (if they need only make explicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if they must somehow provide more proof that there is no hypothetical <em>other </em>plan that could work as well as theirs).  I am not aware of any case in which this Court has read the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow tailoring\xe2\x80\x9d test to impose such a requirement.  Cf. <em>People Who Care</em> v. <em>Rockford Bd. of Ed. School Dist. No. 205</em>, 961 F.\xc2\xa02d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be necessary to adjudicate the obvious\nbefore adopting (or permitting the parties to agree on) a remedy . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality also points to the school districts\xe2\x80\x99 use of numerical goals based upon the racial breakdown of the general school population, and it faults the districts for failing to prove that <em>no other set of numbers will work</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  The plurality refers to no case in support of its demand.  Nor is it likely to find such a case.  After all, this Court has in many cases explicitly permitted districts to use target ratios based upon the district\xe2\x80\x99s underlying population.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Swann</em>, 402 U. S., at 24\xe2\x80\x9325; <em>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</em>, 402 U. S., at 46; <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.</em>, 395 U. S., at 232.  The reason is obvious: In Seattle, where the overall student population is 41% white, permitting 85% white enrollment at a single school would make it much more likely that other schools would have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson County, with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85% white students would be less likely to skew enrollments elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there is research-based evidence supporting, for example, that a ratio no greater than 50% minority\xe2\x80\x94which is Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s starting point, and as close as feasible to Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s starting point\xe2\x80\x94is helpful in limiting the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite flight.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegregation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 121, 125.  Federal law also assumes that a similar target percentage will help avoid detrimental \xe2\x80\x9cminority group isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V, Part C, 115 Stat. 1806, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77231 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed., Supp. IV); 34 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing regulations).  What other numbers are the boards to use as a \xe2\x80\x9cstarting point\xe2\x80\x9d?  Are they to spend days, weeks, or months seeking independently to validate the use of ratios that this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases?  Are they to draw numbers out of thin air?  These districts have followed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings and advice in \xe2\x80\x9ctailoring\xe2\x80\x9d their plans.  That, too, strongly supports the lawfulness of their methods.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor could the school districts have accomplished their desired aims (<em>e.g.</em>, avoiding forced busing, countering white flight, maintaining racial diversity) by other means.  Nothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts over the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court, any reason to believe that another method is possible to accomplish these goals.  Nevertheless, Justice Kennedy suggests that school boards:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cmay pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at<em> </em>8.</p>\n<p align="left">But, as to \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic site selection,\xe2\x80\x9d Seattle has built one new high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized school serves only 300 students).  In fact, six of the Seattle high schools involved in this case were built by the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s; the other four were open by the early 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.  See generally N. Thompson &amp; C. Marr, Building for Learning: Seattle Public Schools Histories, 1862\xe2\x80\x932000 (2002).  As to \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing\xe2\x80\x9d neighborhood \xe2\x80\x9cattendance zones\xe2\x80\x9d on a racial basis, Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced busing was also part of the plan.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  As to \xe2\x80\x9callocating resources for special programs,\xe2\x80\x9d Seattle and Louisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these programs are often referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cmagnet schools,\xe2\x80\x9d but the limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at most to those few schools to which additional resources are granted.  In addition, there is no evidence from the experience of these school districts that it will make any meaningful impact.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93908, p. 42.  As to \xe2\x80\x9crecruiting faculty\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of race, both cities have tried, but only as one part of a broader program.  As to \xe2\x80\x9ctracking enrollments, performance and other statistics by race,\xe2\x80\x9d tracking <em>reveals </em>the problem; it does not cure it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy sets forth two additional concerns related to \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow tailoring.\xe2\x80\x9d  In respect to Louisville, he says first that officials stated (1) that kindergarten assignments are not subject to the race-conscious guidelines, and (2) that the child at issue here was denied permission to attend the kindergarten he wanted because of those guidelines.  Both, he explains, cannot be true.  He adds that this confusion illustrates that Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s assignment plan (or its explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently precise in respect to \xe2\x80\x9cwho makes the decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coversight,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise circumstances in which an assignment decision\xe2\x80\x9d will be made; and \xe2\x80\x9cwhich of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record suggests, however, that the child in question was not assigned to the school he preferred because he missed the kindergarten application deadline.  See App. in 05\xe2\x80\x93915, p. 20.  After he had enrolled and after the academic year had begun, he then applied to transfer to his preferred school after the kindergarten assignment deadline had passed, <em>id.</em>, at 21, possibly causing school officials to treat his late request as an application to transfer to the first grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply.  I am not certain just how the remainder of Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s concerns affect the lawfulness of the Louisville program, for they seem to be failures of explanation, not of administration.  But Louisville should be able to answer the relevant questions on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s second concern is directly related to the merits of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan: Why does Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s plan group Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans, and African-Americans together, treating all as similar minorities?  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The majority suggests that Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s classification system could permit a school to be labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdiverse\xe2\x80\x9d with a 50% Asian-American and 50% white student body, and no African-American students, Hispanic students, or students of other ethnicity.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6; <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (opinion of the Court).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 50/50 hypothetical has no support in the record here; it is conjured from the imagination.  In fact, Seattle apparently began to treat these different minority groups alike in response to the federal Emergency School Aid Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that it do so.  Siqueland 116\xe2\x80\x93117.  See also Hanawalt 31; Pub. L. 95\xe2\x80\x93561, Tit. VI (1978) (prescribing percentage enrollment requirements for \xe2\x80\x9cminority\xe2\x80\x9d students); Siqueland 55 (discussing HEW definition of \xe2\x80\x9cminority\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, maintaining this federally mandated system of classification makes sense insofar as Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s experience indicates that the relevant circumstances in respect to each of these different minority groups are roughly similar, <em>e.g.</em>, in terms of residential patterns, and call for roughly similar responses.  This is confirmed by the fact that Seattle has been able to achieve a desirable degree of diversity without the <em>greater</em> emphasis on race that drawing fine lines among minority groups would require.  Does the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view of the Equal Protection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to such a board determination?  Does it insist upon especially strong evidence supporting inclusion of multiple minority groups in an otherwise lawful government minority-assistance program?  If so, its interpretation threatens to produce divisiveness among minority groups that is incompatible with the basic objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Regardless, the plurality cannot object that the constitutional defect is the individualized use of race and simultaneously object that not enough account of individuals\xe2\x80\x99 race has been taken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish <em>Grutter</em> from these cases by claiming that <em>Grutter </em>arose in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the context of higher education.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  But that is not a meaningful legal distinction.  I have explained why I do not believe the Constitution could possibly find \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d the provision of a racially diverse education for a 23-year-old law student but not for a 13-year-old high school pupil.  See <em>supra</em>, at 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  And I have explained how the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than those in <em>Grutter</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 45.  I add that one cannot find a relevant distinction in the fact that these school districts did not examine the merits of applications \xe2\x80\x9cindividual[ly].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  The context here does not involve admission by merit; a child\xe2\x80\x99s academic, artistic, and athletic \xe2\x80\x9cmerits\xe2\x80\x9d are not at all relevant to the child\xe2\x80\x99s placement.  These are not affirmative action plans, and hence \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d is simply beside the point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that these plans\xe2\x80\x99 specific features\xe2\x80\x94(1) their limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2) their strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious elements, (3) their history and the manner in which the districts developed and modified their approach, (4) the comparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably evident alternatives\xe2\x80\x94together show that the districts\xe2\x80\x99 plans are \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to achieve their \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling\xe2\x80\x9d goals.  In sum, the districts\xe2\x80\x99 race-conscious plans satisfy \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d and are therefore lawful.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Direct Precedent</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two additional precedents more directly related to the plans here at issue reinforce my conclusion.  The first consists of the District Court determination in the Louisville case when it dissolved its desegregation order that there was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d indeed that the Board had \xe2\x80\x9ctreated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligation\xe2\x80\x94they consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hampton II</em>, 102 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 370.  When the court made this determination in 2000, it did so in the context of the Louisville desegregation plan that the board had adopted in 1996.  That plan, which took effect before 1996, is the very plan that in all relevant respects is in effect now and is the subject of the present challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s plan was unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it.  To the contrary, there is every reason to believe that it represented part of an effort to implement the 1978 desegregation order.  But if the plan was lawful when it was first adopted and if it was lawful the day before the District Court dissolved its order, how can the plurality now suggest that it became <em>unlawful</em> the following day?  Is it conceivable that the Constitution, implemented through a court desegregation order, could permit (perhaps <em>require</em>) the district to make use of a race-conscious plan the day before the order was dissolved and then <em>forbid</em> the district to use the identical plan the day after?  See <em>id., </em>at 380 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe very analysis for dissolving desegregation decrees supports continued maintenance of a desegregated system as a compelling state interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Equal Protection Clause is not incoherent.  And federal courts would rightly hesitate to find unitary status if the consequences of the ruling were so dramatically disruptive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/457/index.html">458 U. S. 457</a>, is directly on point.  That case involves the original Seattle Plan, a <em>more heavily race-conscious predecessor</em> of the very plan now before us.  In <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</em>, this Court struck down a state referendum that effectively barred implementation of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s desegregation plan and \xe2\x80\x9cburden[ed] all future attempts to integrate Washington schools in districts throughout the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 462\xe2\x80\x93463, 483.  Because the referendum would have prohibited the adoption of a school-integration plan that involved mandatory busing, and because it would have imposed a special burden on school integration plans (plans that sought to integrate previously segregated schools), the Court found it unconstitutional.  <em>Id</em>., at 483\xe2\x80\x93487.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly address the constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle plan.  But it explicitly cited <em>Swann</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>statement that the Constitution permitted a local district to adopt such a plan.  458 U. S., at 472, n.\xc2\xa015.  It also cited to Justice Powell\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Bakke</em>, <em>approving of</em> the limited use of race-conscious criteria in a university-admissions \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative action\xe2\x80\x9d case.  458 U. S., at 472, n. 15<em>.</em>  In addition, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ttending an ethnically diverse school,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 473, could help prepare \xe2\x80\x9cminority children for citizenship in our pluralistic society,\xe2\x80\x9d hopefully \xe2\x80\x9cteaching members of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to believe that the Court that held unconstitutional a referendum that would have interfered with the implementation of this plan thought that the integration plan it sought to preserve was itself an <em>unconstitutional </em>plan.  And if <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1 </em>is premised upon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is equally premised upon the constitutionality of the present plan, for the present plan <em>is </em>the Seattle Plan, modified only insofar as it places even <em>less </em>emphasis on race-conscious elements than its predecessors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is even more difficult to accept the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view, namely that the underlying plan was unconstitutional.  If that is so, then <em>all </em>of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s earlier (even more race-conscious) plans must also have been unconstitutional.  That necessary implication of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s position strikes the 13th chime of the clock.  How could the plurality adopt a constitutional standard that would hold unconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integration plans adopted by numerous school boards over the past 50 years while remaining true to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s desegregation precedent?</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Consequences</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical document that would transmit its basic values to future generations through principles that remained workable over time.  Hence it is important to consider the potential consequences of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach, as measured against the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s objectives. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To do so provides further reason to believe that the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach is legally unsound.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, consider the effect of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s views on the parties before us and on similar school districts throughout the Nation.  Will Louisville and all similar school districts have to return to systems like Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s initial 1956 plan, which did not consider race at all?  See supra</em>, at 12.  That initial 1956 plan proved ineffective.   Sixteen years into the plan, 14 of 19 middle and high schools remained almost totally white or almost totally black.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The districts\xe2\x80\x99 past and current plans are not unique.  They resemble other plans, promulgated by hundreds of local school boards, which have attempted a variety of desegregation methods that have evolved over time in light of experience.  A 1987 Civil Rights Commission Study of 125 school districts in the Nation demonstrated the breadth and variety of desegregation plans: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe [study] documents almost 300 desegregation plans that were implemented between 1961 and 1985. The degree of heterogeneity within these districts is immediately apparent. They are located in every region of the country and range in size from Las Cruces, New Mexico, with barely over 15,000 students attending 23 schools in 1968, to New York City, with more than one million students in 853 schools. The sample includes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs (<em>e.g.</em>, Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (<em>e.g.</em>, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and Raleigh County, West Virginia). It contains 34 countywide districts with central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit this description, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and a small number of consolidated districts (New Castle County, Delaware and Jefferson County, Kentucky).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe districts also vary in their racial compositions and levels of segregation. Initial plans were implemented in Mobile, Alabama and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and in a number of other southern districts in the face of total racial segregation. At the other extreme, Santa Clara, California had a relatively even racial distribution prior to its 1979 desegregation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for Harford County, Maryland, the district was 92 percent white. Compton, California, on the other hand, became over 99 percent black in the 1980s, while Buffalo, New York had a virtual 50\xe2\x80\x9350 split between white and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not surprising to find a large number of different desegregation strategies in a sample with this much variation.\xe2\x80\x9d Welch 23 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">A majority of these desegregation techniques explicitly considered a student\xe2\x80\x99s race.  See <em>id.</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9328.  Transfer plans, for example, allowed students to shift from a school in which they were in the racial majority to a school in which they would be in a racial minority.  Some districts, such as Richmond, California, and Buffalo, New York, permitted only \xe2\x80\x9cone-way\xe2\x80\x9d transfers, in which only black students attending predominantly black schools were permitted to transfer to designated receiver schools.  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.  Fifty-three of the 125 studied districts used transfers as a component of their plans.  <em>Id.,</em> at 83\xe2\x80\x9391.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have adopted policies that encourage or require local school districts to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice plans.  Eight of those States condition approval of transfers to another school or district on whether the transfer will produce increased racial integration.  Eleven other States require local boards to deny transfers that are\nnot in compliance with the local school board\xe2\x80\x99s desegre-\ngation plans.  See Education Commission of the States, Open Enrollment: 50-State Report (2007), online at http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=268.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arkansas, for example, provides by statute that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o student may transfer to a nonresident district where the percentage of enrollment for the student\xe2\x80\x99s race exceeds that percentage in the student\xe2\x80\x99s resident district.\xe2\x80\x9d Ark.

Code Ann. \xc2\xa73313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii) (Lexis Supp. 2006).

Another Connecticut regulation provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny school in which the Proportion for the School falls outside of a range from 25 percentage points less to 25 percentage points more than the Comparable Proportion for the School District, shall be determined to be racially imbalanced.\xe2\x80\x9d Conn. Agencies Regs. \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93226e\xe2\x80\x933(b) (1999).

See <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neill</em>, 238 Conn. 1, 678 A.\xc2\xa02d 1267 (1996).  The State Supreme Court wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cDespite the initiatives undertaken by the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among school districts, and despite the fact that the defendants did not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the disparities that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 42, 678 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1289.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a minimum, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s views would threaten a surge of race-based litigation.  Hundreds of state and federal statutes and regulations use racial classifications for educational or other purposes.  See <em>supra</em>, at 27.  In many such instances, the contentious force of legal challenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would displace earlier calm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The wide variety of different integration plans that school districts use throughout the Nation suggests that the problem of racial segregation in schools, including <em>de facto </em>segregation, is difficult to solve.  The fact that many such plans have used explicitly racial criteria suggests that such criteria have an important, sometimes necessary, role to play.  The fact that the controlling opinion would make a school district\xe2\x80\x99s use of such criteria often unlawful (and the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccolorblind\xe2\x80\x9d view would make such use always unlawful) suggests that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will require setting aside the laws of several States and many local communities.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have pointed out, <em>supra</em>, at 4, <em>de facto</em> resegregation is on the rise.  See Appendix A, <em>infra</em>.  It is reasonable to conclude that such resegregation can create serious educational, social, and civic problems.  See<em> supra,</em> at 37\xe2\x80\x9345.  Given the conditions in which school boards work to set policy, see <em>supra,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, they may need all of the means presently at their disposal to combat those problems.  Yet the plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that some districts now consider vital\xe2\x80\x94the limited use of broad race-conscious student population ranges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I use the words \xe2\x80\x9cmay need\xe2\x80\x9d here deliberately.  The plurality, or at least those who follow Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98color-blind\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d approach, see <em>ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>Grutter</em>, 539 U. S., at 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), may feel confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end <em>all</em> governmental use of race-conscious criteria including those with inclusive objectives.  See <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (plurality opinion); see also <em>ante</em>, at 26 (Thomas, J., concurring).  By way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems of increasing <em>de facto </em>segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and poverty correlated with race.  But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these problems.  Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers.  And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s children and how best to administer America\xe2\x80\x99s schools to achieve that aim.  The Court should leave them to their work.  And it is for them to decide, to quote the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s slogan, whether the best \xe2\x80\x9cway to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  See also <em>Parents Involved VII</em>, 426 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe way to end racial discrimination is to stop discriminating by race\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws invidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all use of race-conscious criteria.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the people, acting through their elected representatives, freedom to select the use of \xe2\x80\x9crace-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d criteria from among their available options.  See <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em>, 515 U. S., at 237 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]trict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d in this context is \xe2\x80\x9c[not] \xe2\x80\x98strict in theory, but fatal in fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Fullilove</em>, 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment))).  Today, however, the Court restricts (and some Members would eliminate) that leeway.  I fear the consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to create, out of its diversity, one Nation.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Conclusions</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To show that the school assignment plans here meet the requirements of the Constitution, I have written at exceptional length.  But that length is necessary.  I cannot refer to the history of the plans in these cases to justify the use of race-conscious criteria without describing that history in full.  I cannot rely upon Swann</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>statement that the use of race-conscious limits is permissible without showing, rather than simply asserting, that the statement represents a constitutional principle firmly rooted in federal and state law.  Nor can I explain my disagreement with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding and the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, without offering a detailed account of the arguments they propound and the consequences they risk.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is long.  But its conclusion is short: The plans before us satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.  And it is the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, not this dissent that \xe2\x80\x9cfails to ground the result it would reach in law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four basic considerations have led me to this view.  <em>First</em>, the histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal complex circumstances and a long tradition of conscientious efforts by local school boards to resist racial segregation in public schools.  Segregation at the time of <em>Brown</em> gave way to expansive remedies that included busing, which in turn gave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation.  For decades now, these school boards have considered and adopted and revised assignment plans that sought to rely less upon race, to emphasize greater student choice, and to improve the conditions of all schools for all students, no matter the color of their skin, no matter where they happen to reside.  The plans under review\xe2\x80\x94which are less burdensome, more egalitarian, and more effective than prior plans\xe2\x80\x94continue in that tradition.  And their history reveals school district goals whose remedial, educational, and democratic elements are inextricably intertwined each with the others.  See Part I, <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em><f f="Century Schoolbook">Second</f></em>, since this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Brown</em>, the law has consistently and unequivocally approved of both voluntary and compulsory race-conscious measures to combat segregated schools.  The Equal Protection Clause, ratified following the Civil War, has always distinguished in practice between state action that excludes and thereby subordinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to bring together people of all races.  From <em>Swann </em>to <em>Grutter</em>, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have emphasized this distinction, recognizing that the fate of race relations in this country depends upon unity among our children, \xe2\x80\x9cfor unless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Milliken</em>, 418 U. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  See also C. Sumner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Separate Colored Schools in Massachusetts, in 2 The Works of Charles Sumner 327, 371 (1849) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe law contemplates not only that all be taught, but that all shall be taught together\xe2\x80\x9d).  See Part II, <em>supra</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial review, are supported by compelling state interests and are narrowly tailored to accomplish those goals.  Just as diversity in higher education was deemed compelling in <em>Grutter</em>, diversity in public primary and secondary schools\xe2\x80\x94where there is even more to gain\xe2\x80\x94must be, <em>a fortiori</em>, a compelling state interest.  Even apart from <em>Grutter</em>, five Members of this Court agree that \xe2\x80\x9cavoiding racial isolation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cachiev[ing] a diverse student population\xe2\x80\x9d remain today compelling interests.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  These interests combine remedial, educational, and democratic objectives.  For the reasons discussed above, however, I disagree with Justice Kennedy that Seattle and Louisville have not done enough to demonstrate that their present plans are necessary to continue upon the path set by <em>Brown</em>.  These plans are <em>more</em> \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d than the race-conscious law school admissions criteria at issue in <em>Grutter</em>.  Hence, their lawfulness follows <em>a fortiori </em>from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.  See Parts III\xe2\x80\x93IV, <em>supra</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9357.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth</em>, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach risks serious harm to the law and for the Nation.  Its view of the law rests either upon a denial of the distinction between exclusionary and inclusive use of race-conscious criteria in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, or upon such a rigid application of its \xe2\x80\x9ctest\xe2\x80\x9d that the distinction loses practical significance.  Consequently, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today slows down and sets back the work of local school boards to bring about racially diverse schools.  See Part V, <em>supra</em>, at 57\xe2\x80\x9363.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court takes today are serious.  Yesterday, the plans under review were lawful.  Today, they are not.  Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous pronouncements concerning desegregation.  Today, they cannot.  Yesterday, school boards had available to them a full range of means to combat segregated schools.  Today, they do not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision undermines other basic institutional principles as well.  What has happened to <em>stare decisis?</em>  The history of the plans before us, their educational importance, their highly limited use of race\xe2\x80\x94all these and more\xe2\x80\x94make clear that the compelling interest here is stronger than in <em>Grutter</em>.  The plans here are more narrowly tailored than the law school admissions program there at issue.  Hence, applying <em>Grutter</em>\xe2\x80\x99s strict test, their lawfulness follows <em>a fortiori</em>.  To hold to the contrary is to transform that test from \xe2\x80\x9cstrict\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cfatal in fact\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the very opposite of what <em>Grutter</em> said.  And what has happened to <em>Swann?</em>  To <em>McDaniel?</em>  To <em>Crawford?</em>  To <em>Harris?</em>  To <em>School Committee of Boston?</em>  To <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1?</em>  After decades of vibrant life, they would all, under the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s logic, be written out of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking by States and school boards?  For several decades this Court has rested its public school decisions upon <em>Swann</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>basic view that the Constitution grants local school districts a significant degree of leeway where the inclusive use of race-conscious criteria is at issue.  Now localities will have to cope with the difficult problems they face (including resegregation) deprived of one means they may find necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what of law\xe2\x80\x99s concern to diminish and peacefully settle conflict among the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s people?  Instead of accommodating different good-faith visions of our country and our Constitution, today\xe2\x80\x99s holding upsets settled expectations, creates legal uncertainty, and threatens to produce considerable further litigation, aggravating race-related conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what of the long history and moral vision that the Fourteenth Amendment itself embodies?  The plurality cites in support those who argued in <em>Brown</em> against segregation, and Justice Thomas likens the approach that I have taken to that of segregation\xe2\x80\x99s defenders.  See <em>ante</em>, at 39\xe2\x80\x9341 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim Crow segregation to Seattle and Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s integration polices); <em>ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9332 (Thomas, J., concurring).  But segregation policies did not simply tell schoolchildren \xe2\x80\x9cwhere they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 40 (plurality opinion); they perpetuated a caste system rooted in the institutions of slavery and 80 years of legalized subordination.  The lesson of history, see <em>ante</em>, at 39 (plurality opinion), is not that efforts to continue racial segregation are constitutionally indistinguishable from efforts to achieve racial integration.  Indeed, it is a cruel distortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s to Louisville and Seattle in the modern day\xe2\x80\x94to equate the plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to attend a Jim Crow school) to the circumstances of Joshua McDonald (whose request to transfer to a school closer to home was initially declined).  This is not to deny that there is a cost in applying \xe2\x80\x9ca state-mandated racial label.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But that cost does not approach, in degree or in kind, the terrible harms of slavery, the resulting caste system, and 80 years of legal racial segregation.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, what of the hope and promise of <em>Brown?</em>  For much of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the races remained divided.  It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools.  In this Court\xe2\x80\x99s finest hour, <em>Brown </em>v.<em> Board of Education</em> challenged this history and helped to change it.  For <em>Brown </em>held out a promise.  It was a promise embodied in three Amendments designed to make citizens of slaves.  It was the promise of true racial equality\xe2\x80\x94not as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s cities and schools.  It was about the nature of a democracy that must work for all Americans.  It sought one law, one Nation, one people, not simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of how we actually live.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not everyone welcomed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Brown</em>.  Three years after that decision was handed down, the Governor of Arkansas ordered state militia to block the doors of a white schoolhouse so that black children could not enter.  The President of the United States dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and federal troops were needed to enforce a desegregation decree.  See <em>Cooper </em>v.<em> Aaron</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/1/index.html">358 U. S. 1</a> (1958).  Today, almost 50 years later, attitudes toward race in this Nation have changed dramatically.  Many parents, white and black alike, want their children to attend schools with children of different races.  Indeed, the very school districts that once spurned integration now strive for it.  The long history of their efforts reveals the complexities and difficulties they have faced.  And in light of those challenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands the instruments they have used to rid their schools of racial segregation, instruments that they believe are needed to overcome the problems of cities divided by race and poverty.  The plurality would decline their modest request.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality is wrong to do so.  The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise of <em>Brown</em>.  To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of <em>Brown</em>.  The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s position, I fear, would break that promise.  This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I must dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF <font caps="1">Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1">Resegregation Trends</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\nPercentage of Black Students in 90\xe2\x80\x93100 Percent Nonwhite and Majority Nonwhite Public Schools by Region, 1950\xe2\x80\x931954 to 2000, Fall Enrollment</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1"><f f="Century Schoolbook">Region</f></font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n1950\xe2\x80\x931954</p>\n<p>\n\n1960\xe2\x80\x931961</p>\n<p>\n\n1968</p>\n<p>\n\n1972</p>\n<p>\n\n1976</p>\n<p>\n\n1980</p>\n<p>\n\n1989</p>\n<p>\n\n1999</p>\n<p>\n\n2000</p>\n<p>\n\nPercentage in 90\xe2\x80\x93100% Nonwhite Schools</p>\n<p>\n\nNortheast</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n40</p>\n<p>\n\n42.7</p>\n<p>\n\n46.9</p>\n<p>\n\n51.4</p>\n<p>\n\n48.7</p>\n<p>\n\n49.8</p>\n<p>\n\n50.2</p>\n<p>\n\n51.2</p>\n<p>\n\nBorder</p>\n<p>\n\n100</p>\n<p>\n\n59</p>\n<p>\n\n60.2</p>\n<p>\n\n54.7</p>\n<p>\n\n42.5</p>\n<p>\n\n37.0</p>\n<p>\n\n33.7</p>\n<p>\n\n39.7</p>\n<p>\n\n39.6</p>\n<p>\n\nSouth</p>\n<p>\n\n100</p>\n<p>\n\n100</p>\n<p>\n\n77.8</p>\n<p>\n\n24.7</p>\n<p>\n\n22.4</p>\n<p>\n\n23.0</p>\n<p>\n\n26.0</p>\n<p>\n\n31.1</p>\n<p>\n\n30.9</p>\n<p>\n\nMidwest</p>\n<p>\n\n53</p>\n<p>\n\n56</p>\n<p>\n\n58.0</p>\n<p>\n\n57.4</p>\n<p>\n\n51.1</p>\n<p>\n\n43.6</p>\n<p>\n\n40.1</p>\n<p>\n\n45.0</p>\n<p>\n\n46.3</p>\n<p>\n\nWest</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n27</p>\n<p>\n\n50.8</p>\n<p>\n\n42.7</p>\n<p>\n\n36.3</p>\n<p>\n\n33.7</p>\n<p>\n\n26.7</p>\n<p>\n\n29.9</p>\n<p>\n\n29.5</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">U.

S. 294</a> (1955).  The first sentence in the concluding paragraph of his opinion states: \xe2\x80\x9cBefore <em>Brown,</em> schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 40.  This sentence reminds me of Anatole France\xe2\x80\x99s observation: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he majestic equality of the la[w], forbid[s] rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Chief Justice fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In this and other ways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s most important decisions.  Compare <em>ante,</em> at 39 (\xe2\x80\x9chistory will be heard\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Quarterman,</em> 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 11) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a familiar adage that history is written by the victors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice rejects the conclusion that the racial classifications at issue here should be viewed differently than others, because they do not impose burdens on one race alone and do not stigmatize or exclude.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The only justification for refusing to acknowledge the obvious importance of that difference is the citation of a few recent opinions\xe2\x80\x94none of which even approached unanimity\xe2\x80\x94grandly proclaiming that all racial classifications must be analyzed under \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 227 (1995).  Even today, two of our wisest federal judges have rejected such a wooden reading of the Equal Protection Clause in the context of school integration.  See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193\xe2\x80\x931196 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring); <em>Comfort</em> v. <em>Lynn School Comm.,</em> 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 27\xe2\x80\x9329 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s misuse of the three-tiered approach to Equal Protection analysis merely reconfirms my own view that there is only one such Clause in the Constitution.  See <em>Craig</em> v. <em>Boren</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/index.html">429 U. S. 190</a>, 211 (1976) (concurring opinion).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we look at cases decided during the interim between <em>Brown</em> and <em>Adarand,</em> we can see how a rigid adherence to tiers of scrutiny obscures <em>Brown</em>\xe2\x80\x99s clear message.  Perhaps the best example is provided by our approval of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1967 upholding a state statute mandating racial integration in that State\xe2\x80\x99s school system.  See <em>School Comm. of Boston</em> v. <em>Board of Education, </em>352 Mass. 693,<em> </em>227 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 729.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Rejecting arguments comparable to those that the plurality accepts today,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] that court noted: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be the height of irony if the racial imbalance act, enacted as it was with the laudable purpose of achieving equal educational opportunities, should, by prescribing school pupil allocations based on race, founder on unsuspected shoals in the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 698, 227 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 733 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invoking our mandatory appellate jurisdiction,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the Boston plaintiffs prosecuted an appeal in this Court.  Our ruling on the merits simply stated that the appeal was \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>School Comm. of Boston</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/572/index.html"></a><a href="/us/389/572/index.html">389 U. S. 572</a> (1968) <em>(per curiam).</em>  That decision not only expressed our appraisal of the merits of the appeal, but it constitutes a precedent that the Court overrules today.  The subsequent statements by the unanimous Court in <em>Swann</em> v. <em>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/index.html">402 U. S. 1</a>, 16 (1971), by then-Justice Rehnquist in chambers in <em>Bustop, Inc.</em> v. <em>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/1380/index.html">439 U.

Unlike today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, they were also entirely loyal to <em>Brown.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has changed significantly since it decided <em>School Comm. of Boston</em> in 1968.  It was then more faithful to <em>Brown</em> and more respectful of our precedent than it is today.  It is my firm conviction that no Member of the Court that I joined in 1975 would have agreed with today\xe2\x80\x99s decision. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Le Lys Rouge (The Red Lily) 95 (W.

Wilkinson, From <em>Brown</em> to <em>Bakke</em> 11 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone understands that <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> helped deliver the Negro from over three centuries of legal bondage\xe2\x80\x9d); Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 421, 424\xe2\x80\x93425 (\xe2\x80\x9cHistory, too, tells us that segregation was imposed on one race by the other race; consent was not invited or required.  Segregation in the South grew up and is kept going because and only because the white race has wanted it that way\xe2\x80\x94an incontrovertible fact which itself hardly consorts with equality\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I have long adhered to the view that a decision to exclude a member of a minority because of his race is fundamentally different from a decision to include a member of a minority for that reason.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/200/index.html">515 U.

S. 267</a>, 316 (1986) (same).  This distinction is critically important in the context of education.  While the focus of our opinions is often on the benefits that minority schoolchildren receive from an integrated education, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 15 (Thomas, J., concurring), children of <em>all</em> races benefit from integrated classrooms and playgrounds, see <em>Wygant</em>, 476 U. S., at 316 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he fact that persons of different races do, indeed, have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons.  The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice twice cites my dissent in <em>Fullilove</em> v. <em>Klutznick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/448/index.html">448 U. S. 448</a> (1980).  See <em>ante</em>, at 12, 23.  In that case, I stressed the importance of confining a remedy for <em>past</em> wrongdoing to the members of the injured class.  See 448 U. S., at 539.  The present cases, unlike <em>Fullilove</em> but like our decision in <em>Wygant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/476/267/index.html">476 U. S. 267</a>, require us to \xe2\x80\x9cask whether the Board[s\xe2\x80\x99] actions[s] advanc[e] the public interest in educating children for the <em>future</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 313 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).  See <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, it is not necessary to find that the Board of Education has been guilty of racial discrimination in the past to support the conclusion that it has a legitimate interest in employing more black teachers in the future\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Adarand, </em>515 U. S., at 261\xe2\x80\x93262 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis program, then, if in part a remedy for past discrimination, is most importantly a forward-looking response to practical problems faced by minority subcontractors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice states that the Massachusetts racial imbalance Act did not require express classifications.  See <em>ante</em>, at 31-32, n.\xc2\xa016.  This is incorrect.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court expressly stated:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe racial imbalance act requires the school committee of every municipality annually to submit statistics showing the percentage of nonwhite pupils in all public schools and in each school.  Whenever the board finds that racial imbalance exists in a public school, it shall give written notice to the appropriate school committee, which shall prepare a plan to eliminate imbalance and file a copy with the board.  \xe2\x80\x98The term \xe2\x80\x9cracial imbalance\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a ratio between nonwhite and other students in public schools which is sharply out of balance with the racial composition of the society in which nonwhite children study, serve and work.  For the purpose of this section, racial imbalance shall be deemed to exist when the per cent of nonwhite students in any public school is in excess of fifty per cent of the total number of students in such school.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  352 Mass., at 695, 227 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 731.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Compare <em>ante</em>, at 39 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954\xe2\x80\x9d), with Juris.
