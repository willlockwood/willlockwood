Thomas Maney, one of the plaintiffs in error, on 4 October, 1836, gave his note to the defendant in error, for $5,000, payable eight months after date.  Suit was afterwards brought on this note, and judgment recovered in the state circuit court, from which Maney appealed to the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed against him.</p>\n<p>He then filed his bill in the chancery court, and obtained an injunction.  The defendant in error answered, and upon the hearing the injunction was dissolved and the bill dismissed, and this decree was affirmed in the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals against the said Maney and the other plaintiffs in error, who were his securities in the appeal bond.  It is from the last mentioned decree that the present writ of error was brought.</p>\n<p>In order to understand the character of the controversy in the state court and the points in issue between parties, it is proper to state that by the 14th article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians, made at Dancing Rabbit Creek on 27 September, 1830, it was stipulated that each Choctaw head of a family being desirous to remain and become a citizen of the states should be permitted to do so by signifying his intention to the agent of the United States within six months from the ratification of the treaty, and should thereupon become entitled to a reservation of one section of 640 acres, to be bounded by sectional lines -- one-half that quantity for each unmarried child living with him over ten years of age -- and a quarter section for each child under ten, to adjoin the location of the parent.  And if they resided on such land intending to become citizens five years after the ratification of the treaty, a grant in fee simple was to issue, the reservation to include the improvement held by the head of the family at the time of the treaty, or a portion of it.</p>\n<p>The bill filed by Maney stated that in December, 1835, the defendant informed him that many Indians had within the time prescribed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 45 U.

CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Upon examining the bill in this case, it is not easy to determine, from the loose manner in which it is drawn, whether the complainant claimed the relief he asked for on the ground that the representations made to him by the defendant were false and fraudulent or on the ground that the consideration for which the note was given had failed, because the defendant was unable to convey him a title to the Indian reservations.</p>\n<p>It is evident, however, that the suit was not brought to uphold </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 45 U. S. 58</a></p><p> any title or right which the complainant claimed under the Choctaw treaty, or under the law of Congress which he states to have been passed upon the subject.  For he does not ask for a conveyance of the reservations, nor of the Indian title to them.  And he does not even aver that these claims are valid or that he has any title to them, but, on the contrary, charges that none of the claims had been secured and states that he did not think it probable that they would be obtained by the assignees of the Indians.  And as the case has been removed here from the decision of a state court, we have no right to review it unless the complainant claimed some right under the treaty with the Choctaws or the act of Congress, and the decision of the state court had been against the right, title, or privilege specially set up by him, and even in that case, the power of revision given to this Court extends no further than to the particular question thus raised and decided against the party.  In the case before us, no such title, right, or privilege was claimed by the bill, and of course no decision was made against it in the state court.  We therefore can exercise no jurisdiction in the case, and are not authorized to examine any questions of fraud or failure of consideration, or breach of contract, which the bill may be supposed to present and upon which the court of the State of Tennessee may now decide.</p>\n<p>Upon referring to the reports of this Court, it will be seen that the 25th section of the act of Congress of 1789, under which this writ of error is brought, has been often the subject of examination and comment in this Court, and the construction of the section and the practice under it well settled by many decisions.  It is unnecessary to repeat here what the Court has said upon former occasions.  It is very clear that this case is not within the provisions of the section, and the writ of error must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
