In contrast, a law permitting communication in a certain manner for some, but not for others, raises the danger of content and viewpoint censorship, which is at its zenith when the determination of who may speak and who may not is left to an official\'s unbridled discretion.  Even if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular manner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining a license from an official in that official\'s boundless discretion.

S. 753</a></p><p> for the Sixth Circuit enjoining enforcement of its local ordinance regulating the placement of newsracks.  The court\'s decision was based in part on its conclusion that the ordinance vests the Mayor with unbridled discretion over which publishers may place newsracks on public property and where.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Prior to 1983, the city of Lakewood absolutely prohibited the private placement of any structure on public property.  On the strength of that law, the city denied the Plain Dealer Publishing Company (Newspaper) permission to place its coin-operated newspaper dispensing devices on city sidewalks.  In response, the Newspaper brought suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio challenging the ordinance.  The District Court adjudged the absolute prohibition unconstitutional, but delayed entering a permanent injunction to give the city time to amend its law.</p>\n<p>Although the city could have appealed the District Court\'s judgment, it decided instead to adopt two ordinances permitting the placement of structures on city property under certain conditions.  One of those ordinances specifically concerns newsracks.  \xc2\xa7 901.181, Codified Ordinances, City of Lakewood (1984). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  That ordinance gives the Mayor the authority to grant or deny applications for annual newsrack permits.  If the Mayor denies an application, he is required to "stat[e] the reasons for such denial."  In the event the Mayor grants an application, the city issues an annual permit subject to several terms and conditions.  Among them are:  (1) approval of the newsrack design by the city\'s Architectural Board of Review; (2) an agreement by the newsrack owner to indemnify the city against any liability arising from the newsrack, guaranteed by a $100,000 insurance policy to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 486 U. S. 754</a></p><p> that effect; and (3) any "other terms and conditions deemed necessary and reasonable by the Mayor." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Dissatisfied with the new ordinance, the Newspaper elected not to seek a permit, and instead amended its complaint in the District Court to challenge facially the law as amended.  The District Court found the ordinance constitutional in its entirety, and entered judgment in the city\'s favor. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="755">Page 486 U. S. 755</a></p><p>  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional in three respects.  First, it held that the ordinance gives the Mayor unbounded discretion to grant or deny a permit application and to place unlimited additional terms and conditions on any permit that issues.  Second, it concluded that, in the absence of any express standards governing newsrack design, the design approval requirement effectively gives the Board unbridled discretion to deny applications.  Finally, a majority of the panel decided that the indemnity and insurance requirements for newsrack owners violate the First Amendment because no similar burdens are placed on owners of other structures on public property. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The court found that the foregoing provisions of the law were not severable, and therefore held the entire ordinance unconstitutional insofar as it regulates newsracks in commercial districts.

And these evils engender identifiable risks to free expression that can be effectively alleviated only through a facial challenge.  First, the mere existence of the licensor\'s unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring their own speech, even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.  As we said in <em>Thornhill:</em></p>\n<p>"Proof of an abuse of power in the particular case has never been deemed a requisite for attack on the constitutionality of a statute purporting to license the dissemination of ideas. . . .  The power of the licensor against which John Milton directed his assault by his \'Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing\' is pernicious not merely by reason of the censure of particular comments, but by the reason of the <em>threat to censure comments on matters of public concern.</em>  It is not merely the sporadic abuse of power by the censor, <em>but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existence that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion.</em>"</p>\n<p>310 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/case.html#97">310 U. S. 97</a></span> (emphases added).  <em>See also Freedman, supra.</em>  Self-censorship is immune to an "as applied" challenge, for it derives from the individual\'s own actions, not an abuse of government power.  It is not difficult to visualize a newspaper that relies to a substantial degree on single issue sales feeling significant pressure to endorse the incumbent Mayor in an upcoming election, or to refrain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 486 U. S. 758</a></p><p> from criticizing him, in order to receive a favorable and speedy disposition on its permit application.  Only standards limiting the licensor\'s discretion will eliminate this danger by adding an element of certainty fatal to self-censorship.  <em>Cf. Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/case.html">455 U. S. 489</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/case.html#498">455 U. S. 498</a></span> (1982) (vagueness doctrine).  And only a facial challenge can effectively test the statute for these standards.</p>\n<p>Second, the absence of express standards makes it difficult to distinguish, "as applied," between a licensor\'s legitimate denial of a permit and its illegitimate abuse of censorial power.  Standards provide the guideposts that check the licensor and allow courts quickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is discriminating against disfavored speech.  Without these guideposts, <em>post hoc</em> rationalizations by the licensing official and the use of shifting or illegitimate criteria are far too easy, making it difficult for courts to determine in any particular case whether the licensor is permitting favorable, and suppressing unfavorable, expression.  <em>See, e.g., Joseph H. Munson Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/947/case.html#964">467 U. S. 964</a></span>, n. 12; <em>Cox v. Louisiana, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/536/case.html#557">379 U. S. 557</a></span>.  Further, the difficulty and delay inherent in the "as applied" challenge can itself discourage litigation.  A newspaper espousing an unpopular viewpoint on a shoestring budget may be the likely target for a retaliatory permit denial, but may not have the time or financial means to challenge the licensor\'s action.  That paper might instead find it easier to capitulate to what it perceives to be the Mayor\'s preferred viewpoint, or simply to close up shop.  Even if that struggling paper were willing and able to litigate the case successfully, the eventual relief may be "too little and too late."  Until a judicial decree to the contrary, the licensor\'s prohibition stands.  In the interim, opportunities for speech are irretrievably lost.  <em>Freedman,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#57">380 U.

In sum, without standards to fetter the licensor\'s discretion, the difficulties of proof and the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 486 U. S. 759</a></p><p> case-by-case nature of "as applied" challenges render the licensor\'s action in large measure effectively unreviewable.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The foregoing concepts form the heart of our test to distinguish laws that are vulnerable to facial challenge from those that are not.  As discussed above, we have previously identified two major First Amendment risks associated with unbridled licensing schemes:  self-censorship by speakers in order to avoid being denied a license to speak, and the difficulty of effectively detecting, reviewing, and correcting content-based censorship "as applied" without standards by which to measure the licensor\'s action.  It is when statutes threaten these risks to a significant degree that courts must entertain an immediate facial attack on the law.  Therefore, a facial challenge lies whenever a licensing law gives a government official or agency substantial power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or disliked speakers.  This is not to say that the press or a speaker may challenge as censorship any law involving discretion to which it is subject.  The law must have a close enough nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression, to pose a real and substantial threat of the identified censorship risks.</p>\n<p>The regulatory scheme in the present case contains two features which, at least in combination, justify the allowance of a facial challenge.  First, Lakewood\'s ordinance requires that the Newspaper apply annually for newsrack licenses.  Thus, it is the sort of system in which an individual must apply for multiple licenses over time, or periodically renew a license.  When such a system is applied to speech, or to conduct commonly associated with speech, the licensor does not necessarily view the text of the words about to be spoken, but can measure their probable content or viewpoint by speech already uttered.  <em>See Saia v. New York, supra.</em>  A speaker in this position is under no illusion regarding the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 486 U. S. 760</a></p><p> effect of the "licensed" speech on the ability to continue speaking in the future.  Yet demonstrating the link between "licensed" expression and the denial of a later license might well prove impossible.  While perhaps not as direct a threat to speech as a regulation allowing a licensor to view the actual content of the speech to be licensed or permitted, <em>see Freedman, supra; Cox v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/536/case.html">379 U. S. 536</a></span> (1965); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/58/case.html">372 U. S. 58</a></span> (1963), a multiple or periodic licensing requirement is sufficiently threatening to invite judicial concern.</p>\n<p>A second feature of the licensing system at issue here is that it is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 486 U. S. 761</a></p><p> associated with expression:  the circulation of newspapers.  Such a framework creates an agency or establishes an official charged particularly with reviewing speech, or conduct commonly associated with it, breeding an "expertise" tending to favor censorship over speech.  <em>Freedman, supra.</em>  Indeed, a law requiring the licensing of printers has historically been declared the archetypal censorship statute.  <em>See</em> 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *152.  Here again, without standards to bound the licensor, speakers denied a license will have no way of proving that the decision was unconstitutionally motivated, and, faced with that prospect, they will be pressured to conform their speech to the licensor\'s unreviewable preference.</p>\n<p>Because of these features in the regulatory system at issue here, we think that a facial challenge is appropriate, and that standards controlling the Mayor\'s discretion must be required.  Of course, the city may require periodic licensing, and may even have special licensing procedures for conduct commonly associated with expression; but the Constitution requires that the city establish neutral criteria to insure that the licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the type of law at issue in this case, laws of general application that are not aimed at conduct commonly associated with expression and do not permit licensing determinations to be made on the basis of ongoing expression or the words about to be spoken, carry with them little danger of censorship.  For example, a law requiring building permits is rarely effective as a means of censorship.  To be sure, on rare occasion, an opportunity for censorship will exist, such as when an unpopular newspaper seeks to build a new plant.  But such laws provide too blunt a censorship instrument to warrant judicial intervention prior to an allegation of actual misuse.  And if such charges are made, the general application of the statute to areas unrelated to expression will provide the courts a yardstick with which to measure the licensor\'s occasional speech-related decision.</p>\n<p>The foregoing discussion explains why the dissent\'s analogy between newspapers and soda vendors is inapposite.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#788">486 U. S. 788</a></span>-789.  Newspapers are in the business of expression, while soda vendors are in the business of selling soft drinks.  Even if the soda vendor engages in speech, that speech is not related to the soda; therefore preventing it from installing its machines may penalize unrelated speech, but will not directly prevent that speech from occurring.  In sum, a law giving the Mayor unbridled discretion to decide which soda vendors may place their machines on public property does not vest him with frequent opportunities to exercise substantial power over the content or viewpoint of the vendor\'s speech by suppressing the speech or directly controlling the vendor\'s ability to speak.</p>\n<p>The proper analogy is between newspapers and leaflets.  It is settled that leafletters may facially challenge licensing laws.  <em>See e.g., Talley v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/60/case.html">362 U. S. 60</a></span> (1960); <em>Lovell v. Griffin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/case.html">303 U. S. 444</a></span> (1938).  This settled law is based on the accurate premise that peaceful pamphleteering "is not fundamentally different from the function of a newspaper."  <em>Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html">402 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/415/case.html#419">402 U. S. 419</a></span> (1971); <em>see also Lovell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/case.html#450">303 U. S. 450</a></span>-452.  The dissent\'s theory therefore would turn the law on its head.  That </p><p><a class="page-number" name="762">Page 486 U. S. 762</a></p><p> result cannot be justified by relying on the meaningless distinction that, here, the newspapers are ultimately distributed by a machine, rather than by hand.  First, the ordinance held invalid in <em>Lovell</em> applied to distribution "by hand or otherwise."  303 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/case.html#447">303 U. S. 447</a></span>.  The Court did not even consider holding the law invalid only as to distribution by hand.  Second, such a distinction makes no sense in logic or theory.  The effectiveness of the newsrack as a means of distribution, especially for low-budget, controversial neighborhood newspapers, means that the twin threats of self-censorship and undetectable censorship are, if anything, greater for newsracks than for pamphleteers.  <em>Cf. Schneider v. State,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/147/case.html">308 U. S. 147</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/147/case.html#164">308 U. S. 164</a></span> (1939) (relying on the effectiveness of pamphleteering); <em>Martin v. Struthers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html">319 U. S. 141</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html#145">319 U. S. 145</a></span>-146 (1943) (same).</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>In an analysis divorced from a careful examination of the unique risks associated with censorship just discussed and their relation to the law before us, the dissent reasons that, if a particular manner of speech may be prohibited entirely, then no "activity protected by the First Amendment" can be implicated by a law imposing less than a total prohibition.  It then finds that a total ban on newsracks would be constitutional.  Therefore, the dissent concludes, the actual ordinance at issue involves no "activity protected by the First Amendment," and thus is not subject to facial challenge.  However, that reasoning is little more than a legal sleight-of-hand, misdirecting the focus of the inquiry from a law allegedly vesting unbridled censorship discretion in a government official toward one imposing a blanket prohibition. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The key to the dissent\'s analysis is its "greater-includes-the-lesser" syllogism.  But that syllogism is blind to the radically </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 486 U. S. 763</a></p><p> different constitutional harms inherent in the "greater" and "lesser" restrictions. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Presumably, in the case of an ordinance that completely prohibits a particular manner of expression, the law on its face is both content and viewpoint neutral.  In analyzing such a hypothetical ordinance, the Court would apply the well settled time, place, and manner test.  <em>E.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\'n of N.Y.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/case.html">447 U. S. 530</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/case.html#535">447 U. S. 535</a></span> (1980); <em>Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/92/case.html">408 U. S. 92</a></span> (1972).  The danger giving rise to the First Amendment inquiry is that the government is silencing or restraining a channel of speech; we ask whether some interest unrelated to speech justifies this silence.  To put it another way, the question is whether "the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time."  <em>Grayned v. Rockford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html">408 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html#116">408 U. S. 116</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p>In contrast, a law or policy permitting communication in a certain manner for some, but not for others, raises the specter of content and viewpoint censorship.  This danger is at its zenith when the determination of who may speak and who may not is left to the unbridled discretion of a government official.  As demonstrated above, we have often and uniformly held that such statutes or policies impose censorship on the public or the press, and hence are unconstitutional, because, without standards governing the exercise of discretion, a government official may decide who may speak and who may not based upon the content of the speech or viewpoint of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 486 U. S. 764</a></p><p> the speaker.  <em>E.g., Cox v. Louisiana,</em> 379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/536/case.html#557">379 U. S. 557</a></span>; <em>Staub,</em> 355 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/313/case.html#322">355 U. S. 322</a></span>.  Therefore, even if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular manner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining a license or permit from a government official in that official\'s boundless discretion.  It bears repeating that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n the area of freedom of expression, it is well established that one has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it delegates overly broad licensing discretion to an administrative office, whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly drawn statute, and whether or not he applied for a license."</p>\n<p><em>Freedman,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#56">380 U. S. 56</a></span>.  Fundamentally, then, the dissent\'s proposal ignores the different concerns animating our test to determine whether an expressive activity may be banned entirely, and our test to determine whether it may be licensed in an official\'s unbridled discretion.</p>\n<p>This point is aptly illustrated by a comparison of two of our prior cases:  <em>Saia v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html">334 U. S. 558</a></span> (1948), and <em>Kovacs v. Cooper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html">336 U. S. 77</a></span> (1949).  In <em>Saia,</em> this Court held that an ordinance prohibiting the use of sound trucks without permission from the Chief of Police was unconstitutional because the licensing official was able to exercise unbridled discretion in his decisionmaking, and therefore could, in a calculated manner, censor certain viewpoints.  Just seven months later, the Court held in <em>Kovacs</em> that a city could absolutely ban the use of sound trucks.  The plurality distinguished <em>Saia</em> precisely on the ground that, there, the ordinance constituted censorship by allowing some to speak, but not others; in <em>Kovacs,</em> the statute barred a particular manner of speech for all.  336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#80">336 U. S. 80</a></span> (plurality opinion of Reed, J.). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="765">Page 486 U. S. 765</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Saia</em> is irreconcilable with the logic the dissent now puts forward.  Under the dissent\'s novel rule, the Court in <em>Saia</em> should first have determined whether the use of sound trucks could be prohibited completely.  If so, as was held in <em>Kovacs,</em> the Court should have rejected the constitutional facial challenge. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="766">Page 486 U. S. 766</a></p><p>  No "activity protected by the First Amendment" (as the dissent defines it) would have been at issue. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The <em>Kovacs/Saia</em> comparison provides perhaps the clearest example of the flaw in the dissent\'s "greater-includes-the-lesser" reasoning.  However, in a host of other First Amendment cases, we have expressly or implicitly rejected that logic, and have considered on the merits facial challenges to statutes or policies that embodied discrimination based on the content or viewpoint of expression, or vested officials with open-ended discretion that threatened the same, even where it was assumed that a properly drawn law could have greatly restricted or prohibited the manner of expression or circulation at issue.</p>\n<p>For instance, in <em>Mosley</em> we considered an ordinance banning all picketing near a school <em>except</em> labor picketing.  The Court declared the law unconstitutional because the ordinance was sensitive to the content of the message.  Whether or not the picket could have been prohibited entirely was not dispositive of the Court\'s inquiry.  408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/92/case.html#96">408 U. S. 96</a></span>-99.  Similarly, in <em>Flower v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/197/case.html">407 U. S. 197</a></span> (1972), the Court summarily reversed a conviction based on Flower\'s return to a military facility to leaflet after having been ordered to leave once before.  It was never doubted that a military commander may generally restrict access to a military facility.  But, where the base was for all other purposes treated as part of the surrounding city, the Court refused to allow the commander unbridled discretion to prohibit Flower\'s leafletting.  In <em>Schacht v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/58/case.html">398 U. S. 58</a></span> (1970), the Court struck down a statute permitting actors to wear a military uniform in a theater or motion picture production </p><p><a class="page-number" name="767">Page 486 U. S. 767</a></p><p> only "if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force."  The Court noted that, although a total prohibition would be valid, a prohibition sensitive to the viewpoint of speech could not stand.  <em>Niemotko</em> provides yet another example of the Court\'s rejection of "greater-includes-the-lesser" logic in the First Amendment area.  There, a Jehovah\'s Witness was convicted of disorderly conduct after speaking in a park without a license.  The Court decided that, whatever power a city might have to prohibit all religious speech in its parks, it could not allow some, but not all, religious speech, depending on the exercise of unbridled discretion.  340 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#272">340 U. S. 272</a></span>-273.  Or, as Justice Frankfurter put it in his concurring opinion,</p>\n<p>"[a] licensing standard which gives an official authority to censor the content of speech differs <em>toto coelo</em> from one limited by its terms, or by nondiscriminatory practice, to considerations of public safety and the like."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#282">340 U. S. 282</a></span>.  <em>Cf. Widmar v. Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/case.html">454 U. S. 263</a></span> (1981) (public university need not create a public forum, but, having done so, it may not restrict access so as to exclude some groups based on the religious content of their speech without constitutional justification); <em>Madison Joint School District v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/167/case.html">429 U. S. 167</a></span> (1976) (School Board need not create a public forum, but, having done so, it cannot restrict who may speak based on the content or viewpoint of the speech).  To counter this unanimous line of authority, the dissent does not refer to a single case supporting its view that we cannot consider a facial challenge to an ordinance alleged to constitute censorship over constitutionally protected speech merely because the manner used to circulate that speech might be otherwise regulated or prohibited entirely.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, then, the dissent\'s reasoning must fall of its own weight.  As the preceding discussion demonstrates, this Court has long been sensitive to the special dangers inherent in a law placing unbridled discretion directly to license speech, or conduct commonly associated with speech, in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="768">Page 486 U. S. 768</a></p><p> hands of a government official.  In contrast, when the government is willing to prohibit a particular manner of speech entirely -- the speech it favors along with the speech it disfavors -- the risk of governmental censorship is simply not implicated.  The "greater" power of outright prohibition raises other concerns, and we have developed tests to consider them.  But we see no reason, and the dissent does not advance one, to ignore censorship dangers merely because other, unrelated concerns are satisfied.</p>\n<p>The dissent compounds its error by defining an "activity protected by the First Amendment" by the time, place, or (in this case) manner by which the activity is exercised.  The actual "activity" at issue here is the circulation of newspapers, which is constitutionally protected.  After all,</p>\n<p>"[l]iberty of circulating is as essential to [freedom of expression] as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be of little value."</p>\n<p><em>Ex parte Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/727/case.html">96 U. S. 727</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/727/case.html#733">96 U.

S. 452</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s recharacterization of the issue is not merely semantic; substituting the time, place, or manner for the activity itself allows the dissent to define away a host of activities commonly considered to be protected.  The right to demonstrate becomes the right to demonstrate at noise levels proscribed by law; the right to parade becomes the right to parade anywhere in the city 24 hours a day; and the right to circulate newspapers becomes the right to circulate newspapers by way of newsracks placed on public property.  Under the dissent\'s analysis, ordinances giving the Mayor unbridled discretion over whether to permit loud demonstrations or evening parades would not be vulnerable to a facial challenge, since they would not "requir[e] a license to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#777">486 U. S. 777</a></span>.  <em>But see Grayned,</em> 408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html#113">408 U. S. 113</a></span> (implying that a law banning excessively loud demonstrations was not facially invalid because its terms could not invite "subjective or discriminatory enforcement"). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 486 U. S. 769</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, we have never countenanced such linguistic prestidigitation, even where a regulation or total prohibition of the "manner" of speech has been upheld.  In determining whether expressive conduct is at issue in a censorship case, we do not look solely to the time, place, or manner of expression, but rather to whether the activity in question is commonly associated with expression.  For example, in <em>Kovacs,</em> it was never doubted that the First Amendment\'s protection of expression was implicated by the ordinance prohibiting sound trucks.  The Court simply concluded that the First Amendment was not abridged.  336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#87">336 U. S. 87</a></span>.  <em>See also City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html">466 U. S. 789</a></span> (1984).  So here, the First Amendment is certainly implicated by the city\'s circulation restriction; the question we must resolve is whether the First Amendment is abridged.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Having concluded that the Newspaper may facially challenge the Lakewood ordinance, we turn to the merits.  Section 901.181, Codified Ordinances, City of Lakewood, provides:</p>\n<p>"The Mayor shall either deny the application [for a permit], stating the reasons for such denial or grant said permit subject to the following terms. . . ."</p>\n<p>Section 901.181 (c) sets out some of those terms, including:  "(7) such other terms and conditions deemed necessary and reasonable by the Mayor."  It is apparent that the face of the ordinance itself contains no explicit limits on the Mayor\'s discretion.  Indeed, nothing in the law as written requires the Mayor to do more than make the statement "it is not in the public interest" when denying a permit application.  Similarly, the Mayor could grant the application, but require the newsrack to be placed in an inaccessible location without providing any explanation whatever.  To allow these illusory "constraints" to constitute the standards necessary to bound a licensor\'s discretion renders the guaranty against censorship little </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 486 U. S. 770</a></p><p> more than a high-sounding ideal.  <em>See Shuttlesworth,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html#150">394 U. S. 150</a></span>-151.</p>\n<p>The city asks us to presume that the Mayor will deny a permit application only for reasons related to the health, safety, or welfare of Lakewood citizens, and that additional terms and conditions will be imposed only for similar reasons.  This presumes the Mayor will act in good faith and adhere to standards absent from the statute\'s face.  But this is the very presumption that the doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion disallows.  <em>E.g., Freedman v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U. S. 51</a></span> (1965). The doctrine requires that the limits the city claims are implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative construction, or well established practice. <em>Poulos v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/395/case.html">345 U. S. 395</a></span> (1953); <em>Kunz v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/290/case.html">340 U. S. 290</a></span> (1951).  This Court will not write nonbinding limits into a silent statute. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 486 U. S. 771</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although the dissent disclaims a desire to pass upon the actual ordinance at issue, it apparently cannot resist making a few comments in this regard.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#793">486 U. S. 793</a></span>, n. 13.  First, it asserts that the ordinance\'s requirement that the Mayor state his reasons for denying a permit distinguishes this case from other licensing cases.  However, the Mayor\'s statement need not be made with any degree of specificity, nor are there any limits as to what reasons he may give.  Such a minimal requirement cannot provide the standards necessary to insure constitutional decisionmaking, nor will it, of necessity, provide a solid foundation for eventual judicial review.</p>\n<p>The dissent is also comforted by the availability of judicial review.  However, that review comes only after the Mayor and the City Council have denied the permit.  Nowhere in the ordinance is either body required to act with reasonable dispatch.  Rather, an application could languish indefinitely before the Council, with the Newspaper\'s only judicial remedy being a petition for mandamus.  <em>Cf.

This overstates the proposition.  We agree that, in some cases, there is exceptional force to the argument that a permit delayed is a permit denied.  However, we cannot agree that newspaper publishers can wait indefinitely for a permit only because there will always be news to report.  News is not fungible.  Some stories may be particularly well covered by certain publications, providing that newspaper with a unique opportunity to develop readership.

We need not resolve the remaining questions presented for review, as our conclusion regarding mayoral discretion will alone sustain the Court of Appeals\' judgment if these portions of the ordinance are not severable from the remainder.

It would be foolish indeed, and contrary to the federal courts\' declaratory judgment authorization, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201 (1982 ed., Supp. IV), to require the Newspaper to place a newsrack on city property illegally in order to obtain standing to challenge the ordinance.  <em>Cf.

It is true that, when a state law has been authoritatively construed so as to render it constitutional, or a well understood and uniformly applied practice has developed that has virtually the force of a judicial construction, the state law is read in light of those limits.  That rule applies even if the face of the statute might not otherwise suggest the limits imposed.  <em>Poulos v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/395/case.html">345 U. S. 395</a></span> (1953).  Further, this Court will presume any narrowing construction or practice to which the law is "fairly susceptible."  <em>Erznoznik v.

But we have never held that a federal litigant must await a state court construction or the development of an established practice before bringing the federal suit.  <em>Cf. Houston v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/451/case.html">482 U.

Facial attacks, by their nature, are not dependent on the facts surrounding any particular permit denial.  Thus, waiting for an alleged abuse before considering a facial challenge would achieve nothing except to allow the law to exist temporarily in a limbo of uncertainty, and to risk censorship of free expression during the interim.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O\'CONNOR join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the majority takes an extraordinary doctrine, developed cautiously by this Court over the past 50 years, and applies it to a circumstance, and in a manner, that is without precedent.  Because of this unwarranted expansion of our previous cases,  I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the outset, it is important to set forth the general nature of the dispute. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="773">Page 486 U. S. 773</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court quite properly does not establish any constitutional right of newspaper publishers to place newsracks on municipal property.  The Court expressly declines to "pass" on the question of the constitutionality of an outright municipal ban on newsracks.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#762">486 U. S. 762</a></span>, n. 7.  My approach to the specific question before us, which differs from that of the majority, requires me to consider this question; and, as discussed below, our precedents suggest that an outright ban on newsracks on city sidewalks would be constitutional, particularly where (as is true here) ample alternative means of 24-hour distribution of newspapers exist.  In any event, the Court\'s ruling today cannot be read as any indication to the contrary:  cities remain free after today\'s decision to enact such bans.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Court expressly rejects the view, heretofore adopted by some lower courts, that any local scheme that seeks to license the placement of newsracks on public property is <em>per se</em> unconstitutional. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Cities "may require periodic licensing, and may even have special licensing procedures for conduct commonly associated with expression."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#760">486 U. S. 760</a></span>.  It is only common sense that cities be allowed to exert some control over those who would permanently appropriate city property for the purpose of erecting a newspaper dispensing device.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with the Court is not over the constitutional status of newsracks or the more specific question of the propriety of the licensing of such newspaper vending devices.  The dispute in this case is over a more "technical" question:  what is the scope of the peculiar doctrine that governs facial challenges to local laws in the First Amendment area?  The majority reads our cases as holding that local licensing laws which have</p>\n<p>"a close enough nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 486 U. S. 774</a></p><p> pose a real and substantial threat of [an] identified censorship ris[k],"</p>\n<p>will be considered invalid</p>\n<p>"whenever [such a law] gives a government official . . . substantial power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#759">486 U. S. 759</a></span>.  This is true, the majority believes, whether or not the speaker can prove that the official\'s power has been or will be used against him; indeed, it is true even if the government official indicates a willingness to abjure the use of such power (as is the case here).</p>\n<p>It is true that certain licensing laws that "giv[e] a government official . . . substantial power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech" are unconstitutional on their face -- without any showing of actual censorship or discrimination, or even without the potential licensee even making an application for a license.  But the sweep of this potent doctrine must be limited in a way that is principled; one that is rooted in our precedents and our history.  The Court\'s statement that this doctrine applies whenever the license law has "a close . . . nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression," is unduly broad.  The doctrine, as I see it, applies only when the specific conduct which the locality seeks to license is protected by the First Amendment.  Because the placement of newsracks on city property is not so protected (as opposed to the circulation of newspapers as a general matter), the exception to our usual facial challenge doctrine does not apply here.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our prior cases, and an examination of the case before us, indicate that the Lakewood ordinance is not invalid because it vests "excessive discretion" in Lakewood\'s Mayor to grant or deny a newsrack permit.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court has historically been reluctant to entertain facial attacks on statutes, <em>i.e.,</em> claims that a statute is invalid in all of its applications.  Our normal approach has been to determine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 486 U. S. 775</a></p><p> whether a law is unconstitutional as applied in the particular case before the Court. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  This rule is also the usual approach we follow when reviewing laws that require licenses or permits to engage in business or other activities.  In <em>New York ex rel. Lieberman v. Van De Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/199/552/case.html">199 U. S. 552</a></span> (1905), for example, plaintiff in error was convicted of selling milk in New York City without a permit.  Plaintiff in error claimed before this Court that the licensing law vested arbitrary power in an administrative board to select those who would be permitted to sell milk.  This Court\'s response was:</p>\n<p>"[Prior] cases leave in no doubt the proposition that the conferring of discretionary power upon administrative boards to grant or withhold permission to carry on a trade or business which is the proper subject of regulation within the police power of the state is not violative of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.  There is no presumption that the power will be arbitrarily exercised, and, when it is shown to be thus exercised against the individual, under sanction of state authority this court has not hesitated to interfere for his protection, when the case has come before it in such manner as to authorize the interference of a Federal court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/199/552/case.html#562">199 U. S. 562</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There being no showing that the law had been unconstitutionally applied to plaintiff in error, his conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p>"One who is required to take out a license will not be heard to complain, in advance of application, that there is a danger of refusal.  He should apply and see what happens. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 486 U. S. 776</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/608/case.html">300 U. S. 608</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/608/case.html#616">300 U. S. 616</a></span>-617 (1937) (citations omitted).  Other cases are to the same effect. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Thus, the usual rule is that a law requiring permits for specified activities is not unconstitutional because it vests discretion in administrative officials to grant or deny the permit.  The Constitution does not require the Court to assume that such discretion will be illegally exercised.  <em>Douglas v. Noble,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/165/case.html">261 U. S. 165</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/165/case.html#170">261 U.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>There are, however, a few well established contexts in which the Court has departed from its insistence on an as-applied approach to constitutional adjudication.  One of them is where a permit or license is required to engage in expressive activities protected by the First Amendment, and official discretion to grant or deny is not suitably confined.</p>\n<p>"In the area of freedom of expression, it is well established that one has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it delegates overly broad licensing discretion to an administrative office, whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly drawn statute, and whether or not he applied for a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 486 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It is this line of cases on which the majority draws to support its conclusion that the Lakewood ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#755">486 U.

In each of the cases, the expressive conduct which a city sought to license was an activity which the locality could not prohibit altogether.  Streets, sidewalks, and parks are traditional public fora; leafletting, pamphletting, and speaking in such places may be regulated, <em>Cox v.

Such license requirements are struck down only when they affect the "enjoyment of freedoms which the Constitution guarantees."  <em>See Staub v.

S. 778</a></p><p> for all stores which sold newspapers.  These are obviously newspaper circulation activities which a municipality cannot prohibit and, therefore, any licensing scheme of this scope would have to pass muster under the <em>Lovell-Freedman</em> doctrine.  But -- and this is critical -- Lakewood has not cast so wide a net.  Instead, it has sought to license only the placement of newsracks (and other like devices) on city property.  As I read our precedents, the <em>Lovell-Freedman</em> line of cases is applicable here only if the Plain Dealer has a constitutional right to distribute its papers by means of dispensing devices or newsboxes, affixed to the public sidewalks.  I am not convinced that this is the case.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellee has a right to distribute its newspapers on the city\'s streets, as others have a right to leaflet, solicit, speak, or proselytize in this same public forum area.  But this "does not mean that [appellee] can . . . distribute [its newspapers] where, when and how [it] chooses."  <em>See Breard v.

More specifically, the Plain Dealer\'s right to distribute its papers does not encompass the right to take city property -- a part of the public forum, as appellee so vigorously argues -- and appropriate it for its own exclusive use, on a semipermanent basis, by means of the erection of a newsbox. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  "The publisher of a newspaper . . . </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 486 U.

There is a First Amendment right to sell books, but we would not accept an argument that a city must allow a bookseller to construct a bookshop -- even a small one -- on a city sidewalk.  The right to leaflet does not create a right to build a booth on city streets from which leafletting can be conducted.  Preventing the "taking" of public property for these purposes does not abridge First Amendment freedoms.  Just as there is no First Amendment right to operate a bookstore or locate a movie theater however or wherever one chooses, notwithstanding local laws to the contrary, <em>see Arcara v.

But those seeking to distribute materials protected by the First Amendment do not have a right to appropriate public property merely because it best facilitates their efforts.

Because the Lakewood ordinance does not directly regulate an activity protected by the First Amendment, we should instead take the traditional, as-applied approach to adjudication exemplified by the <em>Lieberman</em> line of cases.  Appellee\'s facial challenge to the Mayor\'s discretion under \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(7) should therefore be rejected.</p>\n<p>The Court offers three reasons for departing from this time-tested approach for applying the <em>Lovell-Freedman</em> doctrine, and for substituting its new "nexus to expression" test.  I consider these three reasons in turn.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>First, the majority seeks support for its rejection of the foregoing analysis by comparing two previous decisions:  <em>Saia v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html">334 U. S. 558</a></span> (1948), and <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, supra.</em> <em>Saia</em> struck down a local ordinance vesting absolute discretion in a local official over permits for the use of sound amplification trucks; <em>Kovacs</em> upheld a local law which totally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 486 U. S. 785</a></p><p> banned the use of such trucks.  Today\'s majority states that in <em>Kovacs, Saia</em> was distinguished on grounds that support its position here.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#764">486 U. S. 764</a></span>-766.</p>\n<p>The majority\'s reading of these two cases is flawed for several reasons.  First, the "rationale of <em>Kovacs</em>" on which the majority relies was not the Court\'s view at all, but rather, an opinion for a three-Justice plurality.  <em>See Kovacs, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#78">336 U. S. 78</a></span>-89 (opinion of Reed, J.).  In fact, four other Justices in <em>Kovacs</em> understood the Court\'s action in that case in the exact contrary manner -- <em>i.e.,</em> as being a repudiation of the earlier decision in <em>Saia.</em> <em>See Kovacs, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#97">336 U. S. 97</a></span>-98 (Jackson, J., concurring); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#101">336 U. S. 101</a></span>-102 (Black, Douglas, and Rutledge, JJ., dissenting).  Thus, the majority\'s explanation of how a comparison of <em>Kovacs</em> and <em>Saia</em> support its conclusion rests on a view of those two cases that was rejected by more Justices than accepted it at the time that <em>Kovacs</em> was decided.</p>\n<p>An equally plausible reading of <em>Saia</em> is the one that a plurality of Justices took when revisiting the sound-truck question in <em>Kovacs:  Saia</em> rested on the "assumption" -- later proved erroneous in <em>Kovacs</em> -- that a municipality could not ban sound trucks altogether.  <em>Saia</em> repeatedly suggests that a "ban" on sound trucks would not pass constitutional muster.  <em>See</em> 334 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html#562">334 U. S. 562</a></span>.  <em>Cf. also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html#559">334 U.

And the Court in <em>Saia</em> indicated that it was moved by its view that sound-trucks were "indispensable instruments of effective public speech."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html#561">334 U. S. 561</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Since <em>Saia\'s</em> underlying premise was called into question in <em>Kovacs,</em> 336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#97">336 U. S. 97</a></span>-98 (Jackson, J., concurring); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html#101">336 U. S. 101</a></span>-102 (Black, J., dissenting), at the very least, the majority\'s <em>Saia-Kovacs</em> comparison is a shaky foundation for the departure from prior precedent which the Court now undertakes.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>Second, the Court incorrectly suggests that I rely on the now-discredited "greater-includes-the-lesser" formulation of Justice Holmes, as adopted by this Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/167/43/case.html">Davis v. Massachusetts,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 486 U. S. 786</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/167/43/case.html">167 U.

The majority then engages in a detailed analysis of cases having no applicability here whatsoever, <em>ante</em> at 766-767, to slay this strawman of its own creation.</p>\n<p>As defined at its inception, "greater-includes-the-lesser" reasoning holds that, where a State or municipality may ban an activity altogether, it is consequently free "to determine under what circumstances such [activity] may be availed of, as the greater power contains the lesser."  <em>See Davis, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/167/48/case.html">167 U. S. 48</a></span>.  But if, for example, a Lakewood ordinance provided for the issuance of newsrack licenses to only those newspapers owned by persons of a particular race, or only to members of a select political party, such a law would be clearly violative of the First Amendment (or some other provision of the Constitution), and would be facially invalid.  And if the Mayor of Lakewood granted or refused license applications for similar improper reasons, his exercise of the power provided him under \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(7) would be susceptible to constitutional attack.  Thus, I do not embrace the "greater-includes-the-lesser" syllogism -- one that this Court abandoned long ago.  <em>Cf. Hague v.

S. 515</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Instead, my view is simply this:  where an activity that could be forbidden altogether (without running afoul of the First Amendment) is subjected to a local license requirement, the mere presence of administrative discretion in the licensing scheme will not render it invalid <em>per se.</em>  In such a case -- which does not involve the exercise of First Amendment protected freedoms -- the <em>Lovell-Freedman</em> doctrine does not apply, and our usual rules concerning the permissibility of discretionary local licensing laws (and facial challenges to those laws) must prevail.</p>\n<p><em>(3)\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, the Court asserts that I do not understand the nature of the conduct at issue here.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#768">486 U. S. 768</a></span>.  It is asserted that "[t]he actual <em>activity\' at issue here is the circulation </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 486 U. S. 787</a></em></p><p><em> of newspapers, which is constitutionally protected."  <em>Ibid.</em>  But of course, this is wrong.  Lakewood does not, by its ordinance, seek to license the circulation of newspapers within the city.  In fact, the Lakewood ordinance does not even require licenses of all newsracks within the jurisdiction -- the many newsracks located within Lakewood on private property are not included within the scope of the city\'s ordinance.  <em>See</em> App. 373-374.  Thus, it is the majority -- and not I -- that is guilty of "recharacterizing" the activity that Lakewood licenses.  The Lakewood ordinance must be considered for what it is:  a license requirement for newsracks on city property.\n</em></p>\n<p>This is why, notwithstanding the Court\'s intimations to the contrary, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#766">486 U. S. 766</a></span>-769, my approach would not change the outcome of our previous cases in this area.  In those cases, the local law at issue required licenses -- not for a narrow category of expressive conduct that could be prohibited -- but for a sweeping range of First Amendment protected activity.  Thus, the law at issue in <em>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html#149">394 U. S. 149</a></span>, required a license for "any parade"; the license scheme under attack in <em>Freedman v. Maryland,</em> 380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#52">380 U. S. 52</a></span>-53, and n. 1, applied to all films shown in the State of Maryland; the law at issue in <em>Lovell v. Griffin,</em> 303 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/case.html#451">303 U. S. 451</a></span>, applied to any distribution of leaflets or pamphlets within the city limits.  Surely, even at the extreme level of abstraction at which the Court operates in its opinion, the majority can recognize a difference between the scope and dangers of these laws and Lakewood\'s more focused regulation.  <em>See also</em> <l=|486 13|="" 750fn2="" u.s.="">n. 13, <em>infra.</em></l=|486></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>I now address the rule of decision the majority offers.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Instead of the relatively clear rule that the Court\'s prior cases support, the majority today adopts a more amorphous measure of when the <em>Lovell-Freedman</em> doctrine should apply. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 486 U.

A great variety of discretionary power may be abused to limit freedom of expression, yet that does not mean that such delegations of power are facially invalid.  <em>See Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/case.html">455 U.

[<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The new Lakewood ordinance enacted in tandem with \xc2\xa7 901.181 illustrates this principle well.  As discussed <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#753">486 U. S. 753</a></span>-754, when the District Court invalidated Lakewood\'s complete ban on all structures on city property (then \xc2\xa7 901.18 of the city code), the city enacted two new ordinances.  One, \xc2\xa7 901.181, provides for licensing newsracks on city property -- the subject of this appeal.  The second, \xc2\xa7 901.18, gives the City Council <em>unlimited</em> discretion to grant or deny applications for all other exclusive uses of city property.   App. 266-267.  Someone who wishes to apply for permission under \xc2\xa7 901.18 to erect a soft drink vending machine on city property may fear that his application will be denied because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 486 U. S. 789</a></p><p> he has engaged in some First Amendment protected activities which are not to the City Council\'s liking.  These fears may even be substantial, and they may be based on facts eminently provable in a courtroom; <em>e.g.,</em> that the applicant opposed a City Councilwoman in her last election campaign.  Yet surely \xc2\xa7 901.18 is not invalid on its face merely because it creates the possibility that the discretion accorded therein to the City Council could be abused in the way that the soft-drink vending machine applicant fears.  <em>Cf. Grayned v. City of Rockford,</em> 408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/case.html#121">408 U. S. 121</a></span>, n. 50; <em>Euclid v.

S. 395</a></span>-396 (1926).</p>\n<p>Seeking a way to limit its own expansive ruling, the Court provides two concrete examples of instances in which its newly crafted "nexus to expression" rule will not strike down local ordinances that permit discretionary licensing decisions.  First, we are told that a law granting unbridled discretion to a mayor to grant licenses for soda machine placements passes constitutional muster because it does not give that official "frequent opportunities to exercise substantial power over the content or viewpoint of the vendor\'s speech."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#761">486 U. S. 761</a></span>.  How the Court makes this empirical assessment, I do not know.  It seems to me that the nature of a vendor\'s product -- be it newspapers or soda pop -- is not the measure of how potent a license law can be in the hands of local officials seeking to control or alter the vendor\'s speech.  Of course, the newspaper vendor\'s speech is likely to be more public, more significant, and more widely known than the soda vendor\'s speech -- and therefore more likely to incur the wrath of public officials.  But in terms of the "usefulness" of the license power to exert control over a licensee\'s speech, there is no difference whatsoever between the situation of the soda vendor and the newspaper vendor. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 486 U. S. 790</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If the Court\'s treatment of the soda machine problem is not curious enough, it also "assures" us that its ruling does not invalidate local laws requiring, for example, building permits -- even as they apply to the construction of newspaper printing facilities.  These laws, we are told, provide "too blunt a censorship instrument to warrant judicial intervention."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#761">486 U. S. 761</a></span>.  Thus, local "laws of general application that are not aimed at conduct commonly associated with expression" appear to survive the Court\'s decision today.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#760">486 U. S. 760</a></span>-761.</p>\n<p>But what if Lakewood, following this decision, repeals local ordinance \xc2\xa7 901.181 (the detailed newsrack permit law) and simply left \xc2\xa7 901.18 (the general ordinance concerning "any . . . structure or device" on city property) on the books?  That section vests absolute discretion (without any of the guidelines found in \xc2\xa7 901.181) in the City Council to give or withhold permission for the erection of devices on city streets.  Because this law is of "general application," it should survive scrutiny under the Court\'s opinion -- even as applied to newsracks.  If so, the Court\'s opinion takes on an odd "the-greater-but-not-the-lesser" quality:  the more activities that are subjected to a discretionary licensing law, the more likely that law is to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>As noted above, our tradition has been to discourage facial challenges, and rather, to entertain constitutional attacks on local laws only as they are applied to the litigants.  The facts of this case indicate why that policy is a prudent one.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, there could be no allegation in this case that the Mayor\'s discretion to deny permits <em>actually</em> has been abused to the detriment of the newspaper, for the Plain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="791">Page 486 U. S. 791</a></p><p> Dealer has not applied for a permit for its newsracks under \xc2\xa7 901.181.  App. to Juris. Statement A30.  Indeed, the District Court found that the "Mayor stands ready and willing to permit coin-operated newspaper dispensing devices in the commercial areas of the City" pursuant to the ordinance.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It also found that the</p>\n<p>"only reason why the [appellee] has not placed newspaper dispensing devices along the streets of Lakewood, where permitted, is that the [appellee] has not applied for such use."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at A32.</p>\n<p>Indicative of the true nature of this litigation is the fact that the city of Lakewood has had on the books, since January 1987, an interim ordinance that licenses the placement of newsracks on city property -- an ordinance that is free of the constitutional defects challenged here.  Eighteen months have passed since the interim ordinance was enacted, and the Plain Dealer apparently still has not applied for a license to place its newsracks on city property. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Thus, the Court, with a strange rhetorical flourish, belittles the usefulness of judicial review as a tool to control the Mayor\'s discretion in granting newsrack licenses because newspaper publishers and their reading public cannot afford to await the results of the judicial process.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#771">486 U. S. 771</a></span>.  "[N]ewspaper publishers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 486 U. S. 792</a></p><p> can[not] wait indefinitely for a permit" and "a paper needs public access at a particular time," we are remonstrated.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#771">486 U. S. 771</a></span>-772.  Yet the Plain Dealer has eschewed the availability of a wholly constitutional permit for its newsracks for a year and a half.</p>\n<p>The Court mentions the risk of censorship, the ever-present danger of self-censorship, and the power of prior restraint to justify the result.  <em>See, e.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#757">486 U. S. 757</a></span>-759,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#767">486 U. S. 767</a></span>-768.  Yet these fears and concerns have little to do with this case, which involves the efforts of Ohio\'s largest newspaper to place a handful of newsboxes in a few locations in a small suburban community.  Even if one accepts the testimony of appellee\'s own expert, it seems unlikely that the newsboxes at issue here would increase the Plain Dealer\'s circulation within Lakewood by more than a percent or two; the paper\'s overall circulation would be affected only by about one one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%).  <em>See</em> App. 82-84, 214.</p>\n<p>It is hard to see how the Court\'s concerns have any applicability here.  And it is harder still to see how the Court\'s image of the unbridled local censor, seeking to control and direct the content of speech, fits this case.  In the case before us, the city of Lakewood declined to appeal an adverse ruling against its ban on newsracks, and instead amended its local laws to permit appellee to place its newsboxes on city property.  <em>See id.</em> at 270-274.  When the nature of this ordinance was not to the Plain Dealer\'s liking, Lakewood again amended its local laws to meet the newspaper\'s concerns.  <em>See id.</em> at 275.  Finally, when the newspaper, still disgruntled, won a judgment against Lakewood from the Court of Appeals, the city once again amended its ordinance to address the constitutional issues.  <em>See</em> App. to Brief for Appellee A56-A59.  The Court\'s David and Goliath imagery concerning the balance of power between the regulated and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 486 U. S. 793</a></p><p> the regulator in this case is wholly inapt -- except, possibly, in reverse. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because, unlike the Court, I find that the Lakewood ordinance is not invalid by virtue of the discretion it vests in the city\'s Mayor, I must reach the question of whether the law is invalid for the other reasons the Court of Appeals cited.  I conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>A similar analysis to the one I suggest in Parts II and III, <em>supra,</em> applies to Lakewood ordinance \xc2\xa7 901.181(a), concerning the Architectural Review Board.  Appellee argues </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 486 U. S. 794</a></p><p> that this ordinance provision, like the one giving discretion to the Mayor to grant or deny permit applications, vests excessive and unbridled discretion in the Board, and thereby is violative of the First Amendment.  But for the reasons that I concluded, <em>supra,</em> at 784, that \xc2\xa7 901.181 does not directly regulate activity protected by the First Amendment, I think this facial challenge to the Architectural Review Board\'s role under the ordinance must fail as the challenge to \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(7) did.  Section 901.181(a) does not fall simply because the Board <em>may</em> find a way to use its discretion to suppress speech.</p>\n<p>The fallacy of the Plain Dealer\'s argument to the contrary is exposed by considering its full implications.  Under Lakewood Codified Ordinance \xc2\xa7 1325.04, the Architectural Review Board has discretion to approve or reject designs for "<em>all</em> new construction . . . within the City."  <em>See</em> App. 386 (emphasis added).  If we were to accept the Plain Dealer\'s analysis that any potentially speech-suppressing discretion renders a local law facially invalid, we would have to strike \xc2\xa7 1325 as well:  after all, the Board could use its discretion under that ordinance to punish or chill the speech of any person in the city seeking to construct a new building. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Yet this mere possibility is not sufficient to invalidate \xc2\xa7 1325.  Likewise, the potential for abuse under \xc2\xa7 901.181(a) -- which simply subjects newsracks to the same architectural review applied to all other structures erected in Lakewood -- is not sufficient to invalidate that provision either.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment does not grant immunity to the Plain Dealer from the city\'s general laws regulating businesses that operate therein.  "The publisher of a newspaper </p><p><a class="page-number" name="795">Page 486 U. S. 795</a></p><p> has no special immunity from the application of general laws."  <em>Associated Press v. NLRB,</em> 301 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/103/case.html#132">301 U. S. 132</a></span>; <em>see also, e.g., Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/131/case.html">394 U. S. 131</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/131/case.html#139">394 U. S. 139</a></span> (1969); <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v.

The District Court found that Lakewood has applied its architectural review process to all new construction in the city.   App. to Juris. Statement A36.  According to the city, bookstores, theaters, and churches under construction or renovation have all been required to obtain board approval for their construction.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant 37-38.  To hold that all structure where First Amendment protected activities take place are somehow exempt from this normal local regulation would be anomalous and contrary to our precedents.  <em>See Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/50/case.html#62">427 U. S. 62</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, 794 F.2d 1139, 1146 (CA6 1986), thought it significant that the Board had no specific standards applying to newsrack designs, but rather, had only general architectural standards applicable to "buildings."  Of course, this basis for disapproval is particularly ironic, since the "narro[w] and specifi[c]" focus of \xc2\xa7 901.181 on the placement of newsracks is one reason why this Court finds that law to be suspect.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#760">486 U. S. 760</a></span>.  Consequently, with respect to a future ordinance free from the defect the Court finds fault with today, the city of Lakewood finds itself between a rock and a hard place:  make the rules newsrack-specific, and be accused of drawing the noose too tightly around First Amendment protected activities; apply more general rules to newsracks, and be told that your regulators lack standards sufficiently specific to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p>The conundrum is unfortunate.  Simply because a newspaper may find new ways to distribute its papers, via semipermanent structures that are not "buildings," should not permit the publisher to escape otherwise all-inclusive city regulation.  Section 901.181(a) simply takes the rule that applies generally to all new structures in Lakewood and extends it to cover the structures at issue here:  newsracks. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="796">Page 486 U. S. 796</a></p><p>  Newsracks have no First Amendment right to be placed on city streets with disregard for these important economic and esthetic concerns, or to contribute to the "visual blight" cities are working so hard to eradicate.  <em>See Vincent,</em> 466 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html#810">466 U. S. 810</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court\'s opinion provides substantial support for the view that Lakewood\'s Architectural Review Board requirement is constitutional.  As I noted, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#790">486 U. S. 790</a></span>, the Court today holds that laws of general application are not invalid due to excessive discretion, even when they are applied to expressive activities.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#760">486 U. S. 760</a></span>-761.  Since the architectural review requirement is such a law of general application, it appears to me that the Court\'s opinion implicitly sustains the constitutionality of the imposition of this requirement on appellee\'s newsboxes.  Moreover, since this portion of the Lakewood ordinance only requires the approval of the Architectural Review Board on a single occasion, at the time of the initial adoption of a particular newsbox design, I think it is clearly encompassed within the Court\'s discussion of permissible building permit laws.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The final disputed provision of the Lakewood ordinance, \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(5), requires that newsrack owners indemnify the city for "any and all liability . . . occasioned upon the installation and use" of any newsrack.  It also requires newsrack permittees to obtain liability insurance in the amount of $100,000 to cover any such liability.</p>\n<p>The city\'s reasons for imposing such requirements are obvious.  Under Ohio law, a municipality has no sovereign immunity, and "is liable for its negligence in the performance or nonperformance of its acts."  <em>Haverlack v. Portage Homes, Inc.,</em> 2 Ohio St.3d 26, 30, 442 N.E.2d 749, 752 (1982); <em>cf. Dickerhoof v. Canton,</em> 6 Ohio St.3d 128, 451 N.E.2d 1193 (1983).  While there is some dispute between the parties as to how substantial is the city\'s risk of being held liable for an injury caused by a newsbox located on city property, there </p><p><a class="page-number" name="797">Page 486 U. S. 797</a></p><p> remains sufficient risk to suggest that avoiding such liability is a legitimate concern of Lakewood\'s City Council.</p>\n<p>In fact, appellee acknowledges that, standing alone, the city\'s indemnification and insurance requirements would be constitutional; the Plain Dealer recognizes that there is no constitutional bar to requiring newspaper distributors to meet such requirements. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  Nor does it argue that such insurance policies are unobtainable, or make the use of newsboxes economically infeasible. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Rather, appellee argues (and the Court of Appeals found), that this provision is invalid because it applies to newsracks and not other "users" of the public streets.  794 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="798">Page 486 U. S. 798</a></p><p> F.2d at 1147.</p>\n<p>This Court has consistently held that "differential treatment . . . [for] the press . . . is presumptively unconstitutional."  <em>See Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm\'r of Revenue,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/575/case.html">460 U. S. 575</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/575/case.html#585">460 U. S. 585</a></span> (1983).  Yet, in this case, I find this argument inapposite and unpersuasive.  First, it ignores the obvious difference between those on-street objects that are essential to the public safety and welfare -- such as bus shelters, telephone and electric wiring poles, and emergency phone boxes -- and the preferred distribution means of a private newspaper company, the Plain Dealer\'s newsboxes.  Judge Unthank, in concurrence below, recognized the difference between these "public services of a quasi-governmental nature," and appellee\'s newsracks.  794 F.2d at 1148.  I also find the difference to be a significant one. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>Until this litigation ensued, a Lakewood ordinance banned the construction of any new structure on city property.  The new ordinances, adopted in response to the initial District Court decision below, which allow such structures, do explicitly require insurance from newsrack-permittee holders, while being silent on this question with respect to other potential permittees on public land.  <em>Compare</em> \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(5) <em>with</em> \xc2\xa7 901.18.  But there is nothing in the record to suggest that the city would not require such insurance of any applicant under \xc2\xa7 901.18.  <em>Cf. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority,</em> 745 F.2d 767, 773-774 (CA2 1984); <em>see also ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/750/case.html#755">486 U. S. 755</a></span>, n. 3.  If the city does begin to treat nonpress permittees more favorably than newsrack permittees, the Plain Dealer may have a valid constitutional challenge to \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(5) at that time.  But I am unwilling to imply that such will be the city\'s practice based on the record before us.  <em>See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/41/case.html#53">475 U. S. 53</a></span>.

The plenary power given state public utility commissions to regulate local utilities too can be misused to infringe on protected speech rights, <em>see Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

These factors also distinguish the Lakewood ordinance from the local licensing laws under consideration in the cases that the Court relies on it its opinion.</p>\n<p>First, unlike many regulatory schemes we have struck down in the past, <em>cf., e.g., Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html#149">394 U. S. 149</a></span>-150,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html#153">394 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/147/case.html#157">394 U. S. 157</a></span>-158, \xc2\xa7 901.181 requires that the Mayor state the reasons for any denial of a newsrack permit application.  This statement of reasons should facilitate review of the Mayor\'s decision, and help to insure that it does not rest on an unconstitutional rationale.</p>\n<p>Second, the availability of such review of mayoral decisions is another distinguishing aspect of the ordinance.  <em>Cf., e.g., Staub v. Baxley,</em> 355 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/313/case.html#325">355 U. S. 325</a></span>.  Section 901.181(e), allows (in the first instance) appeal to the City Council of any unfavorable mayoral decision.  Then, if this appeal is unsuccessful, a dissatisfied applicant can seek relief from the Ohio courts under state law.  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2506.01 <em>et seq.</em> (Supp.1987).  These appeals provide assurance that any abuse of the Mayor\'s discretion under the Ordinance is unlikely to go unremedied.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court ignores the fact that the license that appellee seeks is not for conducting an activity (such as showing films or organizing a parade) for which a "most propitious opportunity for exhibition [may] pas[s]," <em>Freedman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#61">380 U. S. 61</a></span>, but rather for the erection of a semipermanent structure on city property.  Thus, the administrative and judicial appeals processes made available by city and state laws can serve as a more effective check on the Mayor\'s decisionmaking, with less of a burden on the permit-applicant, than was the case in <em>Freedman</em> or <em>Shuttlesworth.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/14" name="F2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>Not only would Lakewood\'s ordinance fall to such a challenge, but so too would countless other local laws that grant Architectural Review Boards substantial discretion to approve the construction plans of applicants who may fear reprisal for the exercise of their First Amendment rights, or who wish to construct some structure in which First Amendment protected activities will take place.  <em>See</em> App. B to Brief for National Institute of Municipal Law Officers as <em>Amicus Curiae.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>The following excerpt from oral argument makes this point clear:</p>\n<p>"QUESTION:  [Y]ou assert that it is not possible under the First Amendment for the city to require indemnity insurance for those devices?  I think that is a remarkable proposition."</p>\n<p>"MR. GARNER [Appellee\'s Counsel]:  No, I am not suggesting that, Your Honor.  No.  No, I am not suggesting that. . . ."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/16" name="F2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor could the Plain Dealer so argue.  Lakewood introduced as exhibits at trial copies of $1 million liability insurance policies (10 times the amount required by ordinance \xc2\xa7 901.181(c)(5)) that the Plain Dealer obtained for the benefit of 11 other cities in Ohio -- including the city of Cleveland -- where it has located newsracks on public property.  App. 401.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, it may be beyond Lakewood\'s control to impose indemnity and insurance requirements on those entities that have structures on public property that predate the city\'s recent legislation.  According to appellant, many of these placements of utility poles, signal boxes, and the like are on property obtained by utilities from the city via easement grants several decades old.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.</p>\n<p>The city contended at argument (without dispute from the Plain Dealer) that it is Lakewood\'s policy to place indemnification and insurance requirements in all city rental contracts at this time.  <em>See ibid.</em>  Henceforth, then, the preexisting nonindemnifying structures on city property will become the "isolated exceptions, and not the rule."  <em>See Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v.
