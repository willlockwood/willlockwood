The mortgage was recorded in the Elkhart County Recorder\'s Office on March 1, 1973.  Under the terms of the agreement, Moore was responsible for paying all of the property taxes.  Without MBM\'s knowledge, however, she failed to pay taxes on the property.</p>\n<p>Indiana law provides for the annual sale of real property on which payments of property taxes have been delinquent for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 462 U. S. 793</a></p><p> 15 months or longer.  Ind.Code \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-1 <em>et seq.</em> (1982).  Prior to the sale, the county auditor must post notice in the county courthouse and publish notice once each week for three consecutive weeks.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-3.  The owner of the property is entitled to notice by certified mail to his last known address.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-4. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Until 1980, however, Indiana law did not provide for notice by mail or personal service to mortgagees of property that was to be sold for nonpayment of taxes. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>After the required notice is provided, the county treasurer holds a public auction at which the real property is sold to the highest bidder.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-5.  The purchaser acquires a certificate of sale which constitutes a lien against the real property for the entire amount paid.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-9.  This lien is superior to all other liens against the property which existed at the time the certificate was issued.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The tax sale is followed by a 2-year redemption period during which the "owner, occupant, lienholder, or other person who has an interest in" the property may redeem the property.   6-1.125-1.  To redeem the property, an individual must pay the county treasurer a sum sufficient to cover the purchase price of the property at the tax sale and the amount of taxes and special assessments paid by the purchaser following the sale, plus an additional percentage specified in the statute.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-2.  The county, in turn, remits the payment to the purchaser of the property at the tax sale.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-3. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 462 U. S. 794</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If no one redeems the property during the statutory redemption period, the purchaser may apply to the county auditor for a deed to the property.  Before executing and delivering the deed, the county auditor must notify the former owner that he is still entitled to redeem the property.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-6.  No notice to the mortgagee is required.  If the property is not redeemed within 30 days, the county auditor may then execute and deliver a deed for the property to the purchaser, \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-4, who thereby acquires "an estate in fee simple absolute, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances."  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-4(d).</p>\n<p>After obtaining a deed, the purchaser may initiate an action to quiet his title to the property.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-14.  The previous owner, lienholders, and others who claim to have an interest in the property may no longer redeem the property.  They may defeat the title conveyed by the tax deed only by proving, <em>inter alia,</em> that the property had not been subject to, or assessed for, the taxes for which it was sold, that the taxes had been paid before the sale, or that the property was properly redeemed before the deed was executed.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-25-16.</p>\n<p>In 1977, Elkhart County initiated proceedings to sell Moore\'s property for nonpayment of taxes.  The county provided notice as required under the statute:  it posted and published an announcement of the tax sale and mailed notice to Moore by certified mail.  MBM was not informed of the pending tax sale either by the County Auditor or by Moore.  The property was sold for $1,167.75 to appellee Richard Adams on August 8, 1977.  Neither Moore nor MBM appeared at the sale or took steps thereafter to redeem the property.  Following the sale of her property, Moore continued to make payments each month to MBM, and as a result MBM did not realize that the property had been sold.  On August 16, 1979, MBM first learned of the tax sale.  By then the redemption period had run and Moore still owed appellant $8,237.19. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="795">Page 462 U. S. 795</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In November, 1979, Adams filed a suit in state court seeking to quiet title to the property.  In opposition to Adams\' motion for summary judgment, MBM contended that it had not received constitutionally adequate notice of the pending tax sale and of the opportunity to redeem the property following the tax sale.  The trial court upheld the Indiana tax sale statute against this constitutional challenge.  The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed.  427 N.E.2d 686 (1981).  We noted probable jurisdiction, 459 U.S. 903 (1982), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Mullane v.

City of Hutchinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/112/case.html">352 U. S. 112</a></span> (1956), for example, the Court held that notice of condemnation proceedings published in a local newspaper was an inadequate means of informing a landowner whose name was known to the city and was on the official records.  Similarly, in <em>Schroeder v. New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/208/case.html">371 U. S. 208</a></span> (1962), the Court concluded that publication in a newspaper and posted notices were inadequate to apprise a property owner of condemnation proceedings when his name and address were readily ascertainable from both deed records and tax rolls.

S. 798</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case is controlled by the analysis in <em>Mullane.</em>  To begin with, a mortgagee possesses a substantial property interest that is significantly affected by a tax sale.  Under Indiana law, a mortgagee acquires a lien on the owner\'s property which may be conveyed together with the mortgagor\'s personal obligation to repay the debt secured by the mortgage.  Ind.Code \xc2\xa7 32-8-11-7 (1982).  A mortgagee\'s security interest generally has priority over subsequent claims or liens attaching to the property, and a purchase money mortgage takes precedence over virtually all other claims or liens, including those which antedate the execution of the mortgage.  \xc2\xa7 32-8-11-4.  The tax sale immediately and drastically diminishes the value of this security interest by granting the tax sale purchaser a lien with priority over that of all other creditors.  Ultimately, the tax sale may result in the complete nullification of the mortgagee\'s interest, since the purchaser acquires title free of all liens and other encumbrances at the conclusion of the redemption period.</p>\n<p>Since a mortgagee clearly has a legally protected property interest, he is entitled to notice reasonably calculated to apprise him of a pending tax sale.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/55/52/case.html">55 U. S. </a></span> Sampson,</em> 14 How. 52,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/55/52/case.html#67">55 U. S. 67</a></span> (1853).  When the mortgagee is identified in a mortgage that is publicly recorded, constructive notice by publication must be supplemented by notice mailed to the mortgagee\'s last known available address, or by personal service.  But unless the mortgagee is not reasonably identifiable, constructive notice alone does not satisfy the mandate of <em>Mullane.</em> [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="799">Page 462 U. S. 799</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Neither notice by publication and posting, nor mailed notice to the property owner, are means "such as one desirous of actually informing the [mortgagee] might reasonably adopt to accomplish it."  <em>Mullane,</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#315">339 U. S. 315</a></span>.  Because they are designed primarily to attract prospective purchasers to the tax sale, publication and posting are unlikely to reach those who, although they have an interest in the property, do not make special efforts to keep abreast of such notices.  <em>Walker v. City of Hutchinson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/112/case.html#116">352 U. S. 116</a></span>; <em>New York City v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/293/case.html#296">344 U. S. 296</a></span>; <em>Mullane, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#315">339 U. S. 315</a></span>.  Notice to the property owner, who is not in privity with his creditor and who has failed to take steps necessary to preserve his own property interest, also cannot be expected to lead to actual notice to the mortgagee.  <em>Cf. Nelson v. New York City,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/103/case.html">352 U. S. 103</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/352/103/case.html#107">352 U. S. 107</a></span>-109 (1956).  The county\'s use of these less reliable forms of notice is not reasonable where, as here, "an inexpensive and efficient mechanism such as mail service is available."  <em>Greene v. Lindsey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/444/case.html#455">456 U. S. 455</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Personal service or mailed notice is required even though sophisticated creditors have means at their disposal to discover whether property taxes have not been paid and whether tax sale proceedings are therefore likely to be initiated.  In the first place, a mortgage need not involve a complex commercial transaction among knowledgeable parties, and it may well be the least sophisticated creditor whose security interest is threatened by a tax sale.  More importantly, a party\'s ability to take steps to safeguard its interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation.  It is true that particularly extensive efforts to provide notice may often be required when the State is aware of a party\'s inexperience or incompetence.  <em>See, e.g., Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#13">436 U. S. 13</a></span>-15; <em>Covey v. Town of Somers, supra.</em>  But it does not follow that the State may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="800">Page 462 U. S. 800</a></p><p> forgo even the relatively modest administrative burden of providing notice by mail to parties who are particularly resourceful. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Cf. New York City v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co.,</em> 344 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/293/case.html#297">344 U. S. 297</a></span>.  Notice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice is a minimum constitutional precondition to a proceeding which will adversely affect the liberty or property interests of any party, whether unlettered or well versed in commercial practice, if its name and address are reasonably ascertainable.  Furthermore, a mortgagee\'s knowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent to notice that a tax sale is pending.  The latter</p>\n<p>"was the information which the [county] was constitutionally obliged . . . to give personally to the appellant -- an obligation which the mailing of a single letter would have discharged."</p>\n<p><em>Schroeder v.

Constructive notice was never deemed sufficient to bind an individual in an action <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, in <em>in rem</em> or <em>quasi in rem</em> proceedings in which jurisdiction was based on the court\'s power over property within its territory, <em>see generally Shaffer v.

In order to settle questions of title to property within its territory, a state court was generally required to proceed by an <em>in rem</em> action, since the court could not otherwise bind nonresidents.  At one time, constructive service was considered the only means of notifying nonresidents, since it was believed that "[p]rocess from the tribunals of one State cannot run into another State."  <em>Pennoyer v.

If he "fail[ed] to get notice by the ordinary publications which have been usually required in such cases, it [was] his misfortune."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Rarely was a corresponding duty imposed on interested parties who resided within the State and whose identities were reasonably ascertainable.  Even in actions <em>in rem,</em> such individuals were generally provided personal service.  <em>See, e.g., Arndt v.

Where the identity of interested residents could not be ascertained after a reasonably diligent inquiry, however, their interests in property could be affected by a proceeding <em>in rem</em> as long as constructive notice was provided.  <em>See Hamilton v. Brown, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/275/case.html">161 U. S. 275</a></span>; <em>American Land Co v.

Heitner, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/186/case.html#206">433 U. S. 206</a></span>.  In rejecting the traditional justification for distinguishing between residents and nonresidents and between <em>in rem</em> and <em>in personam</em> actions, the Court has not left all interested claimants to the vagaries of indirect notice.  Our cases have required the State to make efforts to provide actual notice to all interested parties comparable to the efforts that were previously required only in <em>in personam.</em> actions.  <em>See infra,</em> this page.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, the mortgage on file with the County Recorder identified the mortgagee only as "MENNONITE BOARD OF MISSIONS, a corporation, of Wayne County, in the State of Ohio."  We assume that the mortgagee\'s address could have been ascertained by reasonably diligent efforts.  <em>See Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</em> 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#317">339 U. S. 317</a></span>.  Simply mailing a letter to "Mennonite Board of Missions, Wayne County, Ohio," quite likely would have provided actual notice, given "the well-known skill of postal officials and employes in making proper delivery of letters defectively addressed."  <em>Grannis v.

We do not suggest, however, that a governmental body is required to undertake extraordinary efforts to discover the identity and whereabouts of a mortgagee whose identity is not in the public record.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, notice by mail to the mortgagee may ultimately relieve the county of a more substantial administrative burden if the mortgagee arranges for payment of the delinquent taxes prior to the tax sale.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>This appeal also presents the question whether, before the County Auditor executes and delivers a deed to the tax sale purchaser, the mortgagee is constitutionally entitled to notice of its right to redeem the property.  <em>Cf.

It is the primary responsibility of the State to strike this balance, and we will upset this process only when the State strikes the balance in an irrational manner.</p>\n<p>From <em>Mullane</em> on, the Court has adamantly refused to commit</p>\n<p>"itself to any formula achieving a balance between these interests in a particular proceeding or determining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="802">Page 462 U.

Our approach in these cases has always reflected the general principle that "[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation."  <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers v.

The Court now holds that, <em>whenever</em> a party has a legally protected property interest,</p>\n<p>"[n]otice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice is a minimum constitutional precondition to a proceeding which will adversely affect the liberty or property interests . . . if [the party\'s] name and address are reasonably ascertainable."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#800">462 U. S. 800</a></span>.  Without knowing what state and individual interests will be at stake in future cases, the Court espouses a general principle ostensibly applicable whenever <em>any</em> legally protected property interest may be adversely affected.  This is a flat rejection of the view that no "formula" can be devised that adequately evaluates the constitutionality of a procedure created by a State to provide notice in a certain class of cases.  Despite the fact that <em>Mullane</em> itself accepted that constructive notice satisfied the dictates of due process in certain circumstances, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="803">Page 462 U. S. 803</a></p><p> Court, citing <em>Mullane,</em> now holds that constructive notice can <em>never</em> suffice whenever there is a legally protected property interest at stake.</p>\n<p>In seeking to justify this broad rule, the Court holds that, although a party\'s inability to safeguard its interests may result in imposing greater notice burdens on the State, the fact that a party may be more able "to safeguard its interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#799">462 U. S. 799</a></span>.  Apart from ignoring the fact that it is the totality of circumstances that determines the sufficiency of notice, the Court also neglects to consider that the constitutional obligation imposed upon the State may itself be defined by the party\'s ability to protect its interest.  As recently as last Term, the Court held that the focus of the due process inquiry has always been the effect of a notice procedure on "a particular class of cases."  <em>Greene, supra,</em> at 451 (emphasis added). In fashioning a broad rule for "the least sophisticated creditor," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/798/case.html#799">456 U. S. 799</a></span>, the Court ignores the well-settled principle that</p>\n<p>"procedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions."</p>\n<p><em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#344">424 U. S. 344</a></span>; <em>see also Califano v.

If the members of a particular class generally possess the ability to safeguard their interests, then this fact must be taken into account when we consider the "totality of circumstances," as required by <em>Mullane.</em>  Indeed, the criterion established by <em>Mullane</em> "<em>is not the possibility of conceivable injury, but the just and reasonable character of the requirements, having reference to the subject with which the statute deals.\'"  339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#315">339 U.

The Court reasons that, before <em>Mullane,</em> the characterization of proceedings as <em>in personam</em> or <em>in rem</em> was relevant to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="804">Page 462 U. S. 804</a></p><p> determining whether the notice given was constitutionally sufficient, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and that, once <em>Mullane</em> held that the "power of the State to resort to constructive service" no longer depended upon the "historic antithesis" of <em>in rem</em> and <em>in personam</em> proceedings, 339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#312">339 U. S. 312</a></span>-313, constructive notice became insufficient as to <em>all</em> proceedings.</p>\n<p>The plain language of <em>Mullane</em> is clear that the Court expressly refused to reject constructive notice as <em>per se</em> insufficient.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#312">339 U.

Moreover, the Court errs in thinking that the only justification for constructive notice is the distinction between types of proceedings.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#796">462 U. S. 796</a></span>-797, n. 3.  The historical justification for constructive notice was that those with an interest in property were under an obligation to act reasonably in keeping themselves informed of proceedings that affected that property.  <em>See, e.g., North Laramie Land Co. v.

As discussed in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#805">462 U.

In applying this requirement to the mortgagee in this case, the Court holds that the State must exercise "reasonably diligent efforts" in determining the address of the mortgagee, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#798">462 U.

S. 798</a></span>.  This uncertainty becomes particularly ominous in the light of the fact that the duty to ascertain identity and location, and to notify by mail or other similar means, exists whenever any legally protected interest is implicated.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Once the Court effectively rejects <em>Mullane</em> and its progeny by accepting a <em>per se</em> rule against constructive notice, it applies its rule and holds that the mortgagee in this case must receive personal service or mailed notice because it has a legally protected interest at stake, and because the mortgage was publicly recorded.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/791/case.html#798">462 U. S. 798</a></span>.  If the Court had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="806">Page 462 U. S. 806</a></p><p> observed its prior decisions and engaged in the balancing required by <em>Mullane,</em> it would have reached the opposite result.</p>\n<p>It cannot be doubted that the State has a vital interest in the collection of its tax revenues in whatever reasonable manner that it chooses:</p>\n<p>"In authorizing the proceedings to enforce the payment of the taxes upon lands sold to a purchaser at tax sale, the State is in exercise of its sovereign power to raise revenue essential to carry on the affairs of state and the due administration of the laws. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The process of taxation does not require the same kind of notice as is required in a suit at law, or even in proceedings for taking private property under the power of eminent domain."</p>\n<p><em>Leigh v. Green,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/193/79/case.html">193 U. S. 79</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/193/79/case.html#89">193 U. S. 89</a></span> (1904) (quoting <em>Bell\'s Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/232/case.html">134 U.

The State has decided to accommodate its vital interest in this respect through the sale of real property on which payments of property taxes have been delinquent for a certain period of time. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The State has an equally strong interest in avoiding the burden imposed by the requirement that it must exercise "reasonable" efforts to ascertain the identity and location of any party with a legally protected interest.  In the instant case, that burden is not limited to mailing notice.  Rather, the State must have someone check the records and ascertain with respect to each delinquent taxpayer whether there is a mortgagee, perhaps whether the mortgage has been paid off, and whether there is a dependable address.</p>\n<p>Against these vital interests of the State, we must weigh the interest possessed by the relevant class -- in this case, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="807">Page 462 U. S. 807</a></p><p> mortgagees. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Contrary to the Court\'s approach today, this interest may not be evaluated simply by reference to the fact that we have frequently found constructive notice to be inadequate since <em>Mullane.</em>  Rather, such interest "must be judged in the light of its practical application to the affairs of men as they are ordinarily conducted."  <em>North Laramie Land Co.,</em> 268 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/276/case.html#283">268 U. S. 283</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall wrote long ago that</p>\n<p>"it is the part of common prudence for all those who have any interest in [property], to guard that interest by persons who are in a situation to protect it."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/13/126/case.html">The Mary, 9 Cranch,</a></span></em> 126,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/13/126/case.html#144">13 U. S. 144</a></span> (1815).  We have never rejected this principle, and, indeed, we held in <em>Mullane</em> that "[a] state may indulge" the assumption that a property owner "usually arranges means to learn of any direct attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights."  339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#316">339 U. S. 316</a></span>.  When we have found constructive notice to be inadequate, it has always been where an owner of property is, for all purposes, <em>unable</em> to protect his interest because there is no practical way for him to learn of state action that threatens to affect his property interest.  In each case, the adverse action was one that was completely unexpected by the owner, and the owner would become aware of the action only by the fortuitous occasion of reading</p>\n<p>"an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper [that may] not even name those whose attention it is supposed to attract, and does not inform acquaintances who might call it to attention."</p>\n<p><em>Mullane, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#315">339 U. S. 315</a></span>.  In each case, the individuals had no reason to expect that their property interests were being affected.</p>\n<p>This is not the case as far as tax sales and mortgagees are concerned.  Unlike condemnation or an unexpected accounting, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="808">Page 462 U. S. 808</a></p><p> the assessment of taxes occurs with regularity and predictability, and the state action in this case cannot reasonably be characterized as unexpected in any sense.  Unlike the parties in our other cases, the Mennonite Board had a regular event, the assessment of taxes, upon which to focus, in its effort to protect its interest.  Further, approximately 95% of the mortgage debt outstanding in the United States is held by private institutional lenders and federally supported agencies.  U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States:  1982-1983, p. 511 (103d ed.). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  It is highly unlikely, if likely at all, that a significant number of mortgagees are unaware of the consequences that ensue when their mortgagors fail to pay taxes assessed on the mortgaged property.  Indeed, in this case, the Board itself required that Moore pay all property taxes.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the Board could have safeguarded its interest with a minimum amount of effort.  The county auctions of property commence by statute on the second Monday of each year.  Ind.Code \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-2(5) (1982).  The county auditor is required to post notice in the county courthouse at least three weeks before the date of sale.  \xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-3(a).  The auditor is also required to publish notice in two different newspapers once each week for three weeks before the sale.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6-1.1-24-3(a), 6-1.1-22-4(b).  The Board could have supplemented the protection offered by the State with the additional measures suggested by the court below:   the Board could have required that Moore provide it with copies of paid tax assessments, or could have required </p><p><a class="page-number" name="809">Page 462 U. S. 809</a></p><p> that Moore deposit the tax moneys in an escrow account, or could have itself checked the public records to determine whether the tax assessment had been paid.  427 N.E.2d 686, 690, n. 9 (1981).</p>\n<p>When a party is unreasonable in failing to protect its interest despite its ability to do so, due process does not require that the State save the party from its own lack of care.  The balance required by <em>Mullane</em> clearly weighs in favor of finding that the Indiana statutes satisfied the requirements of due process.  Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Mullane v.

This language must be read in the light of the facts of <em>Mullane,</em> in which the identity and location of certain beneficiaries were actually known.  In addition, the Court in <em>Mullane</em> expressly rejected the view that a search "under ordinary standards of diligence" was required in that case.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#317">339 U.

This is certainly true; however, that does not change the fact that, even if the Board is not a professional moneylender, it voluntarily entered into a fairly sophisticated transaction with Moore.
