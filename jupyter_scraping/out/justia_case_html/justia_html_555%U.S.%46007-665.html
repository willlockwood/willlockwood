In rejecting the request of respondent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the City\xe2\x80\x99s history or donated by groups with longstanding community ties.  After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, respondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monument\xe2\x80\x99s historical significance or respondent\xe2\x80\x99s connection to the community.  The City rejected the request, and respondent filed suit, claiming that the City and petitioner officials had violated the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments monument but rejecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed monument.  The District Court denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary injunction request, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  Noting that it had previously found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than government speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded as public forums, the court held that, because the exclusion of the monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was required to erect it immediately.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.

Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public.  Thus, a government-commissioned and government-financed monument placed on public land constitutes government speech.  So, too, are privately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts for public display on government land.  While government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of selective receptivity.  Because city parks play an important role in defining the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting those that portray what the government decisionmakers view as appropriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and local culture.  The accepted monuments are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message and thus constitute government speech.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Here, the Park\xe2\x80\x99s monuments clearly represent government speech.  Although many were donated in completed form by private entities, the City has \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively controlled\xe2\x80\x9d their messages by exercising \xe2\x80\x9cfinal approval authority\xe2\x80\x9d over their selection.  <em>Johanns</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 560\xe2\x80\x93561.  The City has selected monuments that present the image that the City wishes to project to Park visitors; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument; and it has now expressly set out selection criteria.  P.\xc2\xa010.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate concern that the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints does not mean that a government entity should be required to embrace publicly a privately donated monument\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmessage\xe2\x80\x9d in order to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.  A city engages in expressive conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument, but it does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument.  A government\xe2\x80\x99s message may be altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity.  It may also change over time.

S. 194</a>, 205.  The forum doctrine applies where a government property or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or program, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.  If governments must maintain viewpoint neutrality in selecting donated monuments, they must either prepare for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments.  Were public parks considered traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.  And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the forum, forum analysis is out of place.  <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.</em> v. <em>Pinette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/753/index.html">515 U.

The Court of Appeals held that the municipality was required to accept the monument because a public park is a traditional public forum.  We conclude, however, that although a park is a traditional public forum for speeches and other transitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in a public park is not a form of expression to which forum analysis applies.  Instead, the placement of a permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.  </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5 acre public park located in the Historic District of Pleasant Grove City (or City) in Utah.  The Park currently contains 15 permanent displays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups or individuals.  These include an historic granary, a wishing well, the City\xe2\x80\x99s first fire station, a September 11 monument, and a Ten Commandments monument donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Summum is a religious organization founded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.  On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum\xe2\x80\x99s president wrote a letter to the City\xe2\x80\x99s mayor requesting permission to erect a \xe2\x80\x9cstone monument,\xe2\x80\x9d which would contain \xe2\x80\x9cthe Seven Aphorisms of SUMMUM\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and be similar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments monument.  App. 57, 59.  The City denied the requests and explained that its practice was to limit monuments in the Park to those that \xe2\x80\x9ceither (1) directly relate to the history of Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups with longstanding ties to the Pleasant Grove community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 61.  The following year, the City passed a resolution putting this policy into writing.  The resolution also mentioned other criteria, such as safety and esthetics. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2005, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s president again wrote to the mayor asking to erect a monument, but the letter did not describe the monument, its historical significance, or Summum\xe2\x80\x99s connection to the community.  The city council rejected this request.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, respondent filed this action against the City and various local officials (petitioners), asserting, among other claims, that petitioners had violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten Commandments monument but rejecting the proposed Seven Aphorisms monument.  Respondent sought a preliminary injunction directing the City to permit Summum to erect its monument in Pioneer Park.  After the District Court denied Summum\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary injunction request, No. 2:05CV00638, 2006 WL 3421838 (D Utah, Nov. 22, 2006), respondent appealed, pressing solely its free speech claim. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed.  483 F.\xc2\xa03d 1044 (2007).  The panel noted that it had previously found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than government speech.  See <em>Summum</em> v. <em>Ogden</em>, 297 F.\xc2\xa03d 995 (2002).  Noting that public parks have traditionally been regarded as public forums, the panel held that the City could not reject the Seven Aphorisms monument unless it had a compelling justification that could not be served by more narrowly tailored means.  See 483 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1054.  The panel then concluded that the exclusion of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s monument was unlikely to survive this strict scrutiny, and the panel therefore held that the City was required to erect Summum\xe2\x80\x99s monument immediately.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit denied the City\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote.  499 F.\xc2\xa03d 1170 (2007).  Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that the Park was not a traditional public forum for the purpose of displaying monuments.  <em>Id</em>., at 1171.  Judge McConnell also dissented, contending that the monuments in the Park constitute government speech.  <em>Id</em>., at 1174.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No prior decision of this Court has addressed the application of the Free Speech Clause to a government entity\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of privately donated, permanent monuments for installation in a public park, and the parties disagree sharply about the line of precedents that governs this situation.  Petitioners contend that the pertinent cases are those concerning government speech.  Respondent, on the other hand, agrees with the Court of Appeals panel that the applicable cases are those that analyze private speech in a public forum.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 fundamental disagreement thus centers on the nature of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct when they permitted privately donated monuments to be erected in Pioneer Park.  Were petitioners engaging in their own expressive conduct?  Or were they providing a forum for private speech?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If petitioners were engaging in their own expressive conduct, then the Free Speech Clause has no application.

See <em>id.</em>, at 562 (opinion of the Court) (where the government controls the message, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not precluded from relying on the government-speech doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Rosenberger</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 833 (a government entity may \xe2\x80\x9cregulate the content of what is or is not expressed \xe2\x80\xa6 when it enlists private entities to convey its own message\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This does not mean that there are no restraints on government speech.  For example, government speech must comport with the Establishment Clause.  The involvement of public officials in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or practice.

S. 98</a>, 106\xe2\x80\x93107 (2001). </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There may be situations in which it is difficult to tell whether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf or is providing a forum for private speech, but this case does not present such a situation.  Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically represent government speech.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public.  Since ancient times, kings, emperors, and other rulers have erected statues of themselves to remind their subjects of their authority and power.  Triumphal arches, columns, and other monuments have been built to commemorate military victories and sacrifices and other events of civic importance.  A monument, by definition, is a structure that is designed as a means of expression.  When a government entity arranges for the construction of a monument, it does so because it wishes to convey some thought or instill some feeling in those who see the structure.  Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent disputes the obvious proposition that a monument that is commissioned and financed by a government body for placement on public land constitutes government speech.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as government-commissioned and government-financed monuments speak for the government, so do privately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts and displays to the public on government land.  It certainly is not common for property owners to open up their property for the installation of permanent monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish to be associated.  And because property owners typically do not permit the construction of such monuments on their land, persons who observe donated monuments routinely\xe2\x80\x94and reasonably\xe2\x80\x94interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  In this context, there is little chance that observers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker.  This is true whether the monument is located on private property or on public property, such as national, state, or city park land.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the general government practice with respect to donated monuments has been one of selective receptivity.  A great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s public parks were financed with private funds or donated by private parties.  Sites managed by the National Park Service contain thousands of privately designed or funded commemorative objects, including the Statue of Liberty, the Marine Corps War Memorial (the Iwo Jima monument), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  States and cities likewise have received thousands of donated monuments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Brief for International Municipal Lawyers Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15a\xe2\x80\x9329a (hereinafter IMLA Brief) (listing examples); Brief for American Legion et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7, and n. 2 (same).  By accepting monuments that are privately funded or donated, government entities save tax dollars and are able to acquire monuments that they could not have afforded to fund on their own.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But while government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated monuments, they have exercised selectivity.  An example discussed by the city of New York as <em>amicus curiae</em> is illustrative.  In the wake of the controversy generated in 1876 when the city turned down a donated monument to honor Daniel Webster, the city adopted rules governing the acceptance of artwork for permanent placement in city parks, requiring, among other things, that \xe2\x80\x9cany proposed gift of art had to be viewed either in its finished condition or as a model before acceptance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for City of New York as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x935 (hereinafter NYC Brief).  Across the country, \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipalities generally exercise editorial control over donated monuments through prior submission requirements, design input, requested modifications, written criteria, and legislative approvals of specific content proposals.\xe2\x80\x9d  IMLA Brief 21. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Public parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government unit that owns the land.  City parks\xe2\x80\x94ranging from those in small towns, like Pioneer Park in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major metropolises, like Central Park in New York City\xe2\x80\x94commonly play an important role in defining the identity that a city projects to its own residents and to the outside world.  Accordingly, cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.  Government decisionmakers select the monuments that portray what they view as appropriate for the place in question, taking into account such content-based factors as esthetics, history, and local culture.  The monuments that are accepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message, and they thus constitute government speech.  </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove\xe2\x80\x99s Pioneer Park represent government speech.  Although many of the monuments were not designed or built by the City and were donated in completed form by private entities, the City decided to accept those donations and to display them in the Park.  Respondent does not claim that the City ever opened up the Park for the placement of whatever permanent monuments might be offered by private donors.  Rather, the City has \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively controlled\xe2\x80\x9d the messages sent by the monuments in the Park by exercising \xe2\x80\x9cfinal approval authority\xe2\x80\x9d over their selection.  <em>Johanns</em>, 544 U. S., at 560\xe2\x80\x93561.  The City has selected those monuments that it wants to display for the purpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes to project to all who frequent the Park; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s concern; and the City has now expressly set forth the criteria it will use in making future selections.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent voices the legitimate concern that the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suggested solution is to require a government entity accepting a privately donated monument to go through a formal process of adopting a resolution publicly embracing \xe2\x80\x9cthe message\xe2\x80\x9d that the monument conveys.  See Brief for Respondent 33\xe2\x80\x9334, 57.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no reason for imposing a requirement of this sort.  The parks of this country contain thousands of donated monuments that government entities have used for their own expressive purposes, usually without producing the sort of formal documentation that respondent now says is required to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.  Requiring all of these jurisdictions to go back and proclaim formally that they adopt all of these monuments as their own expressive vehicles would be a pointless exercise that the Constitution does not mandate.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, for example, although respondent argues that Pleasant Grove City has not adequately \xe2\x80\x9ccontroll[ed] the message,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 31, of the Ten Commandments monument, the City took ownership of that monument and put it on permanent display in a park that it owns and manages and that is linked to the City\xe2\x80\x99s identity.  All rights previously possessed by the monument\xe2\x80\x99s donor have been relinquished.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s actions provided a more dramatic form of adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that respondent would demand, unmistakably signifying to all Park visitors that the City intends the monument to speak on its behalf.  And the City has made no effort to abridge the traditional free speech rights\xe2\x80\x94the right to speak, distribute leaflets, etc.\xe2\x80\x94that may be exercised by respondent and others in Pioneer Park. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What respondent demands, however, is that the City \xe2\x80\x9cadopt\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cembrace\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe message\xe2\x80\x9d that it associates with the monument.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9334, 57.  Respondent seems to think that a monument can convey only one \xe2\x80\x9cmessage\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is, presumably, the message intended by the donor\xe2\x80\x94and that, if a government entity that accepts a monument for placement on its property does not formally embrace <em>that</em> message, then the government has not engaged in expressive conduct.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument fundamentally misunderstands the way monuments convey meaning.  The meaning conveyed by a monument is generally not a simple one like \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Beef.  It\xe2\x80\x99s What\xe2\x80\x99s for Dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johanns</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 554.  Even when a monument features the written word, the monument may be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be interpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways.  Monuments called to our attention by the briefing in this case illustrate this phenomenon. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What, for example, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe message\xe2\x80\x9d of the Greco-Roman mosaic of the word \xe2\x80\x9cImagine\xe2\x80\x9d that was donated to New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Central Park in memory of John Lennon?  See NYC Brief 18; App. to <em>id.</em>, at A5.  Some observers may \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\xe2\x80\x9d the musical contributions that John Lennon would have made if he had not been killed.  Others may think of the lyrics of the Lennon song that obviously inspired the mosaic and may \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\xe2\x80\x9d a world without religion, countries, possessions, greed, or hunger.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Or, to take another example, what is \xe2\x80\x9cthe message\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9clarge bronze statue displaying the word \xe2\x80\x98peace\xe2\x80\x99 in many world languages\xe2\x80\x9d that is displayed in Fayetteville, Arkansas?[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These text-based monuments are almost certain to evoke different thoughts and sentiments in the minds of different observers, and the effect of monuments that do not contain text is likely to be even more variable.  Consider, for example, the statue of Pancho Villa that was given to the city of Tucson, Arizona, in 1981 by the Government of Mexico with, according to a Tucson publication, \xe2\x80\x9ca wry sense of irony.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Does this statue commemorate a \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionary leader who advocated for agrarian reform and the poor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca violent bandit\xe2\x80\x9d?  IMLA Brief 13. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s apparent belief, it frequently is not possible to identify a single \xe2\x80\x9cmessage\xe2\x80\x9d that is conveyed by an object or structure, and consequently, the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and displays such an object may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  By accepting a privately donated monument and placing it on city property, a city engages in expressive conduct, but the intended and perceived significance of that conduct may not coincide with the thinking of the monument\xe2\x80\x99s donor or creator.  Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is funded by many small donations, the donors themselves may differ in their interpretation of the monument\xe2\x80\x99s significance.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  By accepting such a monument, a government entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The message that a government entity conveys by allowing a monument to remain on its property may also be altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity.  For example, following controversy over the original design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a compromise was reached that called for the nearby addition of a flagstaff and bronze Three Soldiers statue, which many believed changed the overall effect of the memorial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Mayo, War Memorials as Political Landscape: The American Experience and Beyond 202\xe2\x80\x93203, 205 (1988); K. Hass, Carried to the Wall: American Memory and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 15\xe2\x80\x9318 (1998). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cmessage\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed by a monument may change over time.  A study of war memorials found that \xe2\x80\x9cpeople reinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of these memorials as \xe2\x80\x9chistorical interpretations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe society around them changes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mayo, <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A striking example of how the interpretation of a monument can evolve is provided by one of the most famous and beloved public monuments in the United States, the Statue of Liberty.  The statue was given to this country by the Third French Republic to express republican solidarity and friendship between the two countries.  See J. Res. 6, 44th Cong., 2d Sess. (1877), 19 Stat. 410 (accepting the statue as an \xe2\x80\x9cexpressive and felicitous memorial of the sympathy of the citizens of our sister Republic\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the inaugural ceremony, President Cleveland saw the statue as an emblem of international friendship and the widespread influence of American ideals.  See Inauguration of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World 30 (1887).  Only later did the statue come to be viewed as a beacon welcoming immigrants to a land of freedom.  See Public Papers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. 2, July 3, 1986, pp. 918\xe2\x80\x93919 (1989), Remarks at the Opening Ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty Centennial Celebration in New York, New York; J. Higham, The Transformation of the Statue of Liberty, in Send These To Me 74\xe2\x80\x9380 (rev. ed. 1984).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and the Court of Appeals analogize the installation of permanent monuments in a public park to the delivery of speeches and the holding of marches and demonstrations, and they thus invoke the rule that a public park is a traditional public forum for these activities.  But \xe2\x80\x9cpublic forum principles . . . are out of place in the context of this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Library Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/194/index.html">539 U. S. 194</a>, 205 (2003).  The forum doctrine has been applied in situations in which government-owned property or a government program was capable of accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or the program.  For example, a park can accommodate many speakers and, over time, many parades and demonstrations.  The Combined Federal Campaign permits hundreds of groups to solicit donations from federal employees.  See <em>Cornelius</em>, 473 U. S., at 804\xe2\x80\x93805.  A public university\xe2\x80\x99s student activity fund can provide money for many campus activities.  See <em>Rosenberger</em>, 515 U. S., at 825.  A public university\xe2\x80\x99s buildings may offer meeting space for hundreds of student groups.  See <em>Widmar</em> v. <em>Vincent</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/263/index.html">454 U. S. 263</a>, 274\xe2\x80\x93275 (1981).  A school system\xe2\x80\x99s internal mail facilities can support the transmission of many messages to and from teachers and school administrators.  See <em>Perry Ed. Assn.</em>, 460 U. S., at 39, 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  See also <em>Arkansas Ed.

Public parks have been used, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98time out of mind, . . . for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Perry Ed. Assn.</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 45 (quoting <em>Hague</em>, 307 U. S., at 515), but \xe2\x80\x9cone would be hard pressed to find a \xe2\x80\x98long tradition\xe2\x80\x99 of allowing people to permanently occupy public space with any manner of monuments.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1173 (Lucero, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Speakers, no matter how long-winded, eventually come to the end of their remarks; persons distributing leaflets and carrying signs at some point tire and go home; monuments, however, endure.  They monopolize the use of the land on which they stand and interfere permanently with other uses of public space.  A public park, over the years, can provide a soapbox for a very large number of orators\xe2\x80\x94often, for all who want to speak\xe2\x80\x94but it is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent contends that this issue \xe2\x80\x9ccan be dealt with through content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions, including the option of a ban on all unattended displays.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 14.  On this view, when France presented the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1884, this country had the option of either (a) declining France\xe2\x80\x99s offer or (b) accepting the gift, but providing a comparable location in the harbor of New York for other statues of a similar size and nature (<em>e.g.</em>, a Statue of Autocracy, if one had been offered by, say, the German Empire or Imperial Russia).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While respondent and some of its <em>amici</em> deride the fears expressed about the consequences of the Court of Appeals holding in this case, those concerns are well founded.  If government entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality in their selection of donated monuments, they must either \xe2\x80\x9cbrace themselves for an influx of clutter\xe2\x80\x9d or face the pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments.  See 499 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1175 (McConnell, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Every jurisdiction that has accepted a donated war memorial may be asked to provide equal treatment for a donated monument questioning the cause for which the veterans fought.  New York City, having accepted a donated statue of one heroic dog (Balto, the sled dog who brought medicine to Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic)[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] may be pressed to accept monuments for other dogs who are claimed to be equally worthy of commemoration.  The obvious truth of the matter is that if public parks were considered to be traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.  And where the application of forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the forum, it is obvious that forum analysis is out of place. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent compares the present case to <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.</em> v. <em>Pinette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/753/index.html">515 U. S. 753</a> (1995), but that case involved a very different situation\xe2\x80\x94a request by a private group, the Ku Klux Klan, to erect a cross for a period of 16 days on public property that had been opened up for similar temporary displays, including a Christmas tree and a menorah.  See <em>id</em>., at 758.  Although some public parks can accommodate and may be made generally available for temporary private displays, the same is rarely true for permanent monuments. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, there are limited circumstances in which the forum doctrine might properly be applied to a permanent monument\xe2\x80\x94for example, if a town created a monument on which all of its residents (or all those meeting some other criterion) could place the name of a person to be honored or some other private message.  But as a general matter, forum analysis simply does not apply to the installation of permanent monuments on public property.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we hold that the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision to accept certain privately donated monuments while rejecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s is best viewed as a form of government speech.  As a result, the City\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not subject to the Free Speech Clause, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.

While I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive opinion, I think the reasons justifying the city\xe2\x80\x99s refusal would have been equally valid if its acceptance of the monument, instead of being characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech,\xe2\x80\x9d had merely been deemed an implicit endorsement of the donor\xe2\x80\x99s message.  See <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.</em> v. <em>Pinette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/753/index.html">515 U. S. 753</a>, 801\xe2\x80\x93802 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To date, our decisions relying on the recently minted government speech doctrine to uphold government action have been few and, in my view, of doubtful merit.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Garcetti</em> v. <em>Ceballos</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/410/index.html">547 U. S. 410</a> (2006); <em>Johanns</em> v. <em>Livestock Marketing Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/550/index.html">544 U. S. 550</a> (2005); <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U. S. 173</a> (1991).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case signals no expansion of that doctrine.  And by joining the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I do not mean to indicate agreement with our earlier decisions.  Unlike other decisions relying on the government speech doctrine, our decision in this case excuses no retaliation for, or coercion of, private speech.  Cf. <em>Garcetti</em>, 547 U. S., at 438 (Souter, J., dissenting); <em>Rust</em>, 500 U. S., at 212 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Nor is it likely, given the near certainty that observers will associate permanent displays with the governmental property owner, that the government will be able to avoid political accountability for the views that it endorses or expresses through this means.  Cf. <em>Johanns</em>, 544 U. S., at 571\xe2\x80\x93572 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Finally, recognizing permanent displays on public property as government speech will not give the government free license to communicate offensive or partisan messages.  For even if the Free Speech Clause neither restricts nor protects government speech, government speakers are bound by the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s other proscriptions, including those supplied by the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses.  Together with the checks imposed by our democratic processes, these constitutional safeguards ensure that the effect of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be limited.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962833">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nPLEASANT GROVE CITY V. SUMMUM<br/>\n555 U.

See <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System </em>v. <em>Southworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/217/index.html">529 U. S. 217</a>, 235 (2000) (noting government speech may \xe2\x80\x9cpromote [government\xe2\x80\x99s] own policies or . . . advance a particular idea\xe2\x80\x9d).  And although the government should lose when the character of the speech is at issue and its governmental nature has not been made clear, see <em>Johanns</em> v. <em>Livestock Marketing Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/550/index.html">544 U. S. 550</a>, 577 (2005) (Souter, J., dissenting), I also agree with the Court that the city need not satisfy the particular formality urged by Summum as a condition of recognizing that the expression here falls within the public category.  I have qualms, however, about accepting the position that public monuments are government speech categorically.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cJust as government-commissioned and government-financed monuments speak for the government, so do privately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts and displays to the public on government land\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the government speech doctrine, as Justice Stevens notes, <em>ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion), is \xe2\x80\x9crecently minted,\xe2\x80\x9d it would do well for us to go slow in setting its bounds, which will affect existing doctrine in ways not yet explored.  Even though, for example, Establishment Clause issues have been neither raised nor briefed before us, there is no doubt that this case and its government speech claim has been litigated by the parties with one eye on the Establishment Clause, see <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring).  The interaction between the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d and Establishment Clause principles has not, however, begun to be worked out.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case shows that it may not be easy to work out.  After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, whenever a government maintains a monument it will presumably be understood to be engaging in government speech.  If the monument has some religious character, the specter of violating the Establishment Clause will behoove it to take care to avoid the appearance of a flat-out establishment of religion, in the sense of the government\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the tenets expressed or symbolized.  In such an instance, there will be safety in numbers, and it will be in the interest of a careful government to accept other monuments to stand nearby, to dilute the appearance of adopting whatever particular religious position the single example alone might stand for.  As mementoes and testimonials pile up, however, the chatter may well make it less intuitively obvious that the government is speaking in its own right simply by maintaining the monuments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a case like that occurred, as suspicion grew that some of the permanent displays were not government speech at all (or at least had an equally private character associated with private donors), a further Establishment Clause prohibition would surface, the bar against preferring some religious speakers over others.  See <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Jaffree</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a>, 113 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Clause was also designed to stop the Federal Government from asserting a preference for one religious denomination or sect over others\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the government could well argue, as a development of government speech doctrine, that when it expresses its own views, it is free of the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s stricture against discriminating among religious sects or groups.  Under this view of the relationship between the two doctrines, it would be easy for a government to favor some private religious speakers over others by its choice of monuments to accept.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether that view turns out to be sound is more than I can say at this point.  It is simply unclear how the relatively new category of government speech will relate to the more traditional categories of Establishment Clause analysis, and this case is not an occasion to speculate.  It is an occasion, however, to try to keep the inevitable issues open, and as simple as they can be.  One way to do that is to recognize that there are circumstances in which government maintenance of monuments does not look like government speech at all.  Sectarian identifications on markers in Arlington Cemetery come to mind.  And to recognize that is to forgo any categorical rule at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To avoid relying on a <em>per se</em> rule to say when speech is governmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to ask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer would understand the expression to be government speech, as distinct from private speech the government chooses to oblige by allowing the monument to be placed on public land.  This reasonable observer test for governmental character is of a piece with the one for spotting forbidden governmental endorsement of religion in the Establishment Clause cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 630, 635\xe2\x80\x93636 (1989) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The adoption of it would thus serve coherence within Establishment Clause law, and it would make sense of our common understanding that some monuments on public land display religious symbolism that clearly does not express a government\xe2\x80\x99s chosen views.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of this observer test provides the reason I find the monument here to be government expression.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962832">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n555 U.

I do so, however, on the understanding that the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine is a rule of thumb, not a rigid category.  Were the City to discriminate in the selection of permanent monuments on grounds unrelated to the display\xe2\x80\x99s theme, say solely on political grounds, its action might well violate the First Amendment.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     In my view, courts must apply categories such as \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpublic forums,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9climited public forums,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonpublic forums\xe2\x80\x9d with an eye towards their purposes\xe2\x80\x94lest we turn \xe2\x80\x9cfree speech\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine into a jurisprudence of labels.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Kokinda</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/720/index.html">497 U. S. 720</a>, 740\xe2\x80\x93743 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Consequently, we must sometimes look beyond an initial categorization.  And, in doing so, it helps to ask whether a government action burdens speech disproportionately in light of the action\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to further a legitimate government objective.  See, e.g., <em>Ysursa </em>v. <em>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Nixon </em>v.<em> Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 404 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n     Were we to do so here, we would find\xe2\x80\x94for reasons that the Court sets forth\xe2\x80\x94that the City\xe2\x80\x99s action, while preventing Summum from erecting its monument, does not disproportionately restrict Summum\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of expression.  The City has not closed off its parks to speech; no one claims that the City prevents Summum\xe2\x80\x99s members from engaging in speech in a form more transient than a permanent monument.  Rather, the City has simply reserved some space in the park for projects designed to further other than free-speech goals.  And that is perfectly proper.  After all, parks do not serve speech-related interests alone.  To the contrary, cities use park space to further a variety of recreational, historical, educational, aesthetic, and other civic interests.  To reserve to the City the power to pick and choose among proposed monuments according to criteria reasonably related to one or more of these legitimate ends restricts Summum\xe2\x80\x99s expression, but, given  the impracticality of alternatives and viewed in light of the City\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate needs, the restriction is not disproportionate.  Analyzed either way, as \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech\xe2\x80\x9d or as a proportionate restriction on Summum\xe2\x80\x99s expression, the City\xe2\x80\x99s action here is lawful. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962831">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nPLEASANT GROVE CITY V.

I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of that question and join its opinion in full.  But it is also obvious that from the start, the case has been litigated in the shadow of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Establishment</em> Clause: the city wary of associating itself too closely with the Ten Commandments monument displayed in the park, lest that be deemed a breach in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwall of separation between church and State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/98/145/index.html">98 U.

Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s intimations, there are very good reasons to be confident that\nthe park displays do not violate <em>any</em> part of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Van Orden</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/677/index.html">545 U.

Nothing in that decision suggested that the outcome turned on a finding that the monument was only \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d speech.  To the contrary, all the Justices agreed that government speech was at issue, but the Establishment Clause argument was nonetheless rejected.  For the plurality, that was because the Ten Commandments \xe2\x80\x9chave an undeniable historical meaning\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to their \xe2\x80\x9creligious significance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 690 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment, agreed that the monument conveyed a permissible secular message, as evidenced by its location in a park that contained multiple monuments and historical markers; by the fact that it had been donated by the Eagles \xe2\x80\x9cas part of that organization\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to combat juvenile delinquency\xe2\x80\x9d; and by the length of time (40 years) for which the monument had gone unchallenged.  <em>Id.</em>, at 701\xe2\x80\x93703.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 739\xe2\x80\x93740 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even accepting the narrowest reading of the narrowest opinion necessary to the judgment in <em>Van Orden</em>, there is little basis to distinguish the monument in this case: Pioneer Park includes \xe2\x80\x9c15 permanent displays,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932; it was donated by the Eagles as part of its national effort to combat juvenile delinquency, Brief for Respondent 3; and it was erected in 1971, <em>ibid.</em>, which means it is approaching its (momentous!) 40th anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city can safely exhale.
