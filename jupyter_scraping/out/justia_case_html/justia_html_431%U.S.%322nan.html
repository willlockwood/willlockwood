[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  After he was found guilty, he pursued his right to <em>de novo</em> review and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court granted direct appellate review and ordered the complaint dismissed on the ground that the statute violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 431 U. S. 323</a></p><p> of the United States Constitution, Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 3, cl. 2.  344 N.E.2d 411.  We granted certiorari.  429 U.S. 815 (1976).</p>\n<p>Our decision today in <em>Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/265/case.html">431 U. S. 265</a></span>, suggests that there may be a statutory basis to provide respondent the relief he seeks, thereby making it unnecessary to decide the constitutional question presented.  Douglas holds that federal law preempts the States from denying vessels that are federally enrolled and licensed for the fisheries the right to fish in state waters on the same terms as state residents.  Respondent\'s vessel is federally enrolled and licensed "to be employed in carrying on the mackerel fishery," the same license that was held by appellees in <em>Douglas.</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In accordance with our longstanding principle of deciding constitutional questions only when necessary, <em>Hagans v.

The parties were given an opportunity to comment on the propriety of our taking notice of the license, and both sides agreed that we could properly do so.  <em>See</em> supplemental briefs filed by the parties.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
