S. 105</a></p><p> jurisdiction to try the action and render judgment therein against the defendant?"</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This action was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York against the Barrow Steamship Company, by a passenger on one of its steamships on a voyage from Londonderry, in Ireland, to the City of New York, for an assault upon him by its agents in the port of Londonderry.  The certificate of the circuit court of appeals shows that the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the State of New Jersey; that the defendant is a corporation organized and incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and a common carrier running a line of steamships from ports in that kingdom to the port of New York, and does business in the State of New York, through a mercantile firm, its regularly appointed agents, and upon whom the summons in this action was served.</p>\n<p>It was contended in behalf of the steamship company that, being a foreign corporation, no suit could be maintained against it <em>in personam</em> in this country without its consent, express or implied; that, by doing business in the State of New York, it consented to be sued only as authorized by the statutes of the state; that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States held within the state depended on the authority given by those statutes; that the statutes of New York conferred no authority upon any court to issue process against a foreign corporation in an action by a nonresident, and for a cause not arising within the state, and therefore that the circuit court acquired no jurisdiction of this action brought against a British corporation by a citizen and resident of New Jersey. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 170 U. S. 106</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The constant tendency of judicial decisions in modern times has been in the direction of putting corporations upon the same footing as natural persons in regard to the jurisdiction of suits by or against them.</p>\n<p>By the Constitution of the United States, the judicial power, so far as depending upon citizenship of parties, was declared to extend to controversies "between citizens of different states," and to those between "citizens" of a state and foreign "citizens or subjects."  And Congress, by the Judiciary Act of 1789, in defining the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States, described each party to such a controversy either as "a citizen" of a state, or as "an alien."  Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 11, 1 Stat. 78; Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 629.  Yet the words "citizens" and "aliens" in these provisions of the Constitution and of the Judiciary Act have always been held by this Court to include corporations.</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the circuit courts over suits between a citizen of one state and a corporation of another state was at first maintained upon the theory that the persons composing the corporation were suing or being sued in its name, and upon the presumption of fact that all those persons were citizens of the state by which the corporation had been created, but that this presumption might be rebutted by plea and proof and the jurisdiction thereby defeated.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html">Bank of United States v.

Deveaux,</em> above cited, had been overruled, and while that case was still recognized as authority for the principle that in a question of jurisdiction, the court might look to the character of the persons composing a corporation, Chief Justice Taney, in delivering judgment, said that the principle had "never been supposed to extend to contracts made by a corporation, especially in another sovereignty," but that,</p>\n<p>"whenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity, of the artificial being created by the charter, and not the contract of the individual members."</p>\n<p>13 Pet.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html#586">38 U.

Earle,</em> it was adjudged that a corporation created by one state, and acting within the scope of its charter, might do business and make contracts in another state when permitted to do so by the laws thereof, and might sue upon such contracts in the courts of that state.  As was said in the opinion:</p>\n<p>"It is sufficient that its existence as an artificial person in the State of its creation is acknowledged and recognized by the law of the nation where the dealing takes place, and that it is permitted by the laws of that place to exercise there the powers with which it is endowed."</p>\n<p>13 Pet.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html#589">38 U. S. 589</a></span>.  And it was declared to be well settled that, by the law of comity among nations prevailing among the several states of the Union, "a corporation created by one sovereignty is permitted to make contracts in another, and to sue in its courts," except as to contracts repugnant to its own policy.  <em>Id.,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html#592">38 U. S. 592</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The manifest injustice which would ensue if a foreign corporation, permitted by a state to do business therein and to bring suits in its courts, could not be sued in those courts, and thus, while allowed the benefits, be exempt from the burdens, of the laws of the state has induced many states to provide by statute that a foreign corporation making contracts within the state shall appoint an agent residing therein, upon whom process may be served in actions upon such contracts.  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 170 U. S. 108</a></p><p> Court has often held that wherever such a statute exists, service upon an agent so appointed is sufficient to support jurisdiction of an action against the foreign corporation, either in the courts of the state or, when consistent with the acts of Congress, in the courts of the United States held within the state, but it has never held the existence of such a statute to be essential to the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/404/case.html">Lafayette Ins.

Mr. Justice Swayne, in delivering judgment, said:</p>\n<p>"If the theory maintained by the counsel for the plaintiff in error be correct, however large or small the cause of action, and whether it were a proper one for legal or equitable cognizance, there could be no legal redress short of the seat of the company in another state.  In many instances, the cost of the remedy would have largely exceeded the value of its fruits.  In suits local in their character, both at law and in equity, there could be no relief.  The result would be, to a large extent, immunity from all legal responsibility.  It is not be supposed that Congress intended that the important powers and privileges granted should be followed by such results.  But, turning our attention from this view of the subject and looking at the statute alone, and reading it by its own light, we entertain no doubt that it made the company liable to suit, where this suit was brought, in all respects as if it had been an independent corporation of the same locality."</p>\n<p><em>Id.,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/65/case.html#83">79 U.

The decision, in principle and in effect, recognizes that a corporation of one state, lawfully doing business in another state and summoned in an action in the latter state by service upon its principal officer therein, is subject to the jurisdiction of the court in which the action is brought.</p>\n<p>In England, the right of a foreign corporation doing business in England to sue in the English courts was long ago recognized, and its liability to be subjected to suit in those courts, by service made upon one of its principal officers residing and representing it within the realm, has been fully established by recent decisions.  <em>Newby v.

It has therefore been decided that a statute which requires all actions against a county to be brought in the county court does not prevent the circuit court of the United States from taking jurisdiction of such an action, Chief Justice Chase saying that "no statute limitation of suability can defeat a jurisdiction given by the Constitution."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/118/case.html">Cowles v.

The summons was duly served upon the regularly appointed agents of the corporation in New York.  <em>In re Hohorst,</em> above cited.  The action was within the general jurisdiction conferred by Congress upon the circuit courts of the United States.

To the President, treasurer or secretary, or, if the corporation lacks either of those officers, to the officer performing corresponding functions, under another name."</p>\n<p>"2. To a person designated for the purpose by a writing, under the seal of the corporation, and the signature of its President, vice-President, or other acting head, accompanied with the written consent of the person designated, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State.  The designation must specify a place within the state as the office or residence of the person designated, and if it is within a city, the street, and the street number, if any, or other suitable designation of the particular locality.  It remains in force until the filing in the same office of a written revocation thereof, or of the consent, executed in like manner, but the person designated may from time to time  change the place specified as his office or residence to some other place within the state by a writing, executed by him and filed in like manner.  The Secretary of State may require the execution of any instrument, specified in this section, to be authenticated as he deems proper, and he may refuse to file it without such an authentication.  An exemplified copy of a designation so filed, accompanied with a certificate that it has not been revoked, is presumptive evidence of the execution thereof, and conclusive evidence of the authority of the officer executing it."</p>\n<p>"3. If such a designation is not in force, or if neither the person designated, nor an officer specified in subdivision first of this section, can be found with due diligence, and the corporation has property within the state, or the cause of action arose therein, to the cashier, a director, or a managing agent of the corporation within the state."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 1780.  <em>When Foreign Corporations may be Sued.</em>  An action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by a resident of the state, or by a domestic corporation, for any cause of action.  An action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by another foreign corporation, or by a nonresident, in one of the following cases only:"</p>\n<p>"1. Where the action is brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract made within the state, or relating to property situated within the state at the time of the making thereof."</p>\n<p>"2. Where it is brought to recover real property situated within the state, or a chattel, which is replevied within the state."</p>\n<p>"3. Where the cause of action arose within the state, except where the object of the action is to affect the title to real property situated without the state."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
