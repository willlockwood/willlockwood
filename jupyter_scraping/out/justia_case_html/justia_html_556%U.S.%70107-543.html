In response to the ruling in <em>General Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Gilbert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/index.html">429 U. S. 125</a>, that such differential treatment of pregnancy leave was not sex-based discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress added the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to Title VII in 1978 to make it \xe2\x80\x9cclear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/index.html">462 U. S. 669</a>, 684.  On the PDA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, AT&amp;T replaced its old plan with the Anticipated Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit for pregnancy leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but did not make any retroactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel policies.  Each of the individual respondents therefore received less service credit for her pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would have for general disability leave, resulting in a reduction in her total employment term and, consequently, smaller AT&amp;T pensions.  They, along with their union, also a respondent, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges alleging discrimination based on sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.  The EEOC issued each respondent (collectively, Hulteen) a determination letter finding reasonable cause to believe AT&amp;T had discriminated and a right-to-sue letter.  Hulteen filed suit in the District Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit precedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that differentiated based on pregnancy.  The Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>An employer does not necessarily violate the PDA when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only pre-PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for medical leave generally.  Because AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s pension payments accord with a bona fide seniority system\xe2\x80\x99s terms, they are insulated from challenge under Title VII \xc2\xa7703(h).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s benefit calculation rule is protected by \xc2\xa7703(h), which provides: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation \xe2\x80\xa6 pursuant to a bona fide seniority \xe2\x80\xa6 system \xe2\x80\xa6 provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of \xe2\x80\xa6 sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U. S. 324</a>, 356, the Court held that a pre-Title VII seniority system that disproportionately advantaged white, as against minority, employees nevertheless exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory terms under \xc2\xa7703(h), where the discrimination resulted from the employer\xe2\x80\x99s hiring practices and job assignments.  Because AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s system must also be viewed as bona fide, <em>i.e.,</em> as a system having no discriminatory terms, \xc2\xa7703(h) controls the result here, just as it did in <em>Teamsters</em>.  This Court held in <em>Gilbert </em>that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, \xe2\x80\x9can exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  429 U. S., at 136.  The only way to conclude that \xc2\xa7703(h) does not protect AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s system would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s acts as having been illegal when done.  This is not a serious possibility.  Generally, there is \xe2\x80\x9ca presumption against retroactivity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a>, 272\xe2\x80\x93273.  There is no such clear intent here.  Section 706(e)(2)\xe2\x80\x94which details when \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94has no application because <em>Gilbert</em> unquestionably held that the feature of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system at issue here was not discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so.  Nor can it be argued that because AT&amp;T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so was facially discriminatory at that time.  If a choice to rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination, \xc2\xa7703(h) would never apply.  Finally, <em>Bazemore </em>v. <em>Friday</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html">478 U. S. 385</a>\xe2\x80\x94in which a pre-Title VII compensation plan giving black employees less pay than whites was held to violate Title VII on its effective date\xe2\x80\x94is inapplicable because the <em>Bazemore</em> plan did not involve a seniority system subject to \xc2\xa7703(h) and the employer there failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice when Title VII became law.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(k), when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only prior to the PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy leave than for medical leave generally.  We hold there is no necessary violation; and the benefit calculation rule in this case is part of a bona fide seniority system under \xc2\xa7703(h) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(h), which insulates it from challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 1914, AT&amp;T Corporation (then American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company) and its Bell System Operating Companies, including Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (hereinafter, collectively, AT&amp;T),[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] have provided pensions and other benefits based on a seniority system that relies upon an employee\xe2\x80\x99s term of employment, understood as the period of service at the company minus uncredited leave time.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, AT&amp;T employees on \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d leave got full service credit for the entire periods of absence, but those who took \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d leaves of absence received maximum service credit of 30 days.  Leave for pregnancy was treated as personal, not disability.  AT&amp;T altered this practice in 1977 by adopting its Maternity Payment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant employees to disability benefits and service credit for up to six weeks of leave.  If the absence went beyond six weeks, however, it was treated as personal leave, with no further benefits or credit, whereas employees out on disability unrelated to pregnancy continued to receive full service credit for the duration of absence.  This differential treatment of pregnancy leave, under both the pre-1977 plan and the MPP, was lawful: in <em>General Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Gilbert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/index.html"></a><a href="/us/429/125/index.html">429 U. S. 125</a> (1976), this Court concluded that a disability benefit plan excluding disabilities related to pregnancy was not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing the PDA, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e(k), which superseded <em>Gilbert</em> so as to make it \xe2\x80\x9cclear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/index.html">462 U. S. 669</a>, 684 (1983).  On April 29, 1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&amp;T adopted its Anticipated Disability Plan which replaced the MPP and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on the same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabilities.  AT&amp;T did not, however, make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit calculations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA personnel policies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four of those women are named respondents in this case. Each of them received less service credit for pregnancy leave than she would have accrued on the same leave for disability: seven months less for Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.  Respondents Hulteen, Collet, and Snyder have retired from AT&amp;T; respondent Porter has yet to.  If her total term of employment had not been decreased due to her pregnancy leave, each would be entitled to a greater pension benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eventually, each of the individual respondents and  respondent Communications Workers of America (CWA), the collective-bargaining representative for the majority of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s nonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.  In 1998, the EEOC issued a Letter of Determination finding reasonable cause to believe that AT&amp;T had discriminated against respondent Hulteen and \xe2\x80\x9ca class of other similarly-situated female employees whose adjusted [commencement of service] date has been used to determine eligibility for a service or disability pension, the amount of pension benefits, and eligibility for certain other benefits and programs, including early retirement offerings.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 54\xe2\x80\x9355.  The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to each named respondent and the CWA (collectively, Hulteen), and Hulteen filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On dueling motions for summary judgment, the District Court held itself bound by a prior Ninth Circuit decision, <em>Pallas</em> v. <em>Pacific Bell</em>, 940 F.\xc2\xa02d 1324 (1991), which found a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that differentiated on the basis of pregnancy.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a\xe2\x80\x93122a.  The Circuit, en banc, affirmed and held that <em>Pallas</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9ccalculation of service credit excluding time spent on pregnancy leave violates Title VII was, and is, correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 F.\xc2\xa03d 1001, 1003 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision directly conflicts with the holdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that reliance on a pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine pension benefits does not constitute a current violation of Title VII.  See <em>Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm</em>. v. <em>Communication Workers of Am.</em>, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no actionable Title VII violation given the existence of a bona fide seniority system); <em>Leffman</em> v. <em>Sprint Corp</em>., 481 F.\xc2\xa03d 428 (CA6 2007) (characterizing claim as challenging the continuing effects of past discrimination rather than alleging a current Title VII violation).  We granted certiorari in order to resolve this split, 554 U. S. __ (2008), and now reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title VII makes it an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 sex.\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  Generally, a claim under Title VII must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(1).  In this case, Hulteen has identified the challenged practice as applying the terms of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system to calculate and pay pension benefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April 29, 1979.  She says the claim is timely because the old service credit differential for pregnancy leave was carried forward through the system\xe2\x80\x99s calculations so as to produce an effect in the amount of the benefit when payments began.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that the payment of pension benefits in this case is a function of a seniority system, given the fact that calculating benefits under the pension plan depends in part on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s term of employment.  As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] \xe2\x80\x98seniority system\xe2\x80\x99 is a scheme that, alone or in tandem with non-\xe2\x80\x98seniority\xe2\x80\x99 criteria, allots to employees ever improving employment rights and benefits as their relative lengths of pertinent employment increase.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>California Brewers Assn.</em> v. <em>Bryant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/598/index.html">444 U. S. 598</a>, 605\xe2\x80\x93606 (1980) (footnote omitted).  Hulteen is also undoubtedly correct that AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s personnel policies affecting the calculation of any employee\xe2\x80\x99s start date should be considered \xe2\x80\x9cancillary rules\xe2\x80\x9d and elements of the system, necessary for it to operate at all, being rules that \xe2\x80\x9cdefine which passages of time will \xe2\x80\x98count\xe2\x80\x99 towards the accrual of seniority and which will not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 607.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But contrary to Hulteen\xe2\x80\x99s position, establishing the continuity of a seniority system whose results depend in part on obsolete rules entailing disadvantage to once-pregnant employees does not resolve this case.  Although adopting a service credit rule unfavorable to those out on pregnancy leave would violate Title VII today, a seniority system does not necessarily violate the statute when it gives current effect to such rules that operated before the PDA.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]eniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/63/index.html">432 U. S. 63</a>, 81 (1977), reflecting Congress\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that their stability is valuable in its own right.  Hence, \xc2\xa7703(h):</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority \xe2\x80\xa6 system \xe2\x80\xa6 provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

S. 324</a> (1977), advantages of a seniority system flowed disproportionately to white, as against minority, employees, because of an employer\xe2\x80\x99s prior discrimination in job assignments.  We recognized that this \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate distribution of advantages does in a very real sense operate to freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices[,] [b]ut both the literal terms of \xc2\xa7703(h) and the legislative history of Title VII demonstrate that Congress considered this very effect of many seniority systems and extended a measure of immunity to them.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 350 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he unmistakable purpose of \xc2\xa7703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 352.  The seniority system in <em>Teamsters </em>exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory terms (the discrimination having occurred in executive action hiring employees and assigning jobs), so that the Court could conclude that the system \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have its genesis in \xe2\x80\xa6 discrimination, and \xe2\x80\xa6 has been maintained free from any illegal purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s system must also be viewed as bona fide, that is, as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with the consequence that subsection (h) controls the result here, just as in <em>Teamsters</em>.  It is true that in this case the pre-April 29, 1979 rule of differential treatment was an element of the seniority system itself; but it did not taint the system under the terms of subsection (h), because this Court held in <em>Gilbert </em>that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, \xe2\x80\x9can exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  429 U. S., at 136.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Although the PDA would have made it discriminatory to continue the accrual policies of the old rule, AT&amp;T amended that rule as of the effective date of the Act, April 29, 1979; the new one, treating pregnancy and other temporary disabilities the same way, remains a part of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This account of litigation, legislation, and the evolution of the system\xe2\x80\x99s terms is the answer to Hulteen\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Teamsters </em>supports her position.  She correctly points out that a \xe2\x80\x9cseniority system that perpetuates the effects of pre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to discriminate entered into its very adoption,\xe2\x80\x9d 431 U. S., at 346, n. 28, and she would characterize AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system as intentionally discriminatory, on the theory that the accrual rule for pregnancy leave was facially discriminatory from the start.  She claims further support from <em>Automobile Workers </em>v. <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/187/index.html">499 U. S. 187</a> (1991), in which we said that \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit facial discrimination does not depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such facial discrimination is intentional discrimination even if not based on any underlying malevolence. <em> Id.</em>, at 199.  Hulteen accordingly claims that the superseded differential affecting current benefits was, and remains, \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But <em>Automobile Workers </em>is not on point.  The policy in that case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with lead exposure unless they could show themselves incapable of child bearing, was put in place after the PDA became law and under its terms was facially discriminatory.  In this case, however, AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s intent when it adopted the pregnancy leave rule (before the PDA) was to give differential treatment that as a matter of law, as <em>Gilbert </em>held, was not gender-based discrimination.  Because AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s differential accrual rule was therefore a permissible differentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing in the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h) bona fide requirement.  The consequence is that subsection (h) is as applicable here as it was in <em>Teamsters</em>, and the calculations of credited service that determine pensions are the results of a permissibly different standard under subsection (h) today.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only way to conclude here that the subsection would not support the application of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s system would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize the acts as having been illegal when done, contra <em>Gilbert</em>.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But this is not a serious possibility.  As we have said,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations.  Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U.

Brief for Respondents 27\xe2\x80\x9329.  Section 706(e)(2) provides that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter (whether or not that discriminatory purpose is apparent on the face of the seniority provision), when the seniority system is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to the seniority system, or when a person aggrieved is injured by the application of the seniority system or provision of the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut, as the text makes clear, this subsection determines the moments at which a seniority system violates Title VII only if it is a system \xe2\x80\x9cadopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  As discussed above, the Court has unquestionably held that the feature of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system at issue was not discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so in violation of this subchapter.  That leaves \xc2\xa7706(e)(2) without any application here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is equally unsound for Hulteen to argue that when she retired AT&amp;T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to do so facially discriminatory at that time.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  If a choice to rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination, subsection (h) would never apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hulteen\xe2\x80\x99s remaining argument (as of the time the case was submitted to us) is that our decision in <em>Bazemore </em>v. <em>Friday</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html">478 U. S. 385</a> (1986)<em> (per curiam)</em>, is on her side.  In <em>Bazemore</em>, black employees of the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, who received less pay than comparable whites under a differential compensation plan extending back to pre-Title VII segregation, brought suit in 1971 claiming that pay disparities persisted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 389\xe2\x80\x93391.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] pattern or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became a violation upon Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, and to the extent an employer continued to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bazemore</em> has nothing to say here.  To begin with, it did not involve a seniority system subject to subsection (h); rather, the employer in <em>Bazemore</em> had a racially based pay structure under which black employees were paid less than white employees.  Further, after Title VII became law, the employer failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice, even though the new statute had turned what once was legally permissible into something unlawful.  <em>Bazemore</em> would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&amp;T continued to apply an unfavorable credit differential for pregnancy leave simply because it had begun to do that before the PDA.  AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s system, by contrast, provides future benefits based on past, completed events, that were entirely lawful at the time they occurred.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have accepted supplemental briefing after the argument on the possible effect on this case of the recent amendment to \xc2\xa7706(e) of Title VII, adopted in response to <em>Ledbetter </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/618/index.html">550 U.

For the reasons already discussed, AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service credit for pregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with the consequence that Hulteen has not been \xe2\x80\x9caffected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73(A), 123 Stat. 6. </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bona fide seniority systems allow, among other\nthings, for predictable financial consequences, both for the employer who pays the bill and for the employee who gets the benefit.

As to those women, the Court reasons, the disadvantageous treatment remains as <em>Gilbert</em> declared it to be: \xe2\x80\x9cfacially nondiscriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d and without \xe2\x80\x9cany gender-based discriminatory effect,\xe2\x80\x9d 429 U.

On this reading, the Act calls for an immediate end to any pretense that classification on the basis of pregnancy can be \xe2\x80\x9cfacially nondiscriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  While the PDA does not reach back to redress discrimination women encountered before Congress overruled <em>Gilbert</em>, the Act instructs employers forthwith to cease and desist: From and after the PDA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, classifications treating pregnancy disadvantageously must be recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all employment-related purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d including pension payments, as discriminatory both on their face and in their impact.

Minority group members ranked low on the seniority list because, pre-Title VII, they were locked out of the job category in question.  But the seniority system itself, the Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have its genesis in \xe2\x80\xa6 discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d contained no discriminatory terms, and applied \xe2\x80\x9cequally to all races and ethnic groups,\xe2\x80\x9d 431 U.

Therefore, the Court concluded, \xc2\xa7703(h) sheltered the system despite its adverse impact on minority group members only recently hired for, or allowed to transfer into, more desirable jobs.  See<em> id</em>., at 356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case differs from <em>Teamsters</em> because AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s seniority system itself was infected by an overt differential.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ule of differential treatment was an element of the seniority system itself \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  One could scarcely maintain that AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s scheme was \xe2\x80\x9cneutral on [its] face and in intent,\xe2\x80\x9d discriminating against women only \xe2\x80\x9cin effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Teamsters</em>, 431 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (because of <em>Gilbert</em>, AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantageous treatment of pregnancy leave \xe2\x80\x9cdid not taint the system under the terms of [\xc2\xa7703(h)]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were the PDA an ordinary instance of legislative revision by Congress in response to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statutory text, I would not dissent from today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But Congress made plain its view that <em>Gilbert</em> was not simply wrong about the character of a classification that treats leave necessitated by pregnancy and childbirth disadvantageously.  In disregarding the opinions of other courts, see <em>supra</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa02, of the agency that superintends enforcement of Title VII, see <em>supra</em>, at 2,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and, most fundamentally, the root cause of discrimination against women in the paid labor force, this Court erred egregiously.  Congress did not provide a remedy for pregnancy-based discrimination already experienced before the PDA became effective.  I am persuaded by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and legislative history, however, that Congress intended no continuing reduction of women\xe2\x80\x99s compensation, pension benefits included, attributable to their placement on pregnancy leave.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few further considerations influence my dissenting view.  Seeking equal treatment only from and after the PDA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, plaintiffs present modest claims.  As the Court observes, they seek service credit, for pension benefit purposes, for the periods of their pregnancy leaves.  For the named plaintiffs, whose claims are typical, the uncounted leave days are these: \xe2\x80\x9cseven months \xe2\x80\xa6 for Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  See also 498 F.\xc2\xa03d 1001, 1004 (CA9 2007) (en banc) (case below).  Their demands can be met without disturbing settled expectations of other workers, the core concern underlying the shelter \xc2\xa7703(h) provides for seniority systems.  See <em>Franks</em> v. <em>Bowman Transp. Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/index.html">424 U. S. 747</a>, 766, 773, and n. 33 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98benefit\xe2\x80\x99 seniority,\xe2\x80\x9d unlike \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98competitive status\xe2\x80\x99 seniority,\xe2\x80\x9d does not conflict with economic interests of other employees).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, as Judge Rymer explained in her opinion dissenting from the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s initial panel opinion, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 665\xe2\x80\x93666 (2006), the relief plaintiffs request is not retroactive in character.  Plaintiffs request no backpay or other compensation for past injury.  They seek pension benefits, now and in the future, equal to the benefits received by others employed for the same length of time.  The actionable conduct of which they complain is AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s denial of equal benefits to plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cin the post-PDA world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 667.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does it appear that equal benefits for plaintiffs during their retirement years would expose AT&amp;T to an excessive or unmanageable cost.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 class is not large; it comprises only women whose pregnancy leaves predated April 29, 1979 and whose employment continued long enough for their pensions to vest.  The periods of service involved are short\xe2\x80\x94several weeks or some months, not years.  And the cost of equal treatment would be spread out over many years, as eligible women retire.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth, throughout human history, have sustained pervasive, often law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s place among paid workers and active citizens.
