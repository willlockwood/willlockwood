S. 137</a></p><p></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>On January 16, 1973, respondent filed a complaint in the District Court seeking to compel the petitioner, as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to allot among the States the full sums authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1973 and 1974 by \xc2\xa7 207 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as added by the Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 839, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1287 (1970 ed., Supp. II), for federal grants to municipalities for construction of publicly owned waste treatment works.  Although conceding in the trial court that the Administrator had a measure of discretion in making the allotments </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 420 U. S. 138</a></p><p> authorized by \xc2\xa7 205 of the Act, 86 Stat. 837, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1285 (1970 ed., Supp. III), respondent asserted that the Administrator had abused his discretion by allotting only 45% of the sums authorized to be appropriated by \xc2\xa7 207.  In sustaining respondent\'s position, the District Court rejected the holding by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <em>City of New York v. Ruckelshaus,</em> 358 F.Supp. 669 (1973), that the Administrator has no discretion to allot less than the full amounts authorized by the Act.  The Court of Appeals proceeded on the premise that there was discretion to control or delay allotments, but concluded that further proceedings were essential to determine whether the Administrator\'s discretion had been abused.  The Administrator petitioned for certiorari, asserting that the exercise of his discretion to allot funds under \xc2\xa7 205 is not subject to judicial review. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/136/case.html">*</a></span>  We granted certiorari, 416 U.S. 969 (1974), and heard the case with <em>Train v. City of New York, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/35/case.html">420 U. S. 35</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We held in <em>Train v. City of New York</em> that the Administrator has no authority under \xc2\xa7 205 to allot less than the full amounts sought to be appropriated under \xc2\xa7 207.  Because that holding is at odds with the premise underlying the judgment of the Court of Appeals, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and with the opinion in <em>Train v. City of New York.</em></p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs in the result.</p>\n<p>* The petition also asserted that the doctrine of sovereign immunity foreclosed ordering the Administrator to allot funds that he had withheld in the course of exercising his discretion under the Act.  In light of <em>Train v. City of New York, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/35/case.html">420 U. S. 35</a></span>, and our disposition of the instant case, we need not address this question.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
