And on the 16th of August, 1861, the President did issue his proclamation, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] declaring Louisiana, with other states, in a state of insurrection against the United States and forbidding all commercial intercourse with the inhabitants of such states.</p>\n<p>On the 26th of February, 1862 (after this act and proclamation), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 87 U.

The court decided against him as to the acceptance made on the 23d of April, and in his favor as to the others.  He then took the case into the Court of Appeals, and there, upon the acceptance of the 23d of April, for $8,050, raised the same question as before, and no other, contending that the proclamations of blockade of the 15th and 19th of April, by the President, had the effect to dissolve the partnership, and that by reason of them the Act of acceptance was void as to him.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in its opinion discussed the question at what stage of the civil war the rule against commercial intercourse with the enemy took effect so as to dissolve the contract of partnership.

As to the other acceptances, it admitted that they had been rightly disposed of in the court below.
