UNITED STATES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">JOHNSON <em>v</em>. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x936925.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 6, 2009\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 2, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  The Government sought sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an enhanced penalty for a person who violates \xc2\xa7922(g) and who \xe2\x80\x9chas three previous convictions\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ca violent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(1), defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>an offense that \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Among the three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(b), but was a felony conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of another battery, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(2).  Under Florida law, a battery occurs when a person\xc2\xa0either \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against [his] will,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a).  Nothing in the record permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 conviction rested upon the \xe2\x80\x9cstrik[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily harm\xe2\x80\x9d elements of the offense.  Accordingly, his conviction was a predicate conviction for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only if \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another constitutes the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Concluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s sentence under \xc2\xa7924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Florida felony offense of battery by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another person does not have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in <em>State</em> v. <em>Hearns</em>, 961 So.\xc2\xa02d 211, 218,<em> </em>that, under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s statutory equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7775.084, the offense of battery does not \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve the use . . . of physical force or violence against any individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7776.08.  The meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not state law.  The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, including the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding<em> </em>that \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a)\xe2\x80\x99s element of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touching\xe2\x80\x9d another person is satisfied by <em>any </em>intentional physical contact, no matter how slight.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning.  <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a>, 144\xe2\x80\x93145.  The adjective \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d is clear.  The noun \xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d however, has a number of meanings.  Its ordinary meaning refers to the application of strength, power, and violence\xe2\x80\x94in this context, against another person.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Government suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is a legal term of art describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery.  At common law, that element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.  Although a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit.  Here \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is used in defining not the crime of battery, but rather the statutory category of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>violent</em> felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  In that context, \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means <em>violent</em> force\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  Cf. <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11.  Moreover, it is significant that the meaning the Government seeks to impute to the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d derives from the elements of a common-law misdemeanor.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define the contours of a misdemeanor.  Nor can any negative inference about the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d required by \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn from \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0There is no force to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that this decision will undermine its ability to enforce \xc2\xa7922(g)(9)\xe2\x80\x99s firearm disability against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence that has as an element the \xe2\x80\x9cuse . . .  of physical force,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  The Court interprets the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d only in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses.  Similarly misplaced is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that it will now be more difficult to obtain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under generic felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an alien convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(E).  See, <em>e.g., Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___; <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 26.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reliance upon the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause\xe2\x80\x9d of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for consideration whether Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under that provision.

Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  The Government sought an enhanced penalty under \xc2\xa7924(e), which provides that a person who violates \xc2\xa7922(g) and who \xe2\x80\x9chas three previous convictions\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ca violent felony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted on occasions different from one another\xe2\x80\x9d shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life.  A \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s indictment specified five prior felony convictions.  The Government contended that three of those convictions\xe2\x80\x94for aggravated battery and for burglary of a dwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003\xe2\x80\x94rendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  At the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that the two 1986 convictions were for \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d but he objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction.  That conviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant who (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even simple battery) before, \xc2\xa7784.03(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person either \xe2\x80\x9c1.\xc2\xa0[a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c2.\xc2\xa0[i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Hearns</em>, 961 So.\xc2\xa02d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007).  It can prove that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily harm,\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally str[uck]\xe2\x80\x9d the victim, or that he merely \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the victim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since nothing in the record of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 battery conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it rested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 26 (2005) (plurality opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only if \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another person constitutes the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  The District Court concluded that it does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under \xc2\xa7924(e)(1) to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  528 F.\xc2\xa03d 1318 (2008).  We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences upon \xe2\x80\x9cviolent career criminal[s],\xe2\x80\x9d Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7775.084(4)(d) (2007), defined to mean persons who have three convictions for certain felonies, including any \xe2\x80\x9cforcible felony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7775.084(1)(d)(1)(a).  \xe2\x80\x9c[F]orcible felony\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to include a list of enumerated felonies\xe2\x80\x94including murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated assault, and aggravated battery\xe2\x80\x94and also \xe2\x80\x9cany other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7776.08.  In <em>Hearns</em>, the Florida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of battery on a law enforcement officer, \xc2\xa7784.07(2)(b)\xe2\x80\x94which requires the same conduct (directed against a law enforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a)\xe2\x80\x94was not a forcible felony.  See 961 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 219.  It said that since \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only the slightest unwanted physical touch, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use .\xc2\xa0. . of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d was not an element of the offense.  <em>Id.,</em> at 219.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted physical touching constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in <em>Hearns</em> that it does not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not so.  The meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not state law.  And in answering that question we are not bound by a state court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a similar\xe2\x80\x94or even identical\xe2\x80\x94state statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements of Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(2).  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Fankell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/911/index.html">520 U. S. 911</a>, 916 (1997).  The Florida Supreme Court has held that the element of \xe2\x80\x9cactually and intentionally touching\xe2\x80\x9d under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s battery law is satisfied by <em>any </em>intentional physical contact, \xe2\x80\x9cno matter how slight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hearns</em>, 961 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 218.  The most \xe2\x80\x9cnominal contact,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a \xe2\x80\x9cta[p] . . . on the shoulder without consent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 219, establishes a violation.  We apply \xe2\x80\x9cth[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/307/index.html">443 U.

S. 137</a>, 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (1995).  The adjective \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d is clear in meaning but not of much help to our inquiry.  It plainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies\xe2\x80\x94distinguishing physical force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.  It is the noun that poses the difficulty; \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d has a number of meanings.  For present purposes we can exclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a cause of the acceleration of mass.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second).  In more general usage it means \xe2\x80\x9c[s]trength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower to affect strongly in physical relations,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 985.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s) defines \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it defines \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  All of these definitions suggest a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the word \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d: its use in describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.  See 2\xc2\xa0W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa77.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003); accord, Black\xe2\x80\x99s 173.  The common law held this element of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S.\xc2\xa0E. 427, 428 (1921); see also 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa77.15(a).  The question is whether the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in the common-law definition of battery.  The Government asserts that it does.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Turley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/407/index.html">352 U. S. 407</a>, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit.  Ultimately, context determines meaning, <em>Jarecki</em> v. <em>G.\xc2\xa0D. Searle &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/303/index.html">367 U. S. 303</a>, 307 (1961), and we \xe2\x80\x9cdo not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/243/index.html">546 U. S. 243</a>, 282 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Here we are interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d as used in defining not the crime of battery, but rather the statutory category of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).  In <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a> (2004), we interpreted the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.  That provision is very similar to \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense which \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use . . . of physical force against the person or property of another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa716(a).  We stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn construing both parts of \xc2\xa716, we cannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98crime of violence.\xe2\x80\x99  The ordinary meaning of this term, combined with \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just so here.  We think it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>violent</em> felony,\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means <em>violent</em> force\xe2\x80\x94that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  See <em>Flores</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 350 F.\xc2\xa03d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easterbrook, J.).  Even by itself, the word \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 2846 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement . . .\xe2\x80\x9d); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1706 (\xe2\x80\x9c[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force\xe2\x80\x9d).  When the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d is attached to the noun \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1188 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, 960 F.\xc2\xa02d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term to be defined, \xe2\x80\x98violent felony,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence\xe2\x80\x9d).        </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d the Government would seek to import into this definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is a meaning derived from a common-law <em>misdemeanor.</em>  At common law, battery\xe2\x80\x94<em>all </em>battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching\xe2\x80\x94was a misdemeanor, not a felony.  See 4 Blackstone 216\xe2\x80\x93218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa72.1(b), at 90; ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980).  As the dissent points out, <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion of Alito, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and felonies has shifted over time.  But even today a simple battery\xe2\x80\x94whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury variety\xe2\x80\x94generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa716.1(b) (2d ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009\xe2\x80\x932010); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(b); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \xc2\xa75/12\xe2\x80\x933(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa722.01(b) (West Supp. 2008).  It is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.  Of course \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d <em>can </em>be given its common-law misdemeanor meaning by artful language, but here the only text that can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d itself.  Since, as we have seen, that is as readily (indeed, much more readily) taken to describe <em>violent </em>force, there is no reason to define \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to a nonviolent misdemeanor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that we cannot construe 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as an element the use of <em>violent</em> force, because there is no modifier in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d required.  As we have discussed, however, the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor is there any merit to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention, <em>post</em>, at 4, that the term \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to require violent force, because Congress specifically named \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can be committed without violence.  The point would have force (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, however, they are listed in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as examples of felonies that \xe2\x80\x9cpresen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government has not argued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies under this latter provision.  What the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument comes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of physical force and qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(i).  That obviously does not follow.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also asks us to draw a negative inference from the presence of the \xe2\x80\x9cbodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d specification added to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the \xe2\x80\x9cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The absence of such language in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government contends, proves that the merest touch suffices.  Even as a matter of logic that does not follow.  Specifying that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d must rise to the level of bodily injury does not suggest that without the qualification \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d would consist of the merest touch.  It might consist, for example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict pain\xe2\x80\x94a slap in the face, for example.  Moreover, this is not a case where Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[d] particular language in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in another section of <em>the same Act</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into law in 1994\xe2\x80\x94eight years after enactment of the language in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Compare Pub. L. 103\xe2\x80\x93322, \xc2\xa7110401, 108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99\xe2\x80\x93570, \xc2\xa71402, 100 Stat. 3207\xe2\x80\x9339 (1986).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its ability to enforce the firearm disability in \xc2\xa7922(g)(9) for persons who previously have been convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is defined to include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, \xe2\x80\x9cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(ii).  The prediction is unfounded.  We have interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d only in the context of a statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  We do not decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the context of defining a <em>misdemeanor</em> crime of domestic violence.  The issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our interpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pursuant to 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  That phrase is defined to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716])\xe2\x80\x9d committed by certain persons, including spouses, former spouses, and parents.  \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(E)(i).  The Government contends it will be harder to obtain removal based upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida, do not require the use of violent physical force.  The dissent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identified, <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, and n.\xc2\xa03, as having generic felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact, our decision will render convictions under those statutes \xe2\x80\x9coutside the scope of [the Armed Career Criminal Act],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.  When the law under which the defendant has been convicted contains statutory phrases that cover several different generic crimes, some of which require violent force and some of which do not, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98modified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that we have approved, <em>Nijhawan</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record\xe2\x80\x94including charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms.  See <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4); <em>Shepard</em>, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 602 (1990).  Indeed, the Government has in the past obtained convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act in precisely this manner.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Simms</em>, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 313, 316\xe2\x80\x93317 (CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Robledo-Leyva</em>, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida battery), cert. denied, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Luque-Barahona</em>, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524\xe2\x80\x93525 (CA7 2008) (same).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete.  But absence of records will often frustrate application of the modified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x94not just to battery but to many other crimes as well.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Shepard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (burglary).  It is implausible that avoiding that common-enough consequence with respect to the single crime of battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh Circuit for its consideration of whether Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 battery conviction is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  We decline to do so.  The Government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause.  App. 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Moreover, the parties briefed the \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) issue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned that if Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(2) satisfied \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), then it was a predicate \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e)(1); but \xe2\x80\x9cif not, then not.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, set aside Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent notes, <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, that, around the time the Armed Career Criminal Act became law, in \xe2\x80\x9cquite a few States\xe2\x80\x9d it was a felony offense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims, such as police officers.  That would be relevant for determining whether a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d conviction.  But it has no bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses\xe2\x80\x94making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of individuals\xe2\x80\x94involves the use of \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even further afield is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, that since \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not.

S. C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).  The classic definition of the crime of battery is the \xe2\x80\x9cintentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 5 (citing 2\xc2\xa0W.

Thus, the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls squarely within the plain language of ACCA.  Because I believe that ACCA was meant to incorporate this traditional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court starts out in the right direction by noting that the critical statutory language\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x94may mean either (a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The Court veers off course, however, by concluding that the statutory language reaches only violent force.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cforce,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court correctly notes, had a well-established meaning at common law that included even the \xe2\x80\x9cslightest offensive touching.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 5.

Blackstone, Commentaries<em> </em>on the Laws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).  This approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent touching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient to inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap in the face).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Congress selects statutory language with a well-known common-law meaning, we generally presume that Congress intended to adopt that meaning.

And here, I see nothing to suggest that Congress meant the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cuse of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d in ACCA to depart from that phrase\xe2\x80\x99s meaning at common law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory interpretation point to the same conclusion.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x94the clause immediately following the clause at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as including any crime that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents <em>a serious potential risk of physical injury to another</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Because Congress did not include a similar limitation in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should presume that it did not intend for such a limitation to apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language used by Congress in \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) further illustrates this point.  This provision criminalizes, among other things, the possession of a firearm by a person who is subject to a court order that \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate partner or child <em>that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Although \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until eight years after \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), see <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 9, the former provision is nevertheless instructive.  If Congress had wanted to include in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to those in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \xc2\xa7922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress could have easily done so expressly.  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the common-law  understanding, but neither is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first argues that \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d force because that provision defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But it is apparent that ACCA uses \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as a term of art with a wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary usage.  ACCA specifically provides that burglary and extortion are \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felon[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we have held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted burglary, <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a> (2007).  All of these offenses may be committed without violent force,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is not a requirement under ACCA.  Instead, ACCA classifies crimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies because they often lead to violence.  As we have put it, these crimes create \xe2\x80\x9csignificant risks of \xe2\x80\xa6 confrontation that might result in bodily injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 199, and offensive touching creates just such a risk.  For example, when one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely consequence.   See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Velazquez-Overa</em>, 100 F.\xc2\xa03d 418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf burglary, with its tendency to cause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is considered a violent crime under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(b), then surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that occurs when a child is sexually molested\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood</em>, 52 F.\xc2\xa03d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only other reason for rejecting the common-law definition is the fact that battery at common law was a misdemeanor.  The Court reasons that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining \xe2\x80\x98violent felony\xe2\x80\x99 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216\xe2\x80\x93218 (1769), and ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)).  The Court does not spell out why Congress\xe2\x80\x99 selection of this term would be unlikely, but I assume that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s point is that Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a violent felony an offense that was regarded at common law as a mere misdemeanor.  This argument overlooks the significance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the subsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limitation imposed by 18 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At common law, the terms \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d did not have the same meaning as they do today.  At that time, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, 480, n. 7 (2000); most felonies were punishable by death, see <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a>, 13 (1985); and many very serious crimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to murder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Watson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/index.html">423 U. S. 411</a>, 439\xe2\x80\x93440 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Since that time, however, the term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d has come to mean any offense punishable by a lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one year, see <em>Burgess</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/124/index.html">553 U. S. 124</a>, 130 (2008)); the term \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d has been reserved for minor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors at common law have been reclassified as felonies.  And when the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a few States had felony battery statutes that retained the common-law definition of \xe2\x80\x9cforce.\xe2\x80\x9d See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police officer a felony); Idaho Code \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x93915(c) (Lexis 1987) (same); Ill. Crim.

There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely about this approach.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation will have untoward consequences.  Almost half of the States have statutes that reach both the use of violent force and force that is not violent but is unlawful and offensive.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Many of the States classify these batteries as felonies or make them punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Although the great majority of convictions under these statutes are, no doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be to take all these convictions outside the scope of ACCA\xe2\x80\x94unless the Government is able to produce documents that may properly be consulted under the modified categorical approach and that conclusively show that the offender\xe2\x80\x99s conduct involved the use of violent force, see<em> ante,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  As the Government notes, however, this will often be impossible because, in those States in which the same battery provision governs both the use of violent force and offensive touching, charging documents frequently simply track the language of the statute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to draw distinctions based on the type of force that the defendant employed.  See<em> </em>Brief for United States 42\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d may hobble at least two federal statutes that contain this identical term.  Under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and the term \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as applying only to crimes that \xe2\x80\x9cha[ve], as an element, the use or attempted use of <em>physical force</em>, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A) (emphasis added).  As we recently explained, Congress recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98many people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and Congress therefore enacted this provision to keep firearms out of the hands of such abusers.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hayes</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).  Cases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted under generally applicable assault and battery statutes, <em>ibid</em>., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of almost half the States apply both to cases involving the use of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.  As a result, if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d in ACCA is applied to \xc2\xa7922(g)(9), a great many persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse will be allowed to possess firearms.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to removal, and the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as an offense that, among other things, has \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use [or] attempted use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a).  Accordingly, if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is applied to this provision, many convicted spousal and child abusers will escape removal, a result that Congress is unlikely to have intended.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, I believe that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is incorrect, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U.
