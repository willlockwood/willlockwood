L. 86-392, 74 Stat. 8 (1960 Act), the "former Fort Apache Military Reservation" is "held by the United States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe, subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements." The Secretary has exercised that right with respect to about 30 of the post\'s buildings and appurtenances. The Tribe sued the United States for the amount necessary to rehabilitate the property occupied by the Government in accordance with standards for historic preservation, alleging that the United States had breached a fiduciary duty to maintain, protect, repair, and preserve the trust property. In its motion to dismiss, the Government acknowledged that, under the Indian Tucker Act, it was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims with respect to certain Indian tribal claims, but stressed that the waiver operated only when underlying substantive law could fairly be interpreted as giving rise to a particular duty, breach of which should be compensable in money damages. The Government contended that jurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation could fairly be read to impose a legal obligation on it to maintain or restore the trust property, let alone authorize compensation for breach. The Court of Federal Claims agreed and dismissed the complaint, relying primarily on <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mitchell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/535/case.html">445 U.

The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded, on the understanding that the Government\'s property use under the 1960 Act triggered a common-law trustee\'s duty to act reasonably to preserve any property the Secretary chose to utilize, an obligation fairly interpreted as supporting a money damages claim.

Pp. 473-474.</p><p>(c) The 1960 Act goes beyond a bare trust and permits a fair inference that the Government is subject to duties as a trustee and potentially liable in damages for breach. The statute expressly defines a fiduciary relationship in the provision that Fort Apache be held by the Government in trust for the Tribe, then proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. It is undisputed that the Government has to this day availed</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="467">467</a></p><p>itself of its option. As to the property subject to the Government\'s actual use, then, the United States has not merely exercised daily supervision but has enjoyed daily occupation, and so has obtained control at least as plenary as its authority over the timber in <i>Mitchell II. </i>Although the 1960 Act, unlike the statutes cited in that case, does not expressly subject the Government to management and conservation duties, the fact that the property occupied by the United States is expressly subject to a trust supports a fair inference that an obligation to preserve the property improvements was incumbent on the Government as trustee. See, <i>e. g., Central States, Southeast </i>&amp; <i>Southwest Areas Pension Fund </i>v. <i>Central Transport, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/559/case.html">472 U. S. 559</a>, 572. Thus, the Government should be liable in damages for breach. <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 226. Pp. 474-476.</p><p>(d) The Court rejects the Government\'s three defenses. First, the argument that the 1960 Act specifically carved out of the trust the Government\'s right to use the property it occupied is at odds with a natural reading of the 1960 Act, which provided that "Fort Apache" was subject to the trust, not that the trust consisted of only the property not used by the Secretary. Second, the argument that there is nothing in the 1960 Act from which an intent to provide a damages remedy is fairly inferable rests on a failure to appreciate either the role of trust law in drawing a fair inference or the scope of <i>United States </i>v. <i>Testan, 424 </i>U. S. 392, and <i>Army and Air Force Exchange Service </i>v. <i>Sheehan, 456 </i>U. S. 728, on which the Government relies. The Government\'s assertion that an explicit provision for money damages is necessary to support every Tucker Act claim would leave <i>Mitchell II </i>wrongly decided, for there is no federal statute explicitly providing that inadequate timber management would be compensated through a suit for damages. More fundamentally, the Government\'s position, if carried to its conclusion, would read the trust relation out of Indian Tucker Act analysis; if a specific provision for damages is needed, a trust obligation and trust law are not. <i>Sheehan </i>and <i>Testan </i>are not to the contrary; they were cases without any trust relationship in the mix of relevant fact, but with affirmative reasons to believe that no damages remedy could have been intended, absent a specific provision. Third, the Government is clearly wrong when it argues that prospective injunctive relief tailored to the situation, rather than the inference of a damages remedy, is the only appropriate remedy for maintenance failures. If the Government is suggesting that the recompense for run-down buildings should be an affirmative order to repair them, it is merely proposing the economic (but perhaps cumbersome) equivalent of damages. But if it is suggesting that relief must be limited to an injunction to toe the fiduciary mark in the future, it would bar the courts from making the Tribe whole for</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="468">468</a></p><p>468 UNITED STATES <i>v. </i>WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE</p><p>deterioration already suffered, and shield the Government against the remedy whose very availability would deter it from wasting trust property in the period before a Tribe has gone to court for injunctive relief. <i>E. g., Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 227.

In 1922, Congress transferred control of the fort to the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and, in 1923, set aside about 400 acres, out of some 7,000, for use as the Theodore Roosevelt Indian School.

Pub. L. 86-392, 74 Stat. 8 (1960 Act). The Secretary exercised that right, and although the record does not catalog the uses made by the Department of the Interior, they extended to about 30 of the post\'s buildings and appurtenances, a few of which had been built when the Government first occupied the land. Although the National Park Service listed the fort as a national historical site in 1976, the recognition was no augury of fortune, for just over 20 years later the World Monuments Watch placed the fort on its 1998 List of 100 Most Endangered Monuments. Brief for Respondent 3.</p><p>In 1993, the Tribe commissioned an engineering assessment of the property, resulting in a finding that as of 1998 it would cost about $14 million to rehabilitate the property occupied by the Government in accordance with standards for historic preservation.

S. 535</a> (1980) <i>(Mitchell I), </i>and <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mitchell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/206/case.html">463 U. S. 206</a> (1983) <i>(Mitchell II).

The general trust provision established no duty of the United States to manage timber resources, tribal members, rather, being "responsible for using the land," "occupy[ing] the land," and "manag[ing] the land." 445 U.

The Court of Appeals held that the provision for the Government\'s exclusive control over the building actually occupied raised the trust to the level of <i>Mitchell II, </i>in which the trust relationship together with Government\'s control over the property triggered a specific responsibility.</p><p>Chief Judge Mayer dissented on the understanding that the 1960 Act "carve[d] out" from the trust the portions of the property that the Government is entitled to use for its own benefit, with the consequence that the Tribe held only a contingent future interest in the property, insufficient to support even a common law action for permissive waste. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/249/1364/">249 F.3d 1364</a>, 1384 (2001).</p><p>We granted certiorari to decide whether the 1960 Act gives rise to jurisdiction over suits for money damages against the United States, 535 U.

The terms of consent to be sued may not be inferred, but must be "unequivocally expressed," <i>Mitchell I, supra, </i>at 538 (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>King, 395 </i>U.

S. 584</a>, 586 (1941)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tucker Act contains such a waiver, <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 212, giving the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to award damages upon proof of "any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress," 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1491(a)(1), and its companion statute, the Indian Tucker Act, confers a like waiver for Indian tribal claims that "otherwise would be cognizable in the Court of Federal Claims if the claimant were not an Indian tribe," \xc2\xa7 1505.</p><p>Neither Act, however, creates a substantive right enforceable against the Government by a claim for money damages. <i>Mitchell I, supra, </i>at 538-540; <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 216.

The characterizations of the trust as "limited," <i>Mitchell I, </i>445 U. S., at 542, or "bare," <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 224, distinguish the Allotment Act\'s trust-inname from one with hallmarks of a more conventional fiduciary relationship. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Navajo Nation, post, </i>at 504 (discussing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Allotment Act in <i>Mitchell I </i>as having "removed a standard element of a trust relationship"). Although in form the United States "h[e]ld the land ... in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian," 25 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 348, the statute gave the United States no functional obligations to manage timber; on the contrary, it established that "the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land," that "the allottee would occupy the land," and that "the allottee, and not the United States, was to manage the land." <i>Mitchell I, </i>445 U. S., at 542-543. Thus, we found that Congress did not intend to "impose any duty" on the Government to manage resources, <i>id., </i>at 542; cf. <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 217-218, and we made sense of the trust language, considered without reference to any statute beyond the Allotment Act, as intended "to prevent alienation of the land" and to guarantee that the Indian allottees were "immune from state taxation," <i>Mitchell I, supra, </i>at 544.</p><p>The subsequent case of <i>Mitchell II </i>arose on a claim that did look beyond the Allotment Act, and we found that stat-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="474">474</a></p><p>474 UNITED STATES <i>v. </i>WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE</p><p>utes and regulations specifically addressing the management of timber on allotted lands raised the fair implication that the substantive obligations imposed on the United States by those statutes and regulations were enforceable by damages. The Department of the Interior possessed "comprehensive control over the harvesting of Indian timber" and "exercise[d] literally daily supervision over [its] harvesting and management," <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 209, 222 (quoting <i>White Mountain Apache Tribe </i>v. <i>Bracker, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html">448 U.

As the statutes and regulations gave the United States "full responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the benefit of the Indians," we held that they "define[d] ... contours of the United States\' fiduciary responsibilities" beyond the "bare" or minimal level, and thus could "fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation" through money damages if the Government faltered in its responsibility. 463 U.

We have recognized a general trust relationship since 1831. <i>Cherokee Nation </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i>5 Pet. 1, 16 (1831) (characterizing the relationship between Indian tribes and the United States as "a ward to his guardian"); <i>Mitchell II, supra, </i>at 225 (discussing "the undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="475">475</a></p><p>States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe." 74 Stat. 8. Unlike the Allotment Act, however, the statute proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. The trust property is "subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements for administrative or school purposes for as long as they are needed for the purpose," <i>ibid., </i>and it is undisputed that the Government has to this day availed itself of its option. As to the property subject to the Government\'s actual use, then, the United States has not merely exercised daily supervision but has enjoyed daily occupation, and so has obtained control at least as plenary as its authority over the timber in <i>Mitchell II. </i>While it is true that the 1960 Act does not, like the statutes cited in that case, expressly subject the Government to duties of management and conservation, the fact that the property occupied by the United States is expressly subject to a trust supports a fair inference that an obligation to preserve the property improvements was incumbent on the United States as trustee. This is so because elementary trust law, after all, confirms the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary actually administering trust property may not allow it to fall into ruin on his watch.

It asserts that in the 1960 Act Congress specifically "carve[d] out of the trust" the right of the Federal Government to use the property for the Government\'s own purposes. Brief for United States 24-25 (emphasis deleted). According to the United States, this carve-out means that the 1960 Act created even less than the "bare trust" in <i>Mitchell </i>1. But this position is at odds with a natural reading of the 1960 Act. It provided that "Fort Apache" was subject to the trust; it did not read that the trust consisted of only the property not used by the Secretary. Nor is there any apparent reason to strain to avoid the straightforward reading; it makes sense to treat even the property used by the Government as trust property, since any use the Secretary would make of it would presumably be intended to redound to the benefit of the Tribe in some way.</p><p>Next, the Government contends that no intent to provide a damages remedy is fairly inferable, for the reason that "[t]here is not a word in the 1960 Act-the only substantive</p><p>4 The proper measure of damages is not before us.

See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7 244 (1957) ("The trustee is entitled to indemnity out of the trust estate for expenses properly incurred by him in the administration of the trust"). Nor do we reach the issue whether a rent-free occupant is obligated to supply funds to maintain the property it benefits from. See Restatement of Property \xc2\xa7 187, Comment b (1936) ("When the right of the owner of the future interest is that the owner of the estate for life shall do a given act, as for example, ... make repairs ... then this right is made effective through compelling by judicial action the specific doing of the act").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="477">477</a></p><p>source of law on which the Tribe relies-that suggests the existence of such a mandate." Brief for United States 28. The argument rests, however, on a failure to appreciate either the role of trust law in drawing a fair inference or the scope of <i>United States </i>v. <i>Testan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/392/case.html">424 U. S. 392</a> (1976), and <i>Army and Air Force Exchange Service </i>v. <i>Sheehan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/728/case.html">456 U. S. 728</a> (1982), cited in support of the Government\'s position.</p><p>To the extent that the Government would demand an explicit provision for money damages to support every claim that might be brought under the Tucker Act, it would substitute a plain and explicit statement standard for the less demanding requirement of fair inference that the law was meant to provide a damages remedy for breach of a duty. To begin with, this would leave <i>Mitchell II </i>a wrongly decided case, for one would look in vain for a statute explicitly providing that inadequate timber management would be compensated through a suit for damages. But the more fundamental objection to the Government\'s position is that, if carried to its conclusion, it would read the trust relation out of Indian Tucker Act analysis; if a specific provision for damages is needed, a trust obligation and trust law are not. And this likewise would ignore <i>Mitchell </i><i>I, </i>where the trust relationship was considered when inferring that the trust obligation was enforceable by damages. To be sure, the fact of the trust alone in <i>Mitchell I </i>did not imply a remedy in damages or even the duty claimed, since the Allotment Act failed to place the United States in a position to discharge the management responsibility asserted. To find a specific duty, a further source of law was needed to provide focus for the trust relationship. But once that focus was provided, general trust law was considered in drawing the inference that Congress intended damages to remedy a breach of obligation.</p><p><i>Sheehan </i>and <i>Testan </i>are not to the contrary; they were cases without any trust relationship in the mix of relevant fact, but with affirmative reasons to believe that no damages</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="478">478</a></p><p>478 UNITED STATES <i>v. </i>WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE</p><p>remedy could have been intended, absent a specific provision. In <i>Sheehan, </i>specific authorization was critical because of a statute that generally granted employees the damages remedy petitioner sought, but "expressly denie[d] that cause of action" to Army and Air Force Exchange Service personnel, such as petitioner. 456 U. S., at 740. In <i>Sheehan, </i>resting in part on <i>Testan, </i>the Tucker Act plaintiffs unsuccessfully asserted that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over a claim against the United States for money damages for allegedly improper job classifications under the Classification Act. We stressed that no provision in the statute "expressly makes the United States liable," <i>Testan, </i>424 U. S., at 399, and rather, that there was a longstanding presumption against petitioner\'s argument. "The established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been duly appointed to it .... The Classification Act does not purport by its terms to change that rule, and we see no suggestion in it or in its legislative history that Congress intended to alter it." <i>Id., </i>at 402. Thus, in both <i>Sheehan </i>and <i>Testan </i>we required an explicit authorization of a damages remedy because of strong indications that Congress did not intend to mandate money damages. Together they show that a fair inference will require an express provision, when the legal current is otherwise against the existence of a cognizable claim. But that was not the case in <i>Mitchell II </i>and is not the case here.</p><p>Finally, the Government argues that the inference of a damages remedy is unsound simply because damages are inappropriate as a remedy for failures of maintenance, prospective injunctive relief being the sole relief tailored to the situation. Reply Brief for United States 19. We think this is clearly wrong.

Thus, as the Court here observes, the Act expressly and without qualification employs a term of art ("trust") commonly understood to entail certain fiduciary obligations, see <i>ante, </i>at 474-476, and "invest[s] the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus," <i>ante, </i>at 475; cf. <i>Navajo, post, </i>at 508 ("no provision of the [Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA)] or its regulations contains <i>any </i>trust language with respect to coal leasing"). Further, as the Court describes, the Tribe tenably maintains that the Government has "availed itself of its option" to "exercis[e] daily supervision ... [and] enjo[y] daily occupation" of the trust corpus, <i>ante, </i>at 475, but has done so in a manner irreconcilable with its caretaker obligations.

In my view, this is more than sufficient to distinguish this case from <i>Mitchell II.</i></p><p>Moreover, even assuming that <i>Mitchell II </i>can be read to support the proposition that mere factual control over property is sufficient to create compensable trust duties (which it cannot), the Court has never provided any guidance on the nature and scope of such duties. And, in any event, the Court has never before held that "control" alone can give rise to, as the majority puts it, the specific duty to "preserve the property." <i>Ante, </i>at 475. Indeed, had Congress wished to create such a duty, it could have done so expressly in the 1960 Act. Its failure to follow that course strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to create a compensable trust relationship between the United States and the Tribe.</p><p>In addition, the Court\'s focus on control has now rendered the inquiry open-ended, with questions of jurisdiction determined by murky principles of the common law of trusts,2 and</p><p>2 Even assuming the common law of trusts is relevant to determining whether a claim of money damages exists against the United States, it is well established that a trustee is not ultimately liable for the costs of upkeep and maintenance of the trust property. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7 244 (1957) ("The trustee is entitled to indemnity out of the trust estate for expenses properly incurred by him in the administration of the trust"); 3A A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts \xc2\xa7 244, p. 325 (4th ed. 1988) ("[The trustee] is entitled to indemnity for liabilities properly incurred for the payment of taxes, for repairs, for improvements ... "). Besides making the bald assertion that money damages "naturally follo[w]" from the existence of a trust duty, <i>ante, </i>at 476 (internal quotation</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="487">487</a></p><p>a parcel-by-parcel determination whether "portions of the property were under United States control," 249 F. 3d, at 1383. Such an approach provides little certainty to guide Congress in fashioning legislation that insulates the United States from damages for breach of trust. Instead, to the ultimate detriment of the Tribe, Congress might refrain from creating trust relationships out of apprehension that the use of the word "trust" will subject the United States to liability for money damages.</p><p>***</p><p>The Court today fashions a new test to determine whether Congress has conferred a substantive right enforceable against the United States in a suit for money damages. In doing so, the Court radically alters the relevant inquiry from one focused on the actual fiduciary duties created by statute or regulation to one divining fiduciary duties out of the use of the word "trust" and notions of factual control. See <i>ante, </i>at 474-475. Because I find no basis for this approach in our case law or in the language of the Indian Tucker Act, I respectfully dissent.</p><p>marks omitted), the Court makes no attempt to explain how a damages remedy lies against the United States when the same remedy would not be available against a private trustee.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
