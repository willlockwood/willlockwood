The complaint alleged:</p>\n<p>"That on November 23, 1891, and for nearly six months prior thereto, this plaintiff was in the employ of said defendant, as a workman in the mine of said defendant, in breaking and preparing rock for the chutes, and doing other work, as ordered by the foreman of said defendant, one Samuel Finley, under whom this plaintiff worked, and from whom he received his orders; that, on November 23, 1891, while this plaintiff was yet in the employ of said defendant, he was ordered by the foreman of said defendant company to break rock immediately above and over one of the chutes of the defendant company; that, in compliance with the orders of the foreman of said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 168 U.

The defendant introduced evidence, which was uncontradicted, that its business was under the control of a general manager, and was divided into three departments -- the mine, the mill, and the chlorination works -- each of which departments had a foreman or superintendent under the general manager; that the mine department had three shifts or gangs of workmen -- two by day and one at night -- and that Finley was boss of the one at night. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 168 U.

JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The evidence introduced at the trial, giving it the utmost possible effect in favor of the plaintiff, was insufficient to support </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 168 U. S. 89</a></p><p> a verdict for him, and the defendant\'s request, made at the close of the whole evidence, to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant because Finley, whose negligence was the ground of the action, was a fellow servant of the plaintiff should have been granted.</p>\n<p>Finley was not a vice-principal or representative of the corporation.  He was not the general manager of its business, or the superintendent of any department of that business.  But he was merely the foreman or boss of the particular gang of men to which the plaintiff belonged.  Whether he had or had not authority to engage and discharge the men under him is immaterial.  Even if he had such authority, he was nonetheless a fellow servant with them, employed in the same department of business and under a common head.  There was no evidence that he was an unsuitable person for his place, or that the machinery was imperfect or defective for its purpose.  The negligence, if any, was his own negligence in using the machinery or in giving orders to the men.</p>\n<p>The case is governed by a series of recent decisions of this Court, undistinguishable in their facts from this one:  <em>Central Railroad v. Keegan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/160/259/case.html">160 U. S. 259</a></span>; <em>Northern Pacific Railroad v.

Railroad,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/166/399/case.html">166 U. S. 399</a></span>.  <em>See also Wilson v. Merry,</em> L.R. 1 H.L.Sc. 326.</p>\n<p>This ground being decisive of the case, no opinion need be expressed upon other questions argued at the bar.</p>\n<p><em>Judgments of the circuit court of appeals and of the district court reversed, and case remanded to the district court, with directions to set aside the verdict, and to order a new trial.</em></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissented.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
