S. 460</a></p><p></p>\n<p>WASHINGTON, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in this case as follows:</p>\n<p>This case differs in no material respect from that of the <em>Joseph,</em> just decided, except that in this a question arises as to the validity of the capture.  The master of the <em>Grotius,</em> in answer to the second standing interrogatory, swears that he hath never considered the ship to have been taken or seized as prize.  That he was present when an armed schooner under English colors met with her, the commander of which represented her </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 12 U. S. 461</a></p><p> to be a British privateer called the <em>Bream,</em> and requested him to take on board a man and treat him as a gentleman until he arrived in the United States, to which he consented.  This testimony of the captain is confirmed by Gilman, the mate, in answer to the 2d and 3d interrogatories, who adds that Very, the man who was put on board, never conducted as prize master, nor in any other manner than a passenger would, during the voyage.  Pierce, one of the seamen who accompanied the captain on board the schooner, swears that he never knew the ship was seized as prize until after her arrival within the Boston Lighthouse.  Chambers, another seaman belonging to the <em>Grotius,</em> in answer to the third interrogatory, says that she was met by an armed schooner under English colors which obliged the mate of the ship to go on board her, and afterwards sent him back with a man who, on the next day, declared himself to be put on board as prize master, saying that if she should fall in with a French vessel, he should be obliged to show his commission.  That he knows not upon what pretense or for what reason she was taken, not knowing, in fact, that she was made prize of until her arrival at Boston.</p>\n<p>Daniel J. Very, the alleged prize master, has deposed on oath that he was present at the capture of the <em>Grotius</em> by the <em>Frolic;</em> that the captain of the ship was ordered on board the schooner with his papers; and that he, Very, was directed by his commander to go on board as prize master, and this in the presence of the captain of the <em>Grotius;</em> that the master of the ship was to keep possession of the papers and to navigate her into port.  That he accordingly went on board as prize master, carrying with him a copy of the commission of the <em>Frolic</em> and instructions in writing from the commander to him (Very) as prize master.  That the captain of the <em>Grotius</em> informed his crew that in case a British cruiser should board the <em>Grotius,</em> and they should be asked respecting the said Very, they were to answer that he was a passenger.</p>\n<p>Without giving any opinion as to the regularity of admitting the affidavit of the prize master as a part of the preparatory evidence, the Court is of opinion that the facts necessary for deciding upon the validity of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 12 U. S. 462</a></p><p> capture are not sufficiently clear, and that it will be proper to make an order for further proof, to be furnished by the captors and the claimants, with respect to all the circumstances of the capture.</p>\n<p>This point appears not to have been made or considered in the court below.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
