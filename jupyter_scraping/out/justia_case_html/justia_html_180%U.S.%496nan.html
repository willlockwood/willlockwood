S. 498</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of this Court in ordinary actions in the District of Columbia is limited to cases in which the amount in controversy is over $5,000.  27 Stat. 434, 436, c. 74, \xc2\xa7 8.  The fact, as disclosed by the declaration, is that plaintiff paid less than $90 to preserve from sale property worth only $1,800.  Everything which the defendants did was done by virtue of an order or judgment of a court of this district having full jurisdiction.  Whether such judgment was simply irregular or absolutely void, plaintiff cancelled all her liabilities by the payment of a sum less than $90, and the only property of hers endangered by their action she avers was worth $1,800.  It is true that, in the declaration, she charges illegality and spite, but such language is mere matter of epithet.  We are guided by the facts as they are stated.  There was no personal violence, no insult; nothing which sometimes rightfully opens the door to punitive damages.  Finding that property of the value of $1,800 was, as she thought, endangered, she paid $90 to escape the danger.  Obviously her assertion that she was damaged to the amount of $6,000 was without legal foundation, and only made with the purpose of securing a review in this Court.  Nothing in the facts justified any such assertion.  Jurisdiction cannot be vested in this Court by a mere claim of damages, unsupported by facts.  We do not care to enter into any discussion of this question, but refer simply to <em>Bowman v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/611/case.html">115 U. S. 611</a></span>, and cases cited in the opinion.</p>\n<p>The writ of error will be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
