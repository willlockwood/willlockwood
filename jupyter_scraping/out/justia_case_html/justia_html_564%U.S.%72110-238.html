Candidates who opt to participate, and who accept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign.  They are also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s initial state allotment.  Once matching funds are triggered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x94including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate spends on his campaign\xe2\x80\x94and for every dollar spent by independent groups that support the privately financed candidate.  When there are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Matching funds top out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Arizona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching funds provision, arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their First Amendment rights.  The District Court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the matching funds provision.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a minimal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s interest in reducing <em>quid pro quo</em> political corruption.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to survive First Amendment scrutiny.

S. 724</a>.  That law\xe2\x80\x94which permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap\xe2\x80\x94unconstitutionally forced a candidate \xe2\x80\x9cto choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 739.  This \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented penalty\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech\xe2\x80\x9d that was not justified by a compelling government interest.  <em>Id.</em>, at 739\xe2\x80\x93740.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The logic of <em>Davis </em>largely controls here.  Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the State\xe2\x80\x99s initial grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the privately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.  The privately financed candidate must \xe2\x80\x9cshoulder a special and potentially significant burden\xe2\x80\x9d when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy.  554 U. S., at 739.  If the law at issue in <em>Davis</em> imposed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably does so as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The differences between the matching funds provision and the law struck down in <em>Davis </em>make the Arizona law <em>more</em> constitutionally problematic, not less.  First, the penalty in <em>Davis</em> consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to raise the additional funds.  Here, the direct and automatic release of public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier burden.  Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly financed candidates\xe2\x80\x94a frequent occurrence in Arizona\xe2\x80\x94the matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.  Each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of funding to each of that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s publicly financed opponents.  Third, unlike the law in <em>Davis</em>, all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  Spending by independent expenditure groups to promote a privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s election triggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome or helpful.  Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he sees fit.  That disparity in control\xe2\x80\x94giving money directly to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expenditures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x94is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.  The more money spent on behalf of a privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the State.  The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes, and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.  In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed on privately financed candidates.  Independent groups, of course, are not eligible for public financing.  As a result, those groups can only avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak altogether.  Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice\xe2\x80\x94trigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speak\xe2\x80\x94makes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups and certainly contravenes \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/557/index.html">515 U. S. 557</a>, 573.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and <em>amicus </em>United States attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersuasive.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law invalidated in <em>Davis, </em>but there is no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater here than in <em>Davis.  </em>Arizona argues that the provision actually creates more speech.  But even if that were the case, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by the state law.  And burdening the speech of some\xe2\x80\x94here privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups\xe2\x80\x94to increase the speech of others is a concept \xe2\x80\x9cwholly foreign to the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 48\xe2\x80\x9349; cf. <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/index.html">418 U. S. 241</a>, 244, 258.  That no candidate or group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political rival.  And precedents upholding government subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were granted in response to the speech of another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in <em>Citizens United</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 558 U. S. ___.  A political candidate\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Indeed every court to have considered the question after <em>Davis </em>has concluded that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.  Arizona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be impermissible.  But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides that is constitutionally problematic.  It is the manner in which that funding is provided\xe2\x80\x94in direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds provision is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified by a compelling state interest,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 740.  Pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of the matching funds provision is to \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of candidate resources.  The clearest evidence is that the provision operates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the initial public funding allotment.  The text of the Arizona Act confirms this purpose.  The provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled \xe2\x80\x9cEqual funding of candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing funds,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(C)(4).  This Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in \xe2\x80\x9cleveling the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d that can justify undue burdens on political speech, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Citizens United</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___, and the burdens imposed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an interest.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruption\xe2\x80\x94and not \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.  Burdening a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the State\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption interest.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9creliance on personal funds <em>reduces</em> the threat of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 740\xe2\x80\x93741; see <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 53.  The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be supported by the anticorruption interest.  Such expenditures are \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical speech \xe2\x80\xa6 not coordinated with a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Citizens United</em>, 558 U. S., at ___.  That separation negates the possibility that the expenditures will result in the sort of <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption with which this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law is concerned.  See <em>e.g., id.,</em> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by \xe2\x80\xa6 contribution limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 55.  Given Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits, some of the most austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorruption interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the State\xe2\x80\x99s public funding system, which in turn helps combat corruption.  But the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption interest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.  The matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even greater extent than the law invalidated in <em>Davis</em>.  Those burdens cannot be justified by a desire to \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field,\xe2\x80\x9d and much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a danger of corruption.  The fact that the State may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its public funding system to achieve its desired level of participation\xe2\x80\x94without an undue drain on public resources\xe2\x80\x94is not a sufficient justification for the burden.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaw in the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.  By the State\xe2\x80\x99s logic it could award publicly financed candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.  Such measures might well promote such participation, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.  How the State chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State may burden political speech\xe2\x80\x94to the extent the matching funds provision does\xe2\x80\x94to ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy is not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s business.  But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is.  The government \xe2\x80\x9cmay engage in public financing of election campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d and doing so can further \xe2\x80\x9csignificant governmental interest[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92\xe2\x80\x9393, 96.  But the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.  It does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State.  This goes too far; Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.

Once a set spending limit is exceeded, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar spent by an opposing privately financed candidate.  The publicly financed candidate also receives roughly one dollar for every dollar spent by independent expenditure groups to support the privately financed candidate, or to oppose the publicly financed candidate.  We hold that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds scheme substantially burdens protected political speech without serving a compelling state interest and therefore violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, passed by initiative in 1998, created a voluntary public financing system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candidates for state office.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93940 <em>et seq</em>. (West 2006 and Supp. 2010).  All eligible candidates for Governor, secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, the corporation commission, mine inspector, and the state legislature (both the House and Senate) may opt \nto receive public funding.  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93950(D) (West Supp. 2010).  Eligibility is contingent on the collection of a specified number of five-dollar contributions from Arizona voters, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93946(B) (West 2006), 16\xe2\x80\x93950 (West Supp. 2010),[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and the acceptance of certain campaign restrictions and obligations.  Publicly funded candidates must agree, among other things, to limit their expenditure of personal funds to $500, \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93941(A)(2) (West Supp. 2010); participate in at least one public debate, \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93956(A)(2); adhere to an overall expenditure cap, \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93941(A); and return all unspent public moneys to the State, \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93953.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In exchange for accepting these conditions, participating candidates are granted public funds to conduct their campaigns.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In many cases, this initial allotment may be the whole of the State\xe2\x80\x99s financial backing of a publicly funded candidate.  But when certain conditions are met, publicly funded candidates are granted additional \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing\xe2\x80\x9d or matching funds.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(A), (B), and  (C)(4)\xe2\x80\x93(5) (providing for \xe2\x80\x9c[e]qual funding of candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Matching funds are available in both primary and general elections.  In a primary, matching funds are triggered when a privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the primary election allotment of state funds to the publicly financed candidate.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(A), (C).  During the general election, matching funds are triggered when the amount of money \na privately financed candidate receives in contributions, combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the general election allotment of state funds to the publicly fi-nanced candidate.  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(B).  A privately financed can-didate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures of his personal funds are counted \nas contributions for purposes of calculating matching funds during a general election.  See <em>ibid.</em>; Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Ariz. Admin. Rule R2\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93113(B)(1)(f) (Sept. 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once matching funds are triggered, each additional dol-lar that a privately financed candidate spends during \nthe primary results in one dollar in additional state funding to his publicly financed opponent (less a 6% reduction meant to account for fundraising expenses).  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(A).  During a general election, every dollar that a candidate receives in contributions\xe2\x80\x94which includes any money of his own that a candidate spends on his campaign\xe2\x80\x94results in roughly one dollar in additional state funding to his publicly financed opponent.  In an election where a privately funded candidate faces multiple publicly financed candidates, one dollar raised or spent by the privately fi-nanced candidate results in an almost one dollar increase in public funding to each of the publicly financed candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once the public financing cap is exceeded, additional expenditures by independent groups can result in dollar-for-dollar matching funds as well.  Spending by independent groups on behalf of a privately funded candidate, or \nin opposition to a publicly funded candidate, results in matching funds.  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(C).  Independent expenditures made in support of a publicly financed candidate can result in matching funds for other publicly financed candidates in a race.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The matching funds provision is not activated, however, when independent expenditures are made in opposition to a privately financed candidate.  Matching funds top out at two times the initial authorized grant of public funding to the publicly financed candidate.  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(E).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under Arizona law, a privately financed candidate may raise and spend unlimited funds, subject to state-imposed contribution limits and disclosure requirements.

Arizona is divided into 30 districts for purposes of electing members to the State\xe2\x80\x99s House of Representatives.  Each district elects two representatives to the House biannually.  In the last general election, the number of candidates competing for the two available seats in each district ranged from two to seven.  See State of Arizona Official Canvass, 2010 General Election Report (compiled and issued by the Arizona secretary of state).  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth District had three candidates for its two available House seats.  Two of those candidates opted to accept public funding; one candidate chose to operate his campaign with private funds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In that election, if the total funds contributed to the privately funded candidate, added to that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds and the expenditures of supportive independent groups, exceeded $21,479\xe2\x80\x94the allocation of public funds for the general election in a contested State House race\xe2\x80\x94the matching funds provision would be triggered.  See Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Participating Candidate Guide 2010 Election Cycle 30 (Aug. 10, 2010).  At that point, a number of differ-\nent political activities could result in the distribution of matching funds.

S. 724</a> (2008).  In <em>Davis</em>, we considered a First Amendment challenge to the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cMillionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d of the Biparti-\nsan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441a\xe2\x80\x931(a).  Under that Amendment, if a candidate for the United\xc2\xa0States House of Representatives spent more than $350,000 of his personal funds, \xe2\x80\x9ca new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme [came] into play.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at 729.  The opponent of the candidate who exceeded that limit was permitted to collect individual contributions up to $6,900 per contributor\xe2\x80\x94three times the normal contribution limit of $2,300.  See <em>ibid</em>.  The candidate who spent more than the personal funds limit remained subject to the original contribution cap.  Davis argued that this scheme \xe2\x80\x9cburden[ed] his exercise of his First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because\xe2\x80\x9d doing so had \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteract[ed] and thus diminishe[d] the effectiveness of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 own speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 736.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addressing the constitutionality of the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment, we acknowledged that the provision did not impose an outright cap on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s personal expenditures.  <em>Id.,</em> at 738\xe2\x80\x93739.  We nonetheless concluded that \nthe Amendment was unconstitutional because it forced a candidate \xe2\x80\x9cto choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 739.  Any candidate who chose to spend more than $350,000 of his own money was forced to \xe2\x80\x9cshoulder a special and potentially significant burden\xe2\x80\x9d because that choice gave fundraising advantages to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s adversary.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We determined that this constituted an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented penalty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that the Government had failed to advance any compelling interest that would justify such a burden.  <em>Id.</em>, at 739\xe2\x80\x93740.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The logic of <em>Davis </em>largely controls our approach to this case.  Much like the burden placed on speech in <em>Davis</em>, the matching funds provision \xe2\x80\x9cimposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises [his] First Amendment right[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 739.  Under that provision, \xe2\x80\x9cthe vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech\xe2\x80\x9d leads to \xe2\x80\x9cadvantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the State\xe2\x80\x99s initial grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar spent by the privately financed candidate results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.  That plainly forces the privately financed candidate to \xe2\x80\x9cshoulder a special and potentially significant burden\xe2\x80\x9d when choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his candidacy.  Ibid</em>.  If the law at issue in <em>Davis</em> imposed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably does so as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The penalty imposed by Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds provision is different in some respects from the penalty imposed by the law we struck down in <em>Davis</em>.  But those differences make the Arizona law <em>more</em> constitutionally problematic, not less.  See <em>Green Party of Conn.</em> v. <em>Garfield</em>, 616 F.\xc2\xa03d 213, 244\xe2\x80\x93245 (CA2 2010).  First, the penalty in <em>Davis</em> consisted of raising the contribution limits for one of the candidates.  The candidate who benefited from the increased limits still had to go out and raise the funds.  He may or may not have been able to do so.  The other candidate, therefore, faced merely the possibility that his opponent would be able to raise additional funds, through contribution limits that remained subject to a cap.  And still the Court held that this was an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial and potentially significant burden\xe2\x80\x9d that had to be justified by a compelling state interest\xe2\x80\x94a rigorous First Amendment hurdle.  554 U. S., at 739\xe2\x80\x93740.  Here the benefit to the publicly financed candidate is the direct and automatic release of public money.  That is a far heavier burden than in <em>Davis</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, depending on the specifics of the election at issue, the matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.  In the Arizona Fourth District House election pre-viously discussed, see <em>supra,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x936, if the spending cap were exceeded, each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate would result in an additional dollar of campaign funding to each of that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s publicly financed opponents.  In such a situation, the matching funds provi-\nsion forces privately funded candidates to fight a political hydra of sorts.  Each dollar they spend generates two adversarial dollars in response.  Again, a markedly more significant burden than in <em>Davis</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, unlike the law at issue in <em>Davis</em>, all of this is \nto some extent out of the privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  Even if that candidate opted to spend less than the initial public financing cap, any spending by independent expenditure groups to promote the privately financed candidate\xe2\x80\x99s election\xe2\x80\x94regardless whether such support was welcome or helpful\xe2\x80\x94could trigger matching funds.  What is more, that state money would go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he saw fit.  That \ndisparity in control\xe2\x80\x94giving money directly to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expenditures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x94is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.  That candidate can allocate the money according to his own campaign strategy, which the privately financed candidate could not do with the independent group expenditures that triggered the matching funds.  Cf. <em>Citizens United</em>,<em> </em>558 U. S.,<em> </em>at ___ (slip op., at 41) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent \xe2\x80\xa6 undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 47)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burdens that this regime places on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.  Just as with the candidate the independent group supports, the more money spent on that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s behalf or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the State.  And just as with the privately financed candidate, the effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes.  Moreover, spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates the group disapproves of, dollars directly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some ways, the burden the Arizona law imposes on independent expenditure groups is worse than the burden it imposes on privately financed candidates, and thus substantially worse than the burden we found constitutionally impermissible in <em>Davis</em>.  If a candidate contemplating an electoral run in Arizona surveys the campaign landscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the matching funds regime make a privately funded campaign unattractive, he at least has the option of taking public financing.  Independent expenditure groups, of course, do not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once the spending cap is reached, an independent expenditure group that wants to support a particular candidate\xe2\x80\x94because of that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s stand on an issue of con-cern to the group\xe2\x80\x94can only avoid triggering matching funds in one of two ways.  The group can either opt to change its message from one addressing the merits of the candidates to one addressing the merits of an issue, or refrain from speaking altogether.  Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice makes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups.  And forcing that choice\xe2\x80\x94trigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speak\xe2\x80\x94certainly contravenes \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/557/index.html">515 U.

The State correctly points out that our decision in <em>Davis</em> focused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment.  See 554 U. S., at 729.  But that is not because\xe2\x80\x94as the State asserts\xe2\x80\x94the reach of that opinion is limited to asymmetrical contribution limits.  Brief for State Respondents 26\xe2\x80\x9332.  It is because that was the particular burden on candidate speech we faced in <em>Davis</em>.  And whatever the significance of the distinction in general, there can be no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater in this case than in <em>Davis</em>: That means that the law here\xe2\x80\x94like the one in <em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x94must be justified by a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State argues that the matching funds provision actually results in more speech by \xe2\x80\x9cincreas[ing] debate about issues of public concern\xe2\x80\x9d in Arizona elections and \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[ing] the free and open debate that the First Amendment was intended to foster.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 41; see Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Institute 55.  In the State\xe2\x80\x99s view, this promotion of First Amendment ideals offsets any burden the law might impose on some speakers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not so.  Any increase in speech resulting from the Arizona law is of one kind and one kind only\xe2\x80\x94that of publicly financed candidates.  The burden imposed on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups reduces their speech; \xe2\x80\x9crestriction[s] on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S.<em>,</em> at 19.  Thus, even if the matching funds provision did result in more speech by publicly financed candidates and more speech in general, it would do so at the expense of impermissibly burdening (and thus reducing) the speech of privately financed \ncandidates and independent expenditure groups.

We have explained that while the statute in that case \xe2\x80\x9cpurported to advance free discussion, \xe2\x80\xa6 its effect was to deter newspapers from speaking out in the first instance\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cpenalized the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s own expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

Such a penalty, we concluded, could not survive First Amendment scrutiny.  The Arizona law imposes a similar penalty: The State grants funds to publicly financed candidates as a direct result of the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  The argument that this sort of burden promotes free and robust discussion is no more persuasive here than it was in <em>Tornillo</em>.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona asserts that no \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate or independent ex-penditure group is \xe2\x80\x98obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees with.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 32 (quoting <em>Johanns</em> v. <em>Livestock Marketing Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/550/index.html">544 U. S. 550</a>, 557 (2005)).  True enough.  But that does not mean that the matching funds provision does \nnot burden speech.  The direct result of the speech of pri-vately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political rival.  That cash subsidy, conferred in response to political speech, penalizes speech to a greater extent and more directly than the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment in <em>Davis</em>.  The fact that this may result in more speech by the other candidates is no more adequate a justification here than it was in <em>Davis</em>.  See 554 U. S., at 741\xe2\x80\x93742.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In disagreeing with our conclusion, the dissent relies \non cases in which we have upheld government subsidies against First Amendment challenge, and asserts that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have never, not once, understood a viewpoint-neutral subsidy given to one speaker to constitute a First Amendment burden on another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 16.  But none of those cases\xe2\x80\x94not one\xe2\x80\x94involved a subsidy given in direct response to the political speech of another, to allow the recipient to counter that speech.  And nothing in the analysis we employed in those cases suggests that the challenged subsidies would have survived First Amendment scrutiny if they were triggered by someone else\xe2\x80\x99s political speech.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State also argues, and the Court of Appeals concluded, that any burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups is more analogous to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and \ndisclaimer requirements we recently upheld in <em>Citizens United</em> than to direct restrictions on candidate and independent expenditures<em>.</em>  See 611 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 525; Brief for State Respondents 21, 35; Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Institute 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  This analogy is not even close.  A political candidate\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State and the Clean Elections Institute assert that the candidates and independent expenditure groups have failed to \xe2\x80\x9ccite specific instances in which they decided not to raise or spend funds,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for State Respondents 11; see <em>id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312, and have \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to present any reliable evidence that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s triggered matching funds deter their speech,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Institute 6; see <em>id.</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  The record in this case, which we must review in its entirety, does not support those assertions.  See <em>Bose Corp.</em> v. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/485/index.html">466 U. S. 485</a>, 499 (1984).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That record contains examples of specific candidates curtailing fundraising efforts, and actively discouraging supportive independent expenditures, to avoid triggering matching funds.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 567 (Rick Murphy), 578 (Dean Martin); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x93239, at 329 (John McComish), 300 (Tony Bouie).  The record also includes examples of independent expenditure groups deciding not to speak in opposition to a candidate, App. 569 (Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee), or in support of a candidate, <em>id.</em>, at 290 (Club for Growth), to avoid triggering matching funds.  In addition, Dr. David Primo, an expert involved in the case, \xe2\x80\x9cfound that privately financed candidates facing the prospect of triggering matching funds changed the timing of their fundraising activities, the timing of their expenditures, and, thus, their overall campaign strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner Arizona Free Enterprise Club\xe2\x80\x99s (AFEC) Freedom Club PAC et al. 12; see also <em>id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9317 (listing additional sources of evidence detailing the burdens imposed by the matching funds provision); Brief for Petitioner AFEC\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom Club PAC et\xc2\xa0al. 14\xe2\x80\x9321 (AFEC Brief) (same); Brief for Petitioner McComish et\xc2\xa0al. 30\xe2\x80\x9337 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State contends that if the matching funds provision truly burdened the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups, spending on behalf of privately financed candidates would cluster just below the triggering level, but no such phenomenon has been observed.  Brief for State Respondents 39; Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Institute 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  That should come as no surprise.  The hypothesis presupposes a privately funded candidate who would spend his own money just up to the matching funds threshold, when he could have simply taken matching funds in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Arizona law takes into account all manner of uncoordinated political activity in awarding matching funds.  If a privately funded candidate wanted \nto hover just below the triggering level, he would have to make guesses about how much he will receive in the form of contributions and supportive independent expenditures.  He might well guess wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, some candidates may be willing to bear the burden of spending above the cap.  That a candidate is willing to do so does not make the law any less burdensome.  See <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 739 (that candidates may choose to make \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal expenditures to support their campaigns\xe2\x80\x9d despite the burdens imposed by the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment does not change the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthey must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the State made privately funded candidates pay a $500 fine to run as such, the fact that candidates might choose to pay it does not make the fine any less burdensome.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While there is evidence to support the contention of \nthe candidates and independent expenditure groups that the matching funds provision burdens their speech, \xe2\x80\x9cit is never easy to prove a negative\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here, that candidates and groups did not speak or limited their speech because of the Arizona law.  <em>Elkins</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/206/index.html">364 U. S. 206</a>, 218 (1960).  In any event, the burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  Cf. <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 738\xe2\x80\x93740.  Indeed even candidates who sign up for public funding recognize the burden matching funds impose on private speech, stating that they participate in the program because \xe2\x80\x9cmatching funds \xe2\x80\xa6 discourage[\xc2\xa0] opponents, special interest groups, and lobbyists from campaigning against\xe2\x80\x9d them.  GAO, Campaign Finance Reform: Experiences of Two States that Offered Full Public Funding for Political Candidates 27 (GAO\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x93390, 2010).  As in <em>Davis</em>, we do not need empirical evidence to determine that the law at issue is burdensome.  See<em> </em>554 U. S., at 738\xe2\x80\x93740<em> </em>(requiring no evidence of a burden whatsoever).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear not only to us but to every other court to have considered the question after <em>Davis </em>that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Green Party of Conn</em>., 616 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 242 (matching funds impose \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial burden on the exercise of First Amendment rights\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>McComish</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, 611 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 524 (matching funds create \xe2\x80\x9cpotential chilling effects\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimpose some First Amendment burden\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, 612 F.\xc2\xa03d 1279, 1290 (CA11 2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cwe think it is obvious that the [matching funds] subsidy imposes a burden on [privately financed] candidates\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 1291 (\xe2\x80\x9cwe know of no court that doubts that a [matching funds] subsidy like the one at issue here burdens\xe2\x80\x9d the speech of privately financed candidates); see also <em>Day</em> v. <em>Holahan</em>, 34 F.\xc2\xa03d 1356, 1360 (CA8 1994) (it is \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d that matching funds provisions infringe on \xe2\x80\x9cprotected speech because of the chilling effect\xe2\x80\x9d they have \xe2\x80\x9con the political speech of the person or group making the [triggering] expenditure\xe2\x80\x9d (cited in <em>Davis</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 739)).  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement is little more than disagreement with <em>Davis</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State correctly asserts that the candidates and independent expenditure groups \xe2\x80\x9cdo not \xe2\x80\xa6 claim that a single lump sum payment to publicly funded candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent to the maximum amount of state financing that a candidate can obtain through matching funds, would impermissibly burden their speech.  Brief for State Respondents 56; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.  The State reasons that if providing all the money up front would not burden speech, providing it piecemeal does not do so either.  And the State further argues that such incremental administration is necessary to ensure that public funding is not under- or over-distributed.  See Brief for State Respondents 56\xe2\x80\x9357.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These arguments miss the point.  It is not the amount of funding that the State provides to publicly financed candidates that is constitutionally problematic in this case.  It is the manner in which that funding is provided\xe2\x80\x94in direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.  And the fact that the State\xe2\x80\x99s matching mechanism may be more efficient than other alternatives\xe2\x80\x94that it may help the State in \xe2\x80\x9cfinding the sweet-spot\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfine-tuning\xe2\x80\x9d its financing system to avoid a drain on public resources, <em>post</em>, at 26 (Kagan, J., dissenting)\xe2\x80\x94is of no moment; \xe2\x80\x9cthe First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N.\xc2\xa0C., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html">487 U.

Brief for United States 27.  Of course it does.  One does not have to subscribe to the view that electoral debate is zero sum, see AFEC Brief 30, to see the flaws in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 perspective.  All else being equal, an advertisement supporting the election of a candidate that goes without a response is often more effective than an advertisement that is directly controverted.  And even if the publicly funded candidate decides to use his new money to address a different issue altogether, the end goal of that spending is to claim electoral victory over the opponent that triggered the additional state funding.

The clearest evidence is of course the very operation of the provision: It ensures that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the initial public funding allotment.  The text of the Citizens Clean Elections Act itself confirms this purpose.  The sta-tutory provision setting up the matching funds regime \nis titled \xe2\x80\x9cEqual funding of candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952 (West Supp. 2010).  The Act refers to the funds doled out after the Act\xe2\x80\x99s matching mechanism is triggered as \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952(C)(4), (5).  And the regulations implementing the matching funds provision refer to those funds as \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing funds\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  See Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Ariz. Admin. Rule R2\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x80\x93113.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other features of the Arizona law reinforce this understanding of the matching funds provision.  If the Citizens Clean Election Commission cannot provide publicly financed candidates with the moneys that the matching funds provision envisions because of a shortage of funds, the statute allows a publicly financed candidate to \xe2\x80\x9caccept private contributions to bring the total monies received by the candidate\xe2\x80\x9d up to the matching funds amount.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93954(F) (West 2006).  Limiting contributions, of course, is the primary means we have upheld to combat corruption.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 23\xe2\x80\x9335, 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  Indeed the State argues that one of the principal ways that the matching funds provision combats corruption is by eliminating the possibility of any <em>quid pro quo</em> between private interests and publicly funded candidates by eliminating contributions to those candidates altogether.  See Brief for State Respondents 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  But when confronted with a choice between fighting corruption and equalizing speech, the drafters of the matching funds provision chose the latter.  That significantly undermines any notion that the \xe2\x80\x9cEqual funding of candidates\xe2\x80\x9d provision is meant to serve some interest other than an interest in equalizing funds.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in \xe2\x80\x9cleveling the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d that can justify undue burdens on political speech.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Citizens United</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 34).  In <em>Davis</em>, we stated that discriminatory contribution limits meant to \xe2\x80\x9clevel electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth\xe2\x80\x9d did not serve \xe2\x80\x9ca legitimate government objective,\xe2\x80\x9d let alone a compelling one.  554 U.

And in <em>Buckley</em>, we held that limits on overall campaign expenditures could not be justified by a purported govern-ment \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 56; see <em>id</em>., at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  After all, equalizing campaign resources \xe2\x80\x9cmight serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 57.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLeveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 742\xe2\x80\x94a dangerous enterprise and one that cannot justify burdening protected speech.  The dissent essentially dismisses this concern, see <em>post</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9329, but it needs to be taken seriously; we have, as noted, held that it is not legitimate for the government to attempt to equalize electoral opportunities in this manner.  And such basic intrusion by the government into the debate over who should govern goes to the heart of First Amendment \nvalues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLeveling the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d can sound like a good thing.

But even if the ultimate objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruption\xe2\x80\x94and not \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Burdening a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the State\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption interest.  Indeed, we have said that \xe2\x80\x9creliance on personal funds <em>reduces</em> the threat of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscouraging [the] use of personal funds[\xc2\xa0] disserves the anticorruption interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 740\xe2\x80\x93741.  That is because \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of personal funds reduces the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse\xe2\x80\x9d of money in politics.  <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 53.

Arizona already has some of the most austere contribution limits in the United States.  See <em>Randall</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/230/index.html">548 U. S. 230</a>, 250\xe2\x80\x93251 (2006) (plurality opinion).  Contributions to statewide candidates are limited to $840 per contributor per election cycle and contributions to legislative candidates are limited to $410 per contributor per election cycle.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93905(A)(1), 941(B)(1); Ariz. Dept. of State, Office of the Secretary of State, 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 Contribution Limits, see <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Arizona also has stringent fundraising disclosure requirements.  In the face of such ascetic contribution limits, strict disclosure requirements, and the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps recognizing that the burdens the matching funds provision places on speech cannot be justified in \nand of themselves, either as a means of leveling the playing field or directly fighting corruption, the State and the Clean Elections Institute offer another argument: They contend that the provision indirectly serves the anticorruption interest, by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the State\xe2\x80\x99s public funding system, which in turn helps combat corruption.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  See Brief for State Respondents 46\xe2\x80\x9347; Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Institute 47\xe2\x80\x9349.  We have said that a voluntary system of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 96.  But the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption interest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have explained that the matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent groups.  It does so to an even greater extent than the law we invalidated in <em>Davis</em>.  We have explained that those burdens cannot be justified by a desire to \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have also explained that much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not, under our precedents, pose a danger of corruption.  In light of the foregoing analysis, the fact that the State may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to \xe2\x80\x9cfind[\xc2\xa0] the sweet-spot\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfine-tun[e]\xe2\x80\x9d its public funding system, <em>post</em>, at 26<em> </em>(Kagan, J., dissenting), to achieve its desired level of participation without an undue drain on public resources, is not a sufficient justification for the burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaw in the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.  By the State\xe2\x80\x99s logic it could grant a publicly funded candidate five dollars in matching funds for every dollar his privately financed opponent spent, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a $10,000 fine in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.  Such measures might well promote participation in public financing, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.  How the State chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters, and we have never held that \na State may burden political speech\xe2\x80\x94to the extent the matching funds provision does\xe2\x80\x94to ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.  Here the State\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method is unduly burdensome and not sufficiently justified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not today call into question the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy.  That is not our business.  But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is very much our business.  In carrying out that responsibility over the past 35 years, we have upheld some restrictions on speech and struck down others.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 35\xe2\x80\x9338, 51\xe2\x80\x9354 (upholding contribution limits and striking down expenditure limits); <em>Colorado I</em>, 518 U. S., at 608 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (invalidating ban on independent expenditures for electioneering communication); <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 437 (upholding caps on coordinated party expenditures); <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 736 (invalidating asymmetrical contribution limits triggered by candidate spending).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have said that governments<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cmay engage in public financing of election campaigns\xe2\x80\x9d and that doing so can further \xe2\x80\x9csignificant governmental interest[s],\xe2\x80\x9d such as the state interest in preventing corruption.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92\xe2\x80\x9393, 96.  But the goal of creating \na viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.  The dissent criticizes the Court for standing in the way of what the people of Arizona want.  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  But the whole point of the First Amendment is to protect speakers against unjustified government restrictions on speech, even when those restrictions reflect the will of the majority.  When it comes to protected speech, the speaker is sovereign.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.  It does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State.  The professed purpose of the state law is to cause a sufficient number of candidates to<em> </em>sign up for public financing, see <em>post</em>, at 5, which subjects them to the various restrictions on speech that go along with that program.  This goes too far; Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of\xe2\x80\x9d the First Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cwas to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[ing] discussions of candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

In both States, candidates for public office accept large campaign contributions in exchange for the promise that, after assuming office, they will rank the donors\xe2\x80\x99 interests ahead of all others.  As a result of these bargains, politicians ignore the public interest, sound public pol-\nicy languishes, and the citizens lose confidence in their government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the cancerous effect of this corruption, voters of the first State, acting through referendum, enact several campaign finance measures previously approved by this Court.  They cap campaign contributions; require disclosure of substantial donations; and create an optional\n\npublic financing program that gives candidates a fixed public subsidy if they refrain from private fundraising.  But these measures do not work.  Individuals who \xe2\x80\x9cbundle\xe2\x80\x9d campaign contributions become indispensable to candidates in need of money.  Simple disclosure fails to prevent shady dealing.  And candidates choose not to participate in the public financing system because the sums provided do not make them competitive with their privately financed opponents.  So the State remains afflicted with corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voters of the second State, having witnessed this failure, take an ever-so-slightly different tack to cleaning up their political system.  They too enact contribution limits and disclosure requirements.  But they believe that the greatest hope of eliminating corruption lies in creating an effective public financing program, which will break candidates\xe2\x80\x99 dependence on large donors and bundlers.  These voters realize, based on the first State\xe2\x80\x99s experience, that such a program will not work unless candidates agree to participate in it.  And candidates will participate only if they know that they will receive sufficient funding to run competitive races.  So the voters enact a program that carefully adjusts the money given to would-be officeholders, through the use of a matching funds mechanism, in order to provide this assurance.  The program does not discriminate against any candidate or point of view, and\nit does not restrict any person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to speak.  In fact, by providing resources to many candidates, the program creates more speech and thereby broadens public debate.  And just as the voters had hoped, the program accomplishes its mission of restoring integrity to the political system.  The second State rids itself of corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A person familiar with our country\xe2\x80\x99s core values\xe2\x80\x94our devotion to democratic self-governance, as well as to \xe2\x80\x9cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\xe2\x80\x9d debate, <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html"></a><a href="/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 270 (1964)\xe2\x80\x94might expect this Court to celebrate, or at least not to interfere with, the second State\xe2\x80\x99s success.  But today, the majority holds that the second State\xe2\x80\x99s system\xe2\x80\x94the system that produces honest government, working on behalf of all the people\xe2\x80\x94clashes with our Constitution.  The First Amendment, the majority insists, requires us all to rely on the measures employed in the first State, even when they have failed to break the stranglehold of special interests on elected officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree.  The First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose is\nto foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of ro-\nbust discussion and debate.  Nothing in Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s anti-corruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, violates this constitutional protection.  To the contrary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the First Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhancing the \xe2\x80\x9copportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 269 (internal quotation marks omitted).<em> </em>I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Campaign finance reform over the last century has focused on one key question: how to prevent massive pools of private money from corrupting our political system.

To prevent both corruption and the appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x94and so to protect our democratic system of governance\xe2\x80\x94citizens have implemented reforms designed to curb the power of special interests.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among these measures, public financing of elections has emerged as a potentially potent mechanism to preserve elected officials\xe2\x80\x99 independence.  President Theodore Roosevelt proposed the reform as early as 1907 in his State\nof the Union address.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, if the government \xe2\x80\x9cpro-\nvided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate ex-penses\xe2\x80\x9d of running a campaign, on the condition that a \xe2\x80\x9cparty receiving campaign funds from the Treasury\xe2\x80\x9d would forgo private fundraising.  42 Cong. Rec. 78 (1907).  The idea was\xe2\x80\x94and remains\xe2\x80\x94straightforward.  Candidates who rely on public, rather than private, moneys are \xe2\x80\x9cbeholden [to] no person and, if elected, should feel no post-election obligation toward any contributor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Republican Nat. Comm.</em> v. <em>FEC</em>, 487 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 280, 284 (SDNY), aff\xe2\x80\x99d <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/955/index.html">445 U. S. 955</a> (1980).  By supplanting private cash in elections, public financing eliminates the source of political corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this reason, public financing systems today dot the national landscape.  Almost one-third of the States have adopted some form of public financing, and so too has\nthe Federal Government for presidential elections.  See\nR. Garrett, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Public Financing of Congressional Campaigns: Overview and Analysis 2, 32 (2009).<font b="1"> The federal program\xe2\x80\x94which offers presidential candidates a fixed public subsidy if they abstain from private fundraising\xe2\x80\x94originated in the campaign finance law that Congress enacted in 1974 on the heels of the Watergate scandal.  Congress explained at the time that the \xe2\x80\x9cpotentia[l] for abuse\xe2\x80\x9d inherent in privately funded elections was \xe2\x80\x9call too clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 93\xe2\x80\x93689, p.\xc2\xa04 (1974).  In Congress\xe2\x80\x99s view, public financing represented the \xe2\x80\x9conly way \xe2\x80\xa6 [to] eliminate reliance on large private contributions\xe2\x80\x9d and its attendant danger of corruption, while still ensuring that a wide range of candidates had access to the ballot.  <em>Id.</em>, at 5 (emphasis deleted).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We declared the presidential public financing system con-stitutional in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>.  Congress, we stated, had created the program \xe2\x80\x9cfor the \xe2\x80\x98general welfare\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94to re-\nduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on\nour political process,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate communication by candidates with the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 91.  We reiterated \xe2\x80\x9cthat public financing as a means of eliminat-ing the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.</em>, at 96.  And finally, in rejecting a challenge based on the First Amendment, we held that the program did not \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[] or censor speech, but rather \xe2\x80\xa6 use[d] public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 92\xe2\x80\x9393.  We declared this result \xe2\x80\x9cvital to a self-governing people,\xe2\x80\x9d and so concluded that the program \xe2\x80\x9cfurther[ed], not abridge[d], pertinent First Amendment values.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 93.  We thus gave state and municipal governments the green light to adopt public financing systems along the presidential model.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this model, which distributes a lump-sum grant at the beginning of an election cycle, has a significant weakness: It lacks a mechanism for setting the subsidy at a level that will give candidates sufficient incentive to participate, while also conserving public resources.  Public financing can achieve its goals only if a meaningful number of candidates receive the state subsidy, rather than raise private funds.  See 611 F.\xc2\xa03d 510, 527 (CA9 2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cA public financing system with no participants does nothing to reduce the existence or appearance of <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption\xe2\x80\x9d).  But a public funding program must be voluntary to pass constitutional muster, because of its restrictions on contributions and expenditures.  See<em> Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95.  And candidates will choose to sign up only if the subsidy provided enables them to run competitive races.  If the grant is pegged too low, it puts the participating candidate at a disadvantage: Because he has agreed to spend no more than the amount of the subsidy, he will lack the means to respond if his privately funded opponent spends over that threshold.  So when lump-sum grants do not keep up with campaign expenditures, more and more candidates will choose not to participate.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But if the subsidy is set too high, it may impose an unsustainable burden on the public fisc.  See 611 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 527 (noting that large subsidies would make public funding \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitively expensive and spell its doom\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the least, hefty grants will waste public resources in the many state races where lack of competition makes such funding unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulty, then, is in finding the Goldilocks solution\xe2\x80\x94not too large, not too small, but just right.  And\nthis in a world of countless variables\xe2\x80\x94where the amount of money needed to run a viable campaign against a privately funded candidate depends on, among other things, the district, the office, and the election cycle.  A state may set lump-sum grants district-by-district, based on spending in past elections; but even that approach leaves out many factors\xe2\x80\x94including the resources of the privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x94that alter the competitiveness of a seat from one election to the next.  See App. 714\xe2\x80\x93716 (record evidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign spending levels in Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts).  In short, the dynamic nature of our electoral system makes <em>ex ante </em>predictions about campaign expenditures almost impossible.  And that creates a chronic problem for lump-sum public financing programs, because inaccurate estimates produce subsidies that either dissuade candidates from participating or waste taxpayer money. <font b="1"> And so States have made adjustments to the lump-sum scheme that we approved in <em>Buckley</em>, in attempts to more effectively reduce corruption.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The people of Arizona had every reason to try to develop effective anti-corruption measures.  Before turning to pub-lic financing, Arizonans voted by referendum to estab-\nlish campaign contribution limits.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93905 (West Supp. 2010).  But that effort to abate corruption, standing alone, proved unsuccessful.  Five years after the enactment of these limits, the State suffered \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst public corruption scandal in its history.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 1.  In that scandal, known\nas \xe2\x80\x9cAzScam,\xe2\x80\x9d nearly 10% of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislators were caught accepting campaign contributions or bribes in ex-change for supporting a piece of legislation.  Following that incident, the voters of Arizona decided that further reform was necessary.  Acting once again by referendum, they adopted the public funding system at issue here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The hallmark of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s program is its inventive approach to the challenge that bedevils all public financing schemes: fixing the amount of the subsidy.  For each electoral contest, the system calibrates the size of the grant automatically to provide sufficient\xe2\x80\x94but no more than sufficient\xe2\x80\x94funds to induce voluntary participation.  In effect, the program\xe2\x80\x99s designers found the Goldilocks solution, which produces the \xe2\x80\x9cjust right\xe2\x80\x9d grant to ensure that a participant in the system has the funds needed to run a competitive race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds arrangement responds to the shortcoming of the lump-sum model by adjusting the public subsidy in each race to re-flect the expenditures of a privately financed candidate and the independent groups that support him.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93940 <em>et seq</em>. (West 2006 and West Supp. 2010).  A publicly financed candidate in Arizona receives an initial lump-sum to get his campaign off the ground.  See \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93951 (West 2006).  But for every dollar his privately funded opponent (or the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s supporters) spends over the initial subsidy, the publicly funded candidate will\xe2\x80\x94to a point\xe2\x80\x94get an additional 94 cents.  See \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952 (West Supp. 2010).  Once the publicly financed candidate has received three times the amount of the initial disbursement, he gets no further public funding, see <em>ibid.</em>, and remains barred from receiving private contributions, no matter how much more his privately funded opponent spends, see \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93941(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This arrangement, like the lump-sum model, makes use of a pre-set amount to provide financial support to participants.  For example, all publicly funded legislative candidates collect an initial grant of $21,479 for a general election race.  And they can in no circumstances receive more than three times that amount ($64,437); after that, their privately funded competitors hold a marked advantage.  But the Arizona system improves on the lump-sum model in a crucial respect.  By tying public funding to private spending, the State can afford to set a more generous upper limit\xe2\x80\x94because it knows that in each campaign it will only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a par-ticipating candidate reasonably competitive.  Arizona can therefore assure candidates that, if they accept public funds, they will have the resources to run a viable race against those who rely on private money.  And at the same time, Arizona avoids wasting taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dollars.  In this way, the Clean Elections Act creates an effective and sustainable public financing system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question here is whether this modest adjustment to the public financing program that we approved in <em>Buckley </em>makes the Arizona law unconstitutional.  The majority contends that the matching funds provision \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially burdens protected political speech\xe2\x80\x9d and does not \xe2\x80\x9cserv[e] a compelling state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  But the Court is wrong on both counts.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute does not impose a \xe2\x80\x9crestriction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 15, or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantia[l] burde[n],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 2, on expression.  The law has quite the opposite effect: It subsidizes and so produces <em>more</em> political speech.  We recognized in <em>Buckley</em> that, for this reason, public financing of elections \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate[s] and enlarge[s] public discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d in support of First Amendment values.  424 U. S., at 92\xe2\x80\x9393.  And what we said then is just as true today.  Except in a world gone topsy-turvy, additional campaign speech and electoral competition is not a First Amendment injury.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At every turn, the majority tries to convey the im-pression that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching fund statute is of a\npiece with laws prohibiting electoral speech.  The majority invokes the language of \xe2\x80\x9climits,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbar[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crestraints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.

It insists that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cre-strict[s] the speech of some elements of our society\xe2\x80\x9d to enhance the speech of others.  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  And it concludes by reminding us that the point of the First Amendment is to protect \xe2\x80\x9cagainst unjustified government restrictions on speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 29.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is just one problem. Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds provision does not restrict, but instead subsidizes, speech.  The law \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] no ceiling on [speech] and do[es] not prevent anyone from speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Citizens United</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 51) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 92 (holding that a public financing law does not \xe2\x80\x9cabridge, restrict, or censor\xe2\x80\x9d expression).  The statute does not tell candidates or their supporters how much money they can spend to convey their message, when they can spend it, or what they can spend it on.  Rather, the Arizona law, like the public financing statute in <em>Buckley</em>, provides funding for political speech, thus \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[ing] communication by candidates with the elec-torate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 91.  By enabling participating candidates to respond to their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 expression, the statute expands public debate, in adherence to \xe2\x80\x9cour tradition\nthat more speech, not less, is the governing rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Citizens United</em>, 558 U.

In case after case, year upon year, we have distinguished between speech restrictions and speech subsidies.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98There is a basic difference,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we have held, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98between direct state interference with [First Amendment] protected activity and state encouragement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of other expression.  <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U.

That is because subsidies, by definition and contra the majority, do not restrict any speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one can claim that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law discriminates against particular ideas, and so violates the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s sole limitation on speech subsidies.  The State throws open the doors of its public financing program to all candidates who meet minimal eligibility requirements and agree not to raise private funds.  Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals may participate; so too, the law applies equally to independent expenditure groups across the political spectrum.  Arizona disburses funds based not on a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s (or supporter\xe2\x80\x99s) ideas, but on the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sign up for public funding.  So under our precedent, Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s subsidy statute should easily survive First Amendment scrutiny.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This suit, in fact, may merit less attention than any challenge to a speech subsidy ever seen in this Court.  In the usual First Amendment subsidy case, a person complains that the government declined to finance his speech, while bankrolling someone else\xe2\x80\x99s; we must then decide whether the government differentiated between these speakers on a prohibited basis\xe2\x80\x94because it preferred one speaker\xe2\x80\x99s ideas to another\xe2\x80\x99s.  See, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 577\xe2\x80\x93578; <em>Regan</em>, 461 U. S., at 543\xe2\x80\x93545.  But the candidates bringing this challenge do not make that claim\xe2\x80\x94because they were never denied a subsidy.  Arizona, remember, offers to support any person running for state office.  Petitioners here <em>refused </em>that assistance.  So they are making a novel argument: that Arizona violated <em>their</em> First Amendment rights by disbursing funds to <em>other</em> speakers even\nthough they could have received (but chose to spurn) the same financial assistance.  Some people might call that <em>chutzpah</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, what petitioners demand is essentially a right to quash others\xe2\x80\x99 speech through the prohibition of a (universally available) subsidy program.  Petitioners are able to convey their ideas without public financing\xe2\x80\x94and they would prefer the field to themselves, so that they can speak free from response.  To attain that goal, they ask this Court to prevent Arizona from funding electoral speech\xe2\x80\x94even though that assistance is offered to every state candidate, on the same (entirely unobjectionable) basis.  And this Court gladly obliges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If an ordinary citizen, without the hindrance of a law degree, thought this result an upending of First Amendment values, he would be correct.  That Amendment\nprotects no person\xe2\x80\x99s, nor any candidate\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cright to be free from vigorous debate.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

And this is no place more true than in elections, where voters\xe2\x80\x99 ability to choose the best representatives depends on debate\xe2\x80\x94on charge and countercharge, call and response.  So to invalidate a statute that restricts no one\xe2\x80\x99s speech and dis-criminates against no idea\xe2\x80\x94that only provides more voices, wider discussion, and greater competition in elections\xe2\x80\x94is to undermine, rather than to enforce, the First Amendment.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We said all this in <em>Buckley</em>, when we upheld the presidential public financing system\xe2\x80\x94a ruling this Court has never since questioned.  The principal challenge to that system came from minor-party candidates not eligible for benefits\xe2\x80\x94surely more compelling plaintiffs than petitioners, who could have received funding but refused it.  Yet we rejected that attack in part because we understood the federal program as supporting, rather than interfering with, expression.  See 424 U. S., at 90\xe2\x80\x93108; see also <em>Regan</em>, 461 U. S., at 549 (relying on <em>Buckley</em> to hold that selective subsidies of expression comport with the First Amendment if they are viewpoint neutral).  <em>Buckley </em>rejected any idea, along the lines the majority proposes, that a subsidy of electoral speech was in truth a restraint.  And more: <em>Buckley</em> recognized that public financing of elections <em>fosters</em> First Amendment principles.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he central purpose of the Speech and Press Clauses,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to assure a society in which \xe2\x80\x98uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\xe2\x80\x99 public debate concerning matters of public interest would thrive, for only in such a society can a healthy representative democracy flourish.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 93,\nn. 127 (quoting <em>New York Times</em>, 376 U. S., at 270).  And we continued: \xe2\x80\x9c[L]aws providing financial assistance to the exercise of free speech\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including the campaign finance statute at issue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cenhance these First Amendment values.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.

According to the Court, the special problem here lies in Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s matching funds mechanism, which the majority claims imposes a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantia[l] burde[n]\xe2\x80\x9d on a privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  Sometimes, the majority suggests that this \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d lies in the way the mechanism \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98diminish[es] the effectiveness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expression by enabling his opponent to respond.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html">554 U. S. 724</a>, 736 (2008)); see <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  At other times, the majority indicates that the \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d resides in the deterrent effect of the mechanism: The privately funded candidate \xe2\x80\x9cmight not spend money\xe2\x80\x9d because doing so will trigger matching funds.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  Either way, the majority is wrong to see a substantial burden on expression.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most important, and as just suggested, the very notion that additional speech constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d is odd and unsettling.  Here is a simple fact: Arizona imposes nothing remotely resembling a coercive penalty on privately funded candidates.  The State does not jail them, fine them, or subject them to any kind of lesser disability.  (So the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analogies to a fine on speech, <em>ante</em>, at 19, 28, are inapposite.)  The only \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d in this case comes from the grant of a subsidy to another person, and the opportunity that subsidy allows for responsive speech.  But that means the majority cannot get out from under our subsidy precedents.  Once again: We have never, not once, understood a viewpoint-neutral subsidy given to one speaker to constitute a First Amendment burden on another.  (And that is so even when the subsidy is not open to all, as it is here.)  Yet in this case, the majority says that the prospect of more speech\xe2\x80\x94responsive speech, competitive speech, the kind of speech that drives public debate\xe2\x80\x94counts as a constitutional injury.  That concept, for all the reasons previously given, is \xe2\x80\x9cwholly foreign to the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 49.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But put to one side this most fundamental objection\nto the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument; even then, has the majority shown that the burden resulting from the Arizona statute is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d?  See <em>Clingman</em> v. <em>Beaver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/581/index.html">544 U. S. 581</a>, 592 (2005) (holding that stringent judicial review is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate only if the burden is severe\xe2\x80\x9d).  I will not quarrel with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that responsive speech by one candidate may make another candidate\xe2\x80\x99s speech less effective, see <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322; that, after all, is the whole idea of the First Amendment, and a <em>benefit</em> of having more responsive speech.  See <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/250/616/index.html">250 U. S. 616</a>, 630 (1919) (Holmes., J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market\xe2\x80\x9d).  And I will assume that the operation of this statute may on occasion deter a privately funded candidate from spending money, and conveying ideas by that means.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  My guess is that this does not happen often: Most political candidates, I suspect, have enough faith in the power of their ideas to prefer speech on both sides of an issue to speech on neither.  But I will take on faith that the matching funds provision may lead one or another privately funded candidate to stop spending at one or another moment in an election.  Still, does that effect count as a severe burden on expression?  By the measure of our prior decisions\xe2\x80\x94which have upheld campaign reforms with an equal or greater impact on speech\xe2\x80\x94the answer is no.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number one: <em>Any </em>system of public financing, including the lump-sum model upheld in <em>Buckley</em>, imposes a similar burden on privately funded candidates.  Suppose Arizona were to do what all parties agree it could under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x94provide a single upfront payment (say, $150,000) to a participating candidate, rather than an initial payment\n(of $50,000) plus 94% of whatever his privately funded opponent spent, up to a ceiling (the same $150,000).  That system would \xe2\x80\x9cdiminis[h] the effectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d of a privately funded candidate\xe2\x80\x99s speech at least as much, and in the same way: It would give his opponent, who presumably would not be able to raise that sum on his own, more money to spend.  And so too, a lump-sum system may deter speech.  A person relying on private resources might well choose not to enter a race at all, because he knows he will face an adequately funded opponent.  And even if he decides to run, he likely will choose to speak in different ways\xe2\x80\x94for example, by eschewing dubious, easy-to-answer charges\xe2\x80\x94because his opponent has the ability to respond.  Indeed, privately funded candidates may well find the lump-sum system <em>more </em>burdensome than Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s (assuming the lump is big enough).  Pretend you are financing your campaign through private donations.  Would you prefer that your opponent receive a guaranteed, upfront payment of $150,000, or that he receive only $50,000, with the <em>possibility</em>\xe2\x80\x94a possibility that you mostly get to control\xe2\x80\x94of collecting another $100,000 somewhere down the road?  Me too.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the first reason the burden on speech cannot command a different result in this case than in <em>Buckley</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number two: Our decisions about disclosure and disclaimer requirements show the Court is wrong.  Starting in <em>Buckley </em>and continuing through last Term, the Court has repeatedly declined to view these requirements as a sub-stantial First Amendment burden, even though they dis-courage some campaign speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is undoubtedly true,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated in <em>Buckley</em>, that public disclosure obliga-\ntions \xe2\x80\x9cwill deter some individuals\xe2\x80\x9d from engaging in expressive activity.  424 U. S., at 68; see <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 744.  Yet we had no difficulty upholding these requirements there.  And much more recently, in <em>Citizens United</em> and <em>Doe</em> v. <em>Reed</em>, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), we followed that precedent.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d we reasoned, but they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not prevent anyone from speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting <em>Citizens United</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51)).  So too here.  Like a disclosure rule, the matching funds provision may occasionally deter, but \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] no ceiling\xe2\x80\x9d on electoral expression.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 51).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority breezily dismisses this comparison, labeling the analogy \xe2\x80\x9cnot even close\xe2\x80\x9d because disclosure requirements result in no payment of money to a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s opponent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  That is indeed the factual distinction: A matching fund provision, we can all agree, is not a disclosure rule.  But the majority does not tell us why this difference matters.  Nor could it.  The majority strikes down the matching funds provision because of its ostensible <em>effect</em>\xe2\x80\x94most notably, that it may deter a person from spending money in an election.  But this Court has acknowledged time and again that disclosure obligations have the selfsame effect.  If that consequence does not trigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case, it should not do so in the other.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number three: Any burden that the Arizona law imposes does not exceed the burden associated with contri-bution limits, which we have also repeatedly upheld.  Con-tribution limits, we have stated, \xe2\x80\x9cimpose <em>direct quantity restrictions</em> on political communication and association,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added), thus \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significant[ly] interfer[ing]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with First Amendment interests, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 387 (2000) (quoting <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 25).  Rather than potentially deterring or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98diminish[ing] the effectiveness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of expressive activity, <em>ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 736), these limits stop it cold.  Yet we have never subjected these restrictions to the most stringent review.  See <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 29\xe2\x80\x9338.  I doubt I have to reiterate that the Arizona statute imposes no restraints on any expressive activity.  So the majority once again has no reason here to reach a different result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this way, our campaign finance cases join our speech subsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law.  Both sets of precedents are in accord that a statute funding electoral speech in the way Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s does imposes no First Amendment injury.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority thinks it has one case on its side<em>\xe2\x80\x94Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html">554 U. S. 724</a>\xe2\x80\x94and it pegs everything on that decision.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  But\n<em>Davis </em>relies on principles that fit securely within our\nFirst Amendment law and tradition\xe2\x80\x94most unlike today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority recounts, <em>Davis </em>addressed the constitutionality of federal legislation known as the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment.  Under that provision (which applied in elec-tions not involving public financing), a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of more than $350,000 of his own money activated a change in applicable contribution limits.  Before, each candidate in the race could accept $2,300 from any donor; but now, the opponent of the self-financing candidate could accept three times that much, or up to $6,900 per contributor.  So one candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of personal funds on campaign speech triggered discriminatory contribution restrictions favoring that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the First Amendment, the similarity between <em>Davis </em>and this case matters far less than the differences.  Here is the similarity: In both cases, one candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign expenditure triggered \xe2\x80\xa6 something.  Now here are the differences: In <em>Davis</em>, the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure triggered a discriminatory speech restriction, which Congress could not otherwise have imposed consistent with the First Amendment; by contrast, in this case, the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure triggers a non-discriminatory speech subsidy, which all parties agree Arizona could have provided in the first instance.  In First Amendment law, that difference makes a difference\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it makes <em>all </em>the difference.  As I have indicated before, two great fault lines run through our First Amendment doctrine: one, between speech restrictions and speech subsidies, and the other, between discriminatory and neutral government action.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment fell on the disfavored side of both divides: To reiterate, it imposed a discriminatory speech restriction.  The Arizona Clean Elections Act lands on the opposite side of both: It grants a non-discriminatory speech subsidy.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  So to say that <em>Davis </em>\xe2\x80\x9clargely controls\xe2\x80\x9d this case, <em>ante</em>, at 10, is to decline to take our First Amendment doctrine seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And let me be clear: This is not my own idiosyncratic\nor <em>post hoc</em> view of <em>Davis;</em> it is the <em>Davis </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s self-expressed, contemporaneous view.  That decision began, continued, and ended by focusing on the Millionaire Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory<em> </em>contribution limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U. S., at 740.  We made that clear in the very first sentence of the opinion, where we summarized the question presented.  <em>Id.</em>, at 728 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn this appeal, we consider the constitutionality of federal election law provisions that \xe2\x80\xa6 impose different campaign contribution limits on candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).  And our focus on the law\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory restrictions was evident again when we examined how the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior holdings informed the case.  <em>Id.</em>, at 738 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).  And then again, when we concluded that the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment could not stand.  <em>Id.</em>, at 740 (explaining that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits\xe2\x80\x9d burdens speech).  Our decision left no doubt (because we repeated the point many times over, see also <em>id.</em>, at 729, 730, 739, 740, n.\xc2\xa07, 741, 744): The constitutional problem with the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment lay in its use of discriminatory speech restrictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what of the trigger mechanism\xe2\x80\x94in <em>Davis</em>, as here, a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign expenditures?  That, after all, is the only thing that this case and <em>Davis </em>share.  If <em>Davis </em>had held that the trigger mechanism itself violated the First Amendment, then the case would support today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  But <em>Davis </em>said nothing of the kind.  It made clear that\nthe trigger mechanism could not <em>rescue </em>the discriminatory contribution limits from constitutional invalidity; that the limits went into effect only after a candidate spent substantial personal resources rendered them no more permissible under the First Amendment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 739.  But <em>Davis </em>did not call into question the trigger mechanism itself.  Indeed, <em>Davis </em>explained that Congress could have used that mechanism to activate a <em>non-discriminatory</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, across-the-board)<em> </em>increase in contribution limits; in that case, the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cDavis\xe2\x80\x99 argument would plainly fail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 737.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The constitutional infirmity in <em>Davis </em>was not the trigger mechanism, but rather what lay on the other side of it\xe2\x80\x94a discriminatory speech restriction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s response to these points is difficult to fathom.  The majority concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cour decision in <em>Davis </em>focused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by the Millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  That was because, the majority explains, <em>Davis </em>presented only that issue.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14<em>.  </em>And yet, the majority insists (without explaining how this can be true), the reach of <em>Davis </em>is not so limited.  And in any event, the majority claims, the burden on speech is \xe2\x80\x9cgreater in this case than in <em>Davis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14<em>.  </em>But for reasons already stated, that is not\nso.  The burden on speech in <em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x94the penalty that cam-paign spending triggered\xe2\x80\x94<em>was </em>the discriminatory contribution restriction, which Congress could not otherwise have imposed.  By contrast, the thing triggered here is a non-discriminatory subsidy, of a kind this Court has approved for almost four decades.  Maybe the majority is saying today that it had something like this case in mind all the time.  But nothing in the logic of <em>Davis </em>controls this decision.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, the Court errs in holding that the government action in this case substantially burdens speech and so requires the State to offer a compelling in-terest.  But in any event, Arizona has come forward with just such an interest, explaining that the Clean Elections Act attacks corruption and the appearance of corruption in the State\xe2\x80\x99s political system.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s denigration of this interest\xe2\x80\x94the suggestion that it either is not real or does not matter\xe2\x80\x94wrongly prevents Arizona from protecting the strength and integrity of its democracy.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our campaign finance precedents leave no doubt: Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is a compelling government interest.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em>, 554 U. S., at 741; <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/index.html">470 U. S. 480</a>, 496\xe2\x80\x93497 (1985) <em>(NCPAC)</em>.  And so too, these precedents are clear: Public financing of elections serves this interest.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  As <em>Buckley </em>recognized, and as I earlier described, public financing \xe2\x80\x9creduce[s] the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 91; see <em>id.</em>, at 96.  When private contributions fuel the political system, candidates may make corrupt bargains to gain the money needed to win election.  See <em>NCPAC</em>, 470 U. S., at 497.  And voters, seeing the dependence of candidates on large contributors (or on bundlers of smaller contributions), may lose faith that their representatives will serve the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest.  See <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 390 (the \xe2\x80\x9cassumption that large donors call the tune [may] jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance\xe2\x80\x9d).  Public financing addresses these dangers by minimizing the importance of private donors in elections.  Even the majority appears to agree with this premise.  See <em>ante,</em> at 27 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have said that \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This compelling interest appears on the very face of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s public financing statute.  Start with the title: The Citizens Clean Elections Act.  Then proceed to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s formal findings.  The public financing program, the findings state, was \xe2\x80\x9cinten[ded] to create a clean elections system that will improve the integrity of Arizona state government by diminishing the influence of special-interest money.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93940(A) (West 2006).  That measure was needed because the prior system of private fundraising had \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ndermine[d] public confidence in the integrity of public officials;\xe2\x80\x9d allowed those officials \xe2\x80\x9cto accept large campaign contributions from private interests over which they [had] governmental jurisdiction;\xe2\x80\x9d favored \xe2\x80\x9ca small number of wealthy special interests\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast majority of Arizona citizens;\xe2\x80\x9d<font b="1"> and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]os[t] average taxpayers millions of dollars in the form of subsidies and special privileges for campaign contributors.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93940(B).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The State, appearing before us, has reiterated its important anti-corruption interest.  The Clean Elections Act, the State avers, \xe2\x80\x9cdeters <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption and the appearance of corruption by providing Arizona candidates with an option to run for office without depending on outside contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 19.  And so Arizona, like many state and local governments, has implemented public financing on the theory (which this Court has previously approved, see <em>supra</em>, at 5), that the way to reduce political corruption is to diminish the role of private donors in campaigns.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that interest justifies the matching funds provision at issue because it is a critical facet of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s public financing program.  The provision is no more than a disbursement mechanism; but it is also the thing that makes the whole Clean Elections Act work.  As described earlier, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, public financing has an Achilles heel\xe2\x80\x94the difficulty of setting the subsidy at the right amount.  Too small, and the grant will not attract candidates to the program; and with no participating candidates, the program can hardly decrease corruption.  Too large, and the system becomes unsustainable, or at the least an unnecessary drain on public resources.  But finding the sweet-spot is near impossible because of variation, across districts and over time, in the political system.  Enter the matching funds provision, which takes an ordinary lump-sum amount, divides it into thirds, and disburses the last two of these (to the extent necessary) via a self-calibrating mechanism.  That provision is just a fine-tuning of the lump-sum program approved in <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x94a fine-tuning, it bears repeating, that prevents no one from speaking and discriminates against no message.  But that fine-tuning can make the difference between a wholly ineffectual program and one that removes corruption from the political system.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  If public financing furthers a compelling interest\xe2\x80\x94and according to this Court, it does\xe2\x80\x94then so too does the disbursement formula that Arizona uses to make public financing effective.  The one conclusion follows directly from the other.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Except in this Court, where the inescapable logic of the State\xe2\x80\x99s position is \xe2\x80\xa6 virtually ignored.  The Court, to be sure, repeatedly asserts that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing corruption does not \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently justif[y]\xe2\x80\x9d the mechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys.  <em>Ante</em>, at 28; see <em>ante</em>, at 27.  Only one thing is missing from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s response: any reasoning to support this conclusion.  Nowhere does the majority dispute the State\xe2\x80\x99s view that the success of its public financing system depends on the matching funds mechanism; and nowhere does the majority contest that, if this mechanism indeed spells the difference between success and failure, the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing corruption justifies its use.  And so the majority dismisses, but does not actually answer the State\xe2\x80\x99s contention\xe2\x80\x94even though that contention is the linchpin of the entire case.  Assuming (against reason and precedent) that the matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, the question becomes whether the State has offered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.  Arizona has made a forceful argument on this score,\nbased on the need to establish an effective public fi-nancing system.  The majority does not even engage that reasoning.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying to show that \xe2\x80\x9clevel[ing] the playing field,\xe2\x80\x9d not fighting corruption, was the State\xe2\x80\x99s real goal.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s distaste for \xe2\x80\x9cleveling\xe2\x80\x9d provides no excuse for striking down Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For starters, the Court has no basis to question the sincerity of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in rooting out political corruption.  As I have just explained, that is the interest the State has asserted in this Court; it is the interest predominantly expressed in the \xe2\x80\x9cfindings and declarations\xe2\x80\x9d section of the statute; and it is the interest universally understood (stretching back to Teddy Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s time) to support public financing of elections.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  As against all this, the majority claims to have found three smoking guns that reveal the State\xe2\x80\x99s true (and nefarious) intention to level the playing field.  But the only smoke here is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s, and it is the kind that goes with mirrors.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority first observes that the matching funds provision is titled \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Equal funding of candidates\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that it refers to matching grants as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98equalizing funds.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 23 (quoting \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93952).  Well, yes.  The statute provides for matching funds (above and below certain thresholds); a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cequal\xe2\x80\x9d; and so the statute uses that term.  In sum, the statute describes what the statute does.  But the relevant question here (according to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis) is <em>why </em>the statute does that thing\xe2\x80\x94otherwise said, what interest the statute serves.  The State explains that its goal is to prevent corruption, and nothing in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s descriptive terms suggests any other objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the majority notes that the Act allows participating candidates to accept private contributions if (but only if) the State cannot provide the funds it has promised (for example, because of a budget crisis).  <em>Ante, </em>at 23 (citing \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93954(F)).  That provision, the majority argues, shows that when push comes to shove, the State cares more about \xe2\x80\x9cleveling\xe2\x80\x9d than about fighting corruption.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  But this is a plain misreading of the law.  All the statute does is assure participating candidates that they will not be left in the lurch if public funds suddenly become unavailable.  That guarantee helps persuade candidates to enter the program by removing the risk of a state default.  And so the provision directly advances the Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of combating corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court remarks in a footnote that the Clean Elections Commission\xe2\x80\x99s website once stated that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Act was passed by the people of Arizona \xe2\x80\xa6 to level the playing field.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24, n.\xc2\xa010.  I can understand why\nthe majority does not place much emphasis on this point.  Some members of the majority have ridiculed the practice of relying on subsequent<em> </em>statements by legislators to demonstrate an earlier Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent in enacting a statute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Finkelstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/617/index.html">496 U. S. 617</a>, 631\xe2\x80\x93632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/415/index.html">555 U. S. 415</a>, 434\xe2\x80\x93435 (2009) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  Yet here the majority makes a much stranger claim: that a statement appearing on a government website in 2011 (written by who-knows-whom?) reveals what hundreds of thousands of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s voters sought to do in 1998 when they enacted the Clean Elections Act by referendum.  Just to state that proposition is to know it is wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the majority has no evidence\xe2\x80\x94zero, none\xe2\x80\x94that the objective of the Act is anything other than the interest that the State asserts, the Act proclaims, and the history of public financing supports: fighting corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But suppose the majority had come up with some evidence showing that Arizona had sought to \xe2\x80\x9cequalize electoral opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  Would that discovery matter?  Our precedent says no, so long as Arizona had a compelling interest in eliminating political corruption (which it clearly did).  In these circumstances, any interest of the State in \xe2\x80\x9cleveling\xe2\x80\x9d should be irrelevant.  That interest could not support Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law (assuming the law burdened speech), but neither would the interest invalidate the legislation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To see the point, consider how the matter might arise.  Assume a State has two reasons to pass a statute affecting speech.  It wants to reduce corruption.  But in addition,\nit wishes to \xe2\x80\x9clevel the playing field.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under our First Amendment law, the interest in preventing corruption is compelling and may justify restraints on speech.  But the interest in \xe2\x80\x9cleveling the playing field,\xe2\x80\x9d according to well-established precedent, cannot support such legislation.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  So would this statute (assuming it met all other constitutional standards) violate the First Amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer must be no.  This Court, after all, has never said that a law restricting speech (or any other constitutional right) demands two compelling interests.  One is enough.  And this statute has one: preventing corruption.  So it does not matter that equalizing campaign speech is an insufficient interest.  The statute could violate the First Amendment only if \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing\xe2\x80\x9d qualified as a forbidden motive\xe2\x80\x94a motive that itself could annul an otherwise constitutional law.  But we have never held that to be so.  And that should not be surprising: It is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle of constitutional adjudication,\xe2\x80\x9d from which we have deviated only in exceptional cases, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U. S. 367</a>, 383 (1968); see <em>id.</em>, at 384 (declining to invalidate a statute when \xe2\x80\x9cCongress had the undoubted power to enact\xe2\x80\x9d it without the suspect motive); accord, <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 652 (1994); <em>Renton</em> v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/41/index.html">475 U. S. 41</a>, 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (1986).  When a law is otherwise constitutional\xe2\x80\x94when it either does not restrict speech or rests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restriction\xe2\x80\x94that is the end of the story.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That proposition disposes of this case, even if Arizona had an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral opportunities.  No special rule of automatic invalidation applies to statutes having some connection to equality; like any other laws, they pass muster when supported by an im-portant enough government interest.  Here, Arizona has demonstrated in detail how the matching funds provision is necessary to serve a compelling interest in combating corruption.  So the hunt for evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cleveling\xe2\x80\x9d is a waste of time; Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law survives constitutional scrutiny no matter what that search would uncover.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arose because Arizonans wanted their government to work on behalf of all the State\xe2\x80\x99s people.  On the heels of a political scandal involving the near-routine purchase of legislators\xe2\x80\x99 votes, Arizonans passed a law de-signed to sever political candidates\xe2\x80\x99 dependence on large contributors.  They wished, as many of their fellow Americans wish, to stop corrupt dealing\xe2\x80\x94to ensure that their representatives serve the public, and not just the wealthy donors who helped put them in office.  The legislation that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s voters enacted was the product of deep thought and care.  It put into effect a public financing system\nthat attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustainable cost to the State\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayers.  The system discriminated against no ideas and prevented no speech.  Indeed, by increasing electoral competition and enabling a wide range of candidates to express their views, the system \xe2\x80\x9cfurther[ed] \xe2\x80\xa6 First Amendment values.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 93 (citing <em>New York Times</em>, 376 U. S., at 270).  Less corruption, more speech.  Robust campaigns leading to the election of representatives not beholden to the few, but accountable to the many.  The people of Arizona might have expected a decent respect for those objectives.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, they do not get it.  The Court invalidates Arizonans\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to ensure that in their State, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he people \xe2\x80\xa6 possess the absolute sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 274 (quoting James Madison in 4 Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s Debates on the Federal Constitution 569\xe2\x80\x93570 (1876)).  No precedent compels the Court to take this step; to the contrary, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is in tension with broad swaths of our First Amendment doctrine.  No fundamental principle of our Constitution backs the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling; to the contrary, it is the law struck down today that fostered both the vigorous competition of ideas and its ultimate object\xe2\x80\x94a government responsive to the will of the people.  Arizonans deserve better.  Like citizens across this country, Arizonans deserve a government that represents and serves them all.  And no less, Arizonans deserve the chance to reform their electoral system so as to attain that most American of goals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Truly, democracy is not a game.  See <em>ante</em>, at 25.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The problem is apparent in the federal system.  In recent years, the number of presidential candidates opting to receive public financing has declined because the subsidy has not kept pace with spending\nby privately financed candidates.  See Corrado, Public Funding of Presidential Campaigns, in The New Campaign Finance Sourcebook 180, 200 (A. Corrado, T. Mann, D. Ortiz, &amp; T. Potter eds. 2005).  The last election cycle offers a stark example: Then-candidate Barack Obama raised $745.7 million in private funds in 2008, Federal Election Commission, 2008 Presidential Campaign Financial Activity Summarized, June 8, 2009, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/\n20090608PresStat.shtml, in contrast with the $105.4 million he could have received in public funds, see Federal Election Commission, Presidential Election Campaign Fund, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/\nbkgnd/fund.shtml (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0And the law appears to do that job well.  Between 1998 (when the statute was enacted) and 2006, overall candidate expenditures increased between 29% and 67%; overall independent expenditures rose by a whopping 253%; and average candidate expenditures grew by 12% to 40%.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x93239, pp. 284\xe2\x80\x93285; App. 916\xe2\x80\x93917.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority claims that none of our subsidy cases involved the funding of \xe2\x80\x9crespons[ive]\xe2\x80\x9d expression.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.  But the majority does not explain why this distinction, created to fit the facts of this case, should matter so long as the government is not discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.  Indeed, the difference the majority highlights should cut in the opposite direction, because facilitating responsive speech fosters \xe2\x80\x9cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\xe2\x80\x9d public debate.  <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html"></a><a href="/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 270 (1964).  In any event, the majority is wrong to say that we have never approved funding to \xe2\x80\x9callow the recipient to counter\xe2\x80\x9d someone else\xe2\x80\x99s political speech.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  That is <em>exactly </em>what we approved in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  The majority notes that the public financing scheme in <em>Buckley</em> lacked the trigger mechanism used in the Arizona law.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa09.  But again, that is just to describe a difference, not to say why it matters.  As I will show, the trigger is constitutionally irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94as we made clear in the very case (<em>Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html"></a><a href="/us/554/724/index.html">554 U. S. 724</a> (2008)) on which the majority principally relies.  See <em>infra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority argues that more speech will quickly become \xe2\x80\x9cless speech,\xe2\x80\x9d as candidates switch to public funding.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa07.<em> </em>But that claim misunderstands how a voluntary public financing system works.  Candidates with significant financial resources will likely decline public funds, so that they can spend in excess of the system\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure caps.  Other candidates accept public financing because they believe it will enhance their communication with voters.  So the system continually pushes toward more speech.  That is exactly what has happened in Arizona, see n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>, and the majority offers no counter-examples.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s error on this score extends both to candidates and to independent expenditure groups.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06, nearly all of my arguments showing that the Clean Elections Act does not impose a substantial burden apply to both sets of speakers (and apply regardless of whether independent or candidate expenditures trigger the matching funds).  That is also true of every one of my arguments demonstrating the State\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest in this legislation.  See <em>infra</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9326.  But perhaps the best response to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Act inhibits independent expenditure groups lies in an empirical fact already noted: Expenditures by these groups have risen by 253% since Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law was enacted.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I will note, however, that the record evidence of this effect is spotty at best.  The majority finds anecdotal evidence supporting its argument on just 6 pages of a 4500-page summary judgment record.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  (The majority also cites sections of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 briefs, which cite the same 6 pages in the record.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19.)  That is consistent with the assessment of the District Court Judge who presided over the proceedings in this case: He stated that petitioners had presented only \xe2\x80\x9cvague\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cscattered\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of the law\xe2\x80\x99s deterrent impact.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x93239, p. 54.  The appellate court discerned even less evidence of any deterrent effect.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo Plaintiff \xe2\x80\xa6 has pointed to any specific instance in which she or he has declined a contribution or failed to make an expenditure for fear of triggering matching funds\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.</em>, at 28, 31, 34.  I understand the majority to essentially concede this point (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is never easy to prove a negative,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20) and to say it does not matter (\xe2\x80\x9cwe do not need empirical evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>).  So I will not belabor the issue by detailing the substantial testimony (much more than 6 pages worth) that the matching funds provision has not put a dent in privately funded candidates\xe2\x80\x99 spending.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course, only publicly funded candidates receive the subsidy.  But that is because only those candidates have agreed to abide by stringent spending caps (which privately funded candidates can exceed by any amount).  And <em>Buckley </em>specifically approved that exchange as consistent with the First Amendment.  See 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95.  By contrast, <em>Davis </em>involved a scheme in which one candidate in a race received concrete fundraising advantages, in the form of asymmetrical contribution limits, just because his opponent had spent a certain amount of his own money.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Notably, the Court found this conclusion obvious even though an across-the-board increase in contribution limits works to the comparative advantage of the non-self-financing candidate\xe2\x80\x94that is, the candidate who actually depends on contributions.  Such a system puts the self-financing candidate to a choice: Do I stop spending, or do I allow the higher contribution limits (which will help my opponent) to kick in?  That strategic choice parallels the one that the Arizona statute forces.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority also briefly relies on <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/index.html">418 U. S. 241</a> (1974), but that case is still wider of the mark.  There, we invalidated a law compelling newspapers (by threat of criminal sanction) to print a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder to critical commentary.  That law, we explained, overrode the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s own editorial judgment and forced the paper both to pay for and to convey a message with which it disagreed.  See <em>id.</em>, at 256\xe2\x80\x93258.  An analogy might be if Arizona forced privately funded candidates to purchase their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 posters, and then to display those posters in their own campaign offices.  But that is very far from this case.  The Arizona statute does not require petitioners to disseminate or fund any opposing speech; nor does it in any way associate petitioners with that speech.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The legislative findings also echo what the <em>Buckley </em>Court found true of public financing\xe2\x80\x94that it \xe2\x80\x9cencourage[s] citizen participation in the political process\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpromote[s] freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d by enhancing the ability of candidates to \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicat[e] to voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x93940(A), (B).</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority briefly suggests that the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caustere contribution limits\xe2\x80\x9d lessen the need for public financing, see <em>ante</em>, at 26, but provides no support for that dubious claim.  As Arizona and other jurisdictions have discovered, contribution limits may not eliminate the risk of corrupt dealing between candidates and donors, especially given the widespread practice of bundling small contributions into large packages.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 31.  For much this reason, <em>Buckley</em> upheld <em>both</em> limits on contributions to federal candidates <em>and</em> public financing of presidential campaigns.  See 424 U. S., at 23\xe2\x80\x9338, 90\xe2\x80\x93108.  Arizona, like Congress, was \xe2\x80\x9csurely entitled to conclude\xe2\x80\x9d that contribution limits were only a \xe2\x80\x9cpartial measure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 28, and that a functional public financing system was also necessary to eliminate political corruption.  In stating otherwise, the Court substitutes its judgment for that of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s voters, contrary to our practice of declining to \xe2\x80\x9csecond-guess a \xe2\x80\xa6 determination as to the need for prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/197/index.html">459 U. S. 197</a>, 210 (1982).</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For this reason, the majority is quite wrong to say that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in combating corruption does not support the matching fund provision\xe2\x80\x99s application to a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure of his own money or to an independent expenditure.  <em>Ante,</em> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  The point is not that these expenditures themselves corrupt the political process.  Rather, Arizona includes these, as well as all other, expenditures in the program to ensure that participating candidates receive the funds necessary to run competitive races\xe2\x80\x94and so to attract those candidates in the first instance.  That is in direct service of the State\xe2\x80\x99s anti-corruption interest.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I note that this principle relates only to actions restricting speech.  See <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (rejecting the notion \xe2\x80\x9cthat government may restrict the speech of some \xe2\x80\xa6 to enhance the relative voice of others\xe2\x80\x9d).  As previously explained, speech subsidies stand on a different constitutional footing, see <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311; so long as the government remains neutral among viewpoints, it may choose to assist the speech of persons who might not otherwise be heard.  But here I am assuming for the sake of argument that the Clean Elections Act imposes the kind of restraint on expression requiring that the State show a compelling interest.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
