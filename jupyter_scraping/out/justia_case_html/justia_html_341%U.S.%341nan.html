CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Southern Railway Company, appellee, brought this action in the Federal District Court to enjoin the members of the Alabama Public Service Commission and the Attorney General of Alabama, appellants, from enforcing laws of Alabama prohibiting discontinuance of certain railroad passenger service.  Appellee\'s Alabama intrastate service is governed by a statute prohibiting abandonment of</p>\n<p>"any portion of its service to the public . . . unless and until there shall first have been filed an application for a permit to abandon service and obtained from the commission a permit allowing such abandonment."</p>\n<p>Ala.Code, 1940, tit. 48, \xc2\xa7 106. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Severe penalties are prescribed for willful violation of regulatory statutes or orders of the Commission by utilities or their employees.  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 399, 400, 405.</p>\n<p>Appellee operates a railroad system throughout the South. This case, however, involves only that Alabama </p><p><a class="page-number" name="343">Page 341 U. S. 343</a></p><p> intrastate passenger service furnished by trains Nos. 7 and 8 operated daily between Tuscumbia, Alabama, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, a distance of approximately 145 miles, mainly within Alabama.  On September 13, 1948, appellee applied to the Alabama Public Service Commission for permission to discontinue trains Nos. 7 and 8, alleging that public use of the service had so declined that revenues fell far short of meeting direct operating expenses.  After hearing evidence at Huntsville, Alabama, one of the communities served by the trains, the Commission entered an order on April 3, 1950, denying permission to discontinue on the grounds that there exists a public need for the service and that appellee had not attempted to reduce losses through adoption of more economical operating methods.</p>\n<p>Instead of pursuing its right of appeal to the state courts, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] appellee filed a complaint in the United States District Court alleging diversity of citizenship and that requiring continued operation of trains Nos. 7 and 8 at an out-of-pocket loss amounted to a confiscation of its property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Injunctive relief was prayed to protect appellee from irreparable loss flowing, on the one hand, from operating losses in complying with Alabama law or, on the other, from severe penalties for discontinuance of service in the face of that law.  A three-judge court [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] heard evidence, made its own findings of fact and entered judgment holding the Commission order void and permanently enjoining appellants from taking any steps to enforce either the Commission order or the penalty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 341 U. S. 344</a></p><p> provisions of the Alabama Code in relation to the discontinuance of trains Nos. 7 and 8. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]   91 F.Supp. 980 (1950).  The case is properly here on appeal, 28 U.S.C.(Supp.III) \xc2\xa7 1253.</p>\n<p>Federal jurisdiction in this case is grounded upon diversity of citizenship as well as the allegation of a federal question.  Exercise of that jurisdiction does not involve construction of a state statute so ill defined that a federal court should hold the case pending a definitive construction of that statute in the state courts, <em>e.g., Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U. S. 496</a></span> (1941); <em>Shipman v. DuPre,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/321/case.html">339 U. S. 321</a></span> (1950).  We also put to one side those cases in which the constitutionality of a state statute itself is drawn into question, <em>e.g., Toomer v. Witsell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/385/case.html">334 U. S. 385</a></span> (1948).  For, in this case, appellees attack a state administrative order issued under a valid regulatory statute designed to assure the provision of adequate intrastate service by utilities operating within Alabama. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellee takes the position, adopted by the court below, that, whenever a plaintiff can show irreparable loss caused </p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 341 U. S. 345</a></p><p> by an allegedly invalid state administrative order ripe for judicial review in the state courts the presence of diversity of citizenship or a federal question opens the federal courts to litigation as to the validity of that order, at least so long as no action involving the same subject matter is actually pending in the state courts.  But it by no means follows from the fact of district court jurisdiction that such jurisdiction must be exercised in this case. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As framed by the Court in <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/315/case.html">319 U. S. 315</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/315/case.html#318">319 U. S. 318</a></span> (1943), the question before us is:</p>\n<p>"Assuming that the federal district court had jurisdiction, should it, as a matter of sound equitable discretion, have declined to exercise that jurisdiction here?"</p>\n<p>In assessing the propriety of equitable relief, a review of the regulatory problem involved in this case is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Appellee conducts an interstate business over the same tracks and by means of the same trains involved in this case, and such interstate activities are regulated by the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1 <em>et seq.</em>  But it has long been held that this interblending of the interstate and intrastate operations does not deprive the states of their primary authority over intrastate transportation in the absence of congressional action supplementing that authority.  <em>Minnesota Rate Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/230/352/case.html">230 U. S. 352</a></span> (1913).  And Congress has since provided:</p>\n<p>"That nothing in [the Interstate Commerce Act] shall impair or affect the right of a State, in the exercise of its police power, to require just and reasonable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 341 U. S. 346</a></p><p> freight and passenger service for intrastate business, except insofar as such requirement is inconsistent with any lawful order of the [Interstate Commerce Commission]."</p>\n<p>49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1(17)(a). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court has held that regulation of intrastate railroad service is "primarily the concern of the State."  <em>North Carolina v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/507/case.html">325 U. S. 507</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/507/case.html#511">325 U. S. 511</a></span> (1945) (rates); <em>Palmer v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/79/case.html">308 U. S. 79</a></span> (1939) (discontinuance of local service).</p>\n<p>State and federal regulatory agencies have expressed concern over the chronic deficit arising out of passenger train operations as a threat to the financial security of the American railroads, and have recommended drastic action to minimize the deficit, including the discontinuance of unpatronized and unprofitable service. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  However, our concern in this case is limited to the propriety of a federal court injunction enjoining enforcement of a state regulatory order. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The court below justified the exercise of its jurisdiction with a finding that continued operation of trains Nos. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 341 U. S. 347</a></p><p> 7 and 8 would result in confiscation of appellee\'s property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In pursuing the threshold inquiry whether a federal court should exercise jurisdiction in this case, we find it unnecessary to consider issues relating to the merits of appellee\'s case, issues which appellants did not see fit to raise in this Court either in their Statement of Jurisdiction or in their briefs.  We do note that, in passing upon similar contentions in the past, this Court has recognized that review of an order requiring performance of a particular utility service, even at a pecuniary loss, is subject to considerations quite different from those involved when the return on the entire intrastate operations of a utility is drawn into question.  <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/1/case.html">206 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/1/case.html#24">206 U. S. 24</a></span>-27.  The problems raised by the discontinuance of trains Nos. 7 and 8 cannot be resolved alone by reference to appellee\'s loss in their operation, but depend more upon the predominantly local factor of public need for the service rendered.  <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/242/603/case.html">242 U. S. 603</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/242/603/case.html#608">242 U. S. 608</a></span> (1917).</p>\n<p>The Alabama Commission, after a hearing held in the area served, found a public need for the service.  The court below, hearing evidence <em>de novo,</em> found that no public necessity exists in view of the increased use and availability of motor transportation.  We do not attempt to resolve these inconsistent findings of fact.  We take note, however, of the fact that a federal court has been asked to intervene in resolving the essentially local problem of balancing the loss to the railroad from continued operation of trains Nos. 7 and 8 with the public need </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 341 U. S. 348</a></p><p> for that service in Tuscumbia, Decatur, Huntsville, Scottsboro, and the other Alabama communities directly affected.</p>\n<p>Not only has Alabama established its Public Service Commission to pass upon a proposed discontinuance of intrastate transportation service, but it has also provided for appeal from any final order of the Commission to the circuit court of Montgomery County as a matter of right.  Ala.Code 1940, Tit. 48, \xc2\xa7 79.  That court, after a hearing on the record certified by the Commission, is empowered to set aside any Commission order found to be contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa7 82, and its decision may be appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court.  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xa7 90.  Statutory appeal from an order of the Commission is an integral part of the regulatory process under the Alabama Code.  Appeals, concentrated in one circuit court, are "supervisory in character."  <em>Avery Freight Lines, Inc. v. White,</em> 245 Ala. 618, 622-623, 18 So.2d 394, 398.  The Supreme Court of Alabama has held that it will review an order of the Commission as if appealed directly to it, <em>Alabama Public Service Commission v. Nunis,</em> 252 Ala. 30, 34, 39 So.2d 409, 412 (1949), and that judicial review calls for an independent judgment as to both law and facts when a denial of due process is asserted.  <em>Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Co.,</em> 253 Ala. 1, 11-12, 42 So.2d 655, 662 (1949).</p>\n<p>The fact that review in the Alabama courts is limited to the record taken before the Commission presents no constitutional infirmity.  <em>Washington ex rel. Oregon R. and N. Co. v. Fairchild,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/510/case.html">224 U. S. 510</a></span> (1912).  And, whatever the scope of review of Commission findings when an alleged denial of constitutional rights is in issue, it is now settled that a utility has no right to relitigate factual questions on the ground that constitutional rights are involved.  <em>New York v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/284/case.html">331 U. S. 284</a></span> (1947).; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 341 U.

Appellee complains of irreparable injury resulting from the Commission order pending judicial review, but has not invoked the protective powers of the Alabama courts to direct the stay or supersedeas of a Commission order pending appeal.  Ala.Code 1940, Tit. 48, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 81, 84. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Appellee has not shown that the Alabama procedure for review of Commission orders is in any way inadequate to preserve for ultimate review in this Court any federal questions arising out of such orders.</p>\n<p>As adequate state court review of an administrative order based upon predominantly local factors is available to appellee, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] intervention of a federal court is not necessary for the protection of federal rights.  Equitable relief may be granted only when the District Court, in its sound discretion exercised with the "scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts," [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] is convinced </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 341 U. S. 350</a></p><p> that the asserted federal right cannot be preserved except by granting the "extraordinary relief of an injunction in the federal courts." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Considering that</p>\n<p>"[f]ew public interests have a higher claim upon the discretion of a federal chancellor than the avoidance of needless friction with state policies, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]"</p>\n<p>the usual rule of comity must govern the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by the District Court in this case.

JUSTICE JACKSON joins, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>The Southern Railway asked leave of the Alabama Public Service Commission to take off two of its passenger trains.  The Commission, deeming the service of these runs necessary for the communities served, denied leave.  The Railway thereafter applied to the United States District Court for an injunction against the order of the Commission.  The bill asking for this injunction was based on a claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The allegations of the bill and the proof under it failed to establish a substantial claim under the United States Constitution.  Under familiar, well established principles, the District Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 341 U. S. 352</a></p><p> should have dismissed the bill.  The Court likewise directs the District Court to dismiss the bill.  But it chooses to do so by a line of argument in plain disregard of congressional legislation.  Against that I am compelled to protest.</p>\n<p>Alabama has the conventional feature of railroad regulatory legislation requiring leave of the State Public Service Commission for the discontinuance of trains.  Ala.Code 1940, tit. 48, \xc2\xa7 106.  The Southern Railway Company asked permission to discontinue the two trains on the ground that, as segregated items of its total business in Alabama, these trains were operating at a substantial loss.  The Commission refused permission after a full hearing, and no question of procedural due process is before us.</p>\n<p>Southern brought its suit to restrain enforcement of the Commission order in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.  The case was heard by a three-judge court, as required by 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281, and a permanent injunction was granted.  A direct appeal to this Court lies from such a decision.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253.</p>\n<p>In holding that the order of the State Commission violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court relied chiefly upon the fact that the operation of the two trains involved a substantial loss.  It has long been settled, however, that a requirement that a particular service be rendered at a loss does not make such a service confiscatory, and thereby an unconstitutional taking of property.  <em>St. Louis &amp; S.F.

S. 396</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the trains involved, Nos. 7 and 8, are local passenger trains operated between Sheffield-Tuscumbia, Alabama, and Chattanooga.  Southern operates four other trains between these points. Nos. 45 and 46 do not stop at all stations, and operate on a schedule </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 341 U. S. 354</a></p><p> inconvenient to the public here concerned.  The State Commission found that the schedules of Nos. 35 and 36 "are not comparable to" those of Trains 7 and 8, and do not afford the same convenience.</p>\n<p>It appears that the operation of Trains 7 and 8 resulted in a loss of $8,527.24 per month during the twelve-month period ending February 28, 1949.  During the five-month period ending July 31, 1949, the loss amounted to $10,738.51 per month.  But the railroad made no claim that it is operating at a loss, or failing to receive a fair return, either on its total investment or upon its investment within the Alabama.  The record contains only the sketchiest findings concerning the operation of the railroad in its entirety.  But it does appear that, although Southern has operated its passenger business at a loss aside from the war years, it has earned a substantial net operating income upon both its entire business and its service within the Alabama. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  This litigation seems to have been concerned almost exclusively with the operations of Trains 7 and 8.  No showing whatever was made that, by the loss incurred in running these trains Southern was deprived of that protection for its investment in Alabama which alone can be made the basis of a claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 341 U. S. 355</a></p><p> Amendment.  The lack of merit in the plaintiff\'s case is so clear that it calls for dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p>Instead, as we have stated, this Court rests its decision on a ground that requires it to overturn a long course of decisions and, in effect, to repeal an act of Congress defining the jurisdiction of the district courts.  It is undisputed that the plaintiff is asserting a claim under the Federal Constitution.  The Court admits that the District Court has jurisdiction of the suit.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1331, 1332.  It is said, however, that the District Court must decline to exercise this jurisdiction because judicial review of the order could have been had in the State courts.</p>\n<p>In 1875, Congress for the first time (barring the abortive Act of 1801) opened the federal courts to claims based on a right under the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Theretofore, such claims had to be pursued in the State courts and brought to this Court for review of the federal question under \xc2\xa7 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 85.  In <em>Reagan v. Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/362/case.html">154 U.

The Court has consistently held to the view that it cannot overrule the determination of Congress as to whether federal courts should be allowed jurisdiction, concurrent with the State courts, even where the plaintiff seeks to restrain action of a State agency.  <em>Smyth v.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Since the body of decisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 341 U. S. 357</a></p><p> which hold the contrary is thus to be discarded, they ought not to be left as derelicts on the waters of the law.</p>\n<p>In Congress, a prolonged debate has ensued over the wisdom of the broad grants of power made to the federal courts of original jurisdiction -- power which may be invoked against State regulation of economic enterprise.  Bill after bill has been proposed to prevent the lower federal courts from interfering with such State action.  Finally, in 1910, by a provision in the Mann-Elkins Act, Congress provided that an action for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the action of a State officer acting under a statute alleged to violate the Federal Constitution be heard by a court of three judges, with a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court.  Act of June 18, 1910, \xc2\xa7 17, 36 Stat. 539, 557.  In 1913, this procedure was extended to applications for an interlocutory injunction to restrain enforcement of the order of a State board or commission.  Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013.  By the same statute, a State was empowered to keep litigation concerning the validity of State agency regulation in its own courts if it was willing to stay the administrative order. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  In 1925, the provision for a three-judge court and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 341 U. S. 358</a></p><p> direct appeal was extended to a permanent injunction.  Act of Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, \xc2\xa7 1, 43 Stat. 936, 938.</p>\n<p>Congress, fully aware of the problem, was still not satisfied with the jurisdiction it had left to the federal district courts.  Accordingly, in 1934, it passed the Johnson Act, which withdrew their jurisdiction over suits to enjoin the enforcement of State rate orders, providing that a remedy was available in the State courts.  Act of May 14, 1934, 48 Stat. 775.  This restriction on a district court is not here applicable, for the order in controversy is not a rate order.  In 1937, Congress further limited federal jurisdiction by providing that a district court could not enjoin enforcement of a State tax statute where a remedy was available in the State courts.  Act of Aug. 21, 1937, 50 Stat. 738.</p>\n<p>Plainly we are concerned with a jurisdictional issue which has been continuously before Congress and with which it has dealt by explicit and detailed legislation.  Congress first made a broad grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts as to all constitutional and other federal claims.  Experience gave rise to dissatisfaction with this grant and Congress began to hedge and limit the power.  It required that the case be heard by three judges, that a speedy appeal be available, and that the State courts could have exclusive jurisdiction if they would stay the administrative order.  It withdrew jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of State statutes and orders in the two fields where the greatest dissatisfaction with federal jurisdiction existed -- rate orders and taxation -- so long as a State remedy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 341 U. S. 359</a></p><p> was available.  But Congress did not take away the power of the district court to decide a case like the one before us.  Instead, it recognized by the wording of \xc2\xa7 17 of the Mann-Elkins Act and later legislation that it had given a right to resort to the federal courts and that such power was an obligatory jurisdiction, not to be denied because as a matter of policy it might be more desirable to raise such constitutional claims in a State court.</p>\n<p>The Court rejects the guidance of these amendatory acts, all placing specific limitations upon the exercise of district court jurisdiction in cases affecting local regulation.  Instead, the Court now limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts as though Congress had amended \xc2\xa7 1331 of Title 28 to read:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, <em>provided that the district courts shall not exercise this jurisdiction where a suit involves a challenge to an order of a state regulatory commission.</em>"</p>\n<p>(New matter in italics.)</p>\n<p>It does not change the significance of the Court\'s decision to coat it with the sugar of equity maxims.  As we have seen, there is no warrant in the decisions of this Court for saying that the plaintiff has an "adequate remedy at law" merely because he may bring suit in the State courts.  An "adequate remedy at law," as a bar to equitable relief in the federal courts, refers to a remedy on the law side of federal courts.  <em>Petroleum Exploration, Inc. v.

An equity court, in the exercise of its broad powers, may also decline to give relief if there are special circumstances which make it desirable for the court to stay its hand or decline to interfere.  Thus, traditionally, an equity court will be reluctant to interfere with the administration of criminal justice.  <em>Beal v. Missouri Pacific R.

S. 332</a></span> <em>et seq.</em>  In that case, the majority found that the technicalities of oil regulation and the importance of competent, uniform review made it proper for the District Court to decline to exercise its equity jurisdiction.  Again, an equity court, like a court of law for that matter, ought not to hear a case before the plaintiff has exhausted all available nonjudicial legal remedies.  <em>Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p>Here, the plaintiff has exhausted its nonjudicial remedies.  <em>Avery Freight Lines, Inc. v. Persons,</em> 250 Ala. 40, 32 So.2d 886 (1947).  Concededly there is no state statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 341 U. S. 361</a></p><p> to construe.  There is no consideration which should make a court of equity, as a matter of discretion, decline to entertain a bill for an injunction.  Nor does the situation in this suit involve a specialized field of State law in which out-of-State federal judges are not at home.  On the contrary, the claim that is made here is within the easy grasp of federal judges, and certainly within the competence of three judges bred in Alabama law, with wide experience in its administration.  The only reason for declining to entertain the suit is that it may well be more desirable as a matter of State-Federal relations for the order of a State agency to be reviewed originally in the State lower court, and not to be challenged in the first instance in a federal court.  It is not for me to quarrel with the wisdom of such a policy.  But Congress, in the constitutional exercise of its power to define the jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts, has decided otherwise.</p>\n<p>Equity, by its very nature, denies relief if, on balance of considerations of convenience relevant to equity, it would be inequitable to grant the extraordinary remedy of an injunction.  Federal courts of equity have always acted on this equitable doctrine.  But it was never a doctrine of equity that a federal court should exercise its judicial discretion to dismiss a suit merely because a State court could entertain it.</p>\n<p>This is so because discretion based solely on the availability of a remedy in the State courts would, for all practical purposes, repeal the Act of 1875.  This Act gave to the federal courts a jurisdiction not theretofore possessed, so that a State could not tie up a litigant making such a claim by requiring that the bring suit for redress in its own courts.  That jurisdiction was precisely the jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenge to local action on the basis of the vast limitations placed upon State action by the Civil War amendments.  And precisely because of objections to the choice of courts given plaintiffs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 341 U. S. 362</a></p><p> by the Act of 1875, Congress, by piecemeal restrictive legislation, did require that some federal claims against local regulatory action be litigated originally in state courts, and from there brought here for review.</p>\n<p>By one fell swoop, the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless legislation in the Acts of 1910, 1913, 1925, 1934, and 1937.  By these measures, Congress, so the Court now decides, gave not only needless, but inadequate, relief, since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the Act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging local regulation.  For, if this decision means anything beyond disposing of this particular litigation, it means that, hereafter, no federal court should entertain a suit against any action of a state agency.  For every State must afford judicial review in its courts of a claim under the Due Process Clause if such claim would give a federal court jurisdiction.  In the absence of such judicial review in the state courts, state action under the doctrine of <em>Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Borough of Ben Avon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/287/case.html">253 U. S. 287</a></span>, would be nugatory because unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>I regret my inability to make clear to the majority of this Court that its opinion is in flagrant contradiction with the unbroken course of decisions in this Court for seventy-five years.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The record contains no allegations or findings on the value of the railroad\'s property and no particulars concerning its accounting system.
