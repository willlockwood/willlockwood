Three decisions, <em>Clark, In\xc2\xa0re Robbins</em>, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d 311, and <em>In\xc2\xa0re Gallego</em>, 18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d 290, describe California\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness requirement.  A prisoner must seek habeas relief without \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial delay,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., Robbins</em>, 18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 317, as \xe2\x80\x9cmeasured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasonably should have known, of the information offered in support of the claim and the legal basis of the claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 787, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 322.  All California courts have \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, \xc2\xa710.  Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Supreme Court, that court rules on a staggering number of habeas petitions each year.  A summary denial citing <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em> means that the petition is rejected as untimely.  California courts, however, have discretion to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily reject the petition for want of merit.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Martin was convicted of murder and robbery, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  After the California Supreme Court denied Martin\xe2\x80\x99s first state habeas petition, he filed a federal habeas petition.  The District Court ordered a stay to permit Martin to return to state court to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims he had not previously aired.  Martin raised those claims in his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court, but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final.  The California Supreme Court denied the petition, citing <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em>.  Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Martin filed an amended federal habeas petition.  The District Court dismissed his belatedly asserted claims as untimely under California law.  The Ninth Circuit vacated that order and directed the District Court to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cadequacy\xe2\x80\x9d of the State\xe2\x80\x99s time bar.  Again rejecting Martin\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the District Court found California\xe2\x80\x99s bar an adequate state ground for denying Martin\xe2\x80\x99s new pleas.  Concluding that the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied, the Ninth Circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>California\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness requirement qualifies as an independent state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court.

S. ___, ___.  California\xe2\x80\x99s time rule, although discretionary, meets this \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly established\xe2\x80\x9d criterion.  The California Supreme Court framed the requirement in a trilogy of cases, instructing habeas petitioners to \xe2\x80\x9calleg[e] with specificity\xe2\x80\x9d the absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to the time bar.  <em>Gallego</em>, 18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 299.  And California\xe2\x80\x99s case law made it plain that Martin\xe2\x80\x99s nearly five-year delay was \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 829\xe2\x80\x93831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 293\xe2\x80\x93294, 299, and n.\xc2\xa013.  The Court finds unpersuasive Martin\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the terms \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d period and \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial delay\xe2\x80\x9d make California\xe2\x80\x99s rule too vague to be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly established.\xe2\x80\x9d  While indeterminate language is typical of discretionary rules, application of those rules in particular circumstances can supply the requisite clarity.  Congressional statutes and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have employed time limitations that are not stated in precise, numerical terms.  For example, current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one year.  The clock runs from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the [supporting] facts \xe2\x80\xa6 could have been discovered through \xe2\x80\xa6 due diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255(f)(4).  Although \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98due diligence\xe2\x80\x99 is an inexact measure of how much delay is too much,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/295/index.html">544 U. S. 295</a>, 309, n. 7, \xe2\x80\x9cuse of an imprecise standard is no justification for depriving [a rule\xe2\x80\x99s] language of any meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Nor is California\xe2\x80\x99s time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.  Each year, the California State Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em>.  Contrary to Martin\xe2\x80\x99s argument, California\xe2\x80\x99s time bar is not infirm simply because a court may opt to bypass the <em>Clark</em>/<em>Robbins</em> assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.  Nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case.  Discretion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an unyielding rule.  A state ground may be found inadequate when a court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner, but Martin makes no such contention here.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This decision leaves unaltered the Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated recognition that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural requirements to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against claims of federal rights.  See, <em>e.g., Brown</em> v. <em>Western R. Co. of Ala.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/294/index.html">338 U. S. 294</a>, 298\xe2\x80\x93299.  On the record here, however, there is no basis for concluding that California\xe2\x80\x99s rule operates in such a discriminatory manner.  P.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p align="left">357 Fed.

The question presented: Does California\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness requirement qualify as an independent state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to determine the timeliness of a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s petition for habeas corpus.  Instead, California directs petitioners to file known claims \xe2\x80\x9cas promptly as the circumstances allow.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Clark</em>, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n.\xc2\xa05, 855 P.\xc2\xa02d 729, 738, n.\xc2\xa05 (1993).  Petitioners are further instructed to state when they first learned of the asserted claims and to explain why they did not seek postconviction relief sooner.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Robbins</em>, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d 311, 317\xe2\x80\x93318 (1998).  Claims substantially delayed without justification may be denied as untimely.  <em>Ibid.</em>; <em>Clark</em>, 5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 738, n.\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied as untimely by citing the controlling decisions, <em>i.e.</em>, <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em>.  A spare order denying a petition without explanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on the merits.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see <em>Harrington</em> v. <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  California courts may elect to pretermit the question whether a petition is timely and simply deny the petition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin, presented the claims at issue\xe2\x80\x94all alleging ineffective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x94in a habeas petition filed in the California Supreme Court nearly five years after his conviction became final.  He stated no reason for the long delay.  Citing <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em>, the court denied Martin\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  In turn, the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of California dismissed Martin\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance claims.  Denial of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s state-court petition as untimely, the District Court held, rested on an adequate and independent state ground, <em>i.e.</em>, Martin\xe2\x80\x99s failure to seek relief in state court \xe2\x80\x9cwithout substantial delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Robbins</em>, 18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U.

Contrasting the precision of \xe2\x80\x9cfixed statutory deadlines\xe2\x80\x9d with California\xe2\x80\x99s proscription of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial delay,\xe2\x80\x9d the appeals court held that California\xe2\x80\x99s standard lacked the clarity and certainty necessary to constitute an adequate state bar.  357 Fed. Appx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Knowles</em>, 562 F.\xc2\xa03d 1200 (CA9 2009)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a recent decision, <em>Beard</em> v. <em>Kindler</em>, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.  Guided by that decision, we hold that California is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions (which would almost certainly rule out Martin\xe2\x80\x99s nearly five-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current practice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 7).  In so ruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that California\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, either by design or in operation, discriminates against federal claims or claimants.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor rule of court does so.

We disagree.  Indeterminate language is typical of discretionary rules.  Application of those rules in particular circumstances, however, can supply the requisite clarity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congressional statutes and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, we note, have employed time limitations that are not stated in precise, numerical terms.  Former Federal Habeas Corpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on submission of habeas petitions.  The Rule permitted dismissal of a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s petition when it appeared that delay in commencing litigation \xe2\x80\x9cprejudiced [the State] in its ability to respond.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 Rule 9(a) (1994 ed.).  To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show that he could not earlier have known, \xe2\x80\x9cby the exercise of reasonable diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d the grounds on which he based the petition.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/269/index.html">544 U.

Each year, the California Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing <em>Clark</em> and <em>Robbins</em>.  Brief for Appellant in No. 08\xe2\x80\x9315752 (CA9), pp. 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  On the same day the court denied Martin\xe2\x80\x99s petition, it issued 21 other <em>Clark</em>/<em>Robbins </em>summary denials.  See Brief for Habeas Corpus Resource Center as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 20.  In reasoned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke <em>Clark</em>, <em>Robbins</em>, and <em>Gallego</em> to determine whether a habeas petition is time barred.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Martin argued below that California\xe2\x80\x99s time bar is not regularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials makes it \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to tell\xe2\x80\x9d why the California Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cdecides some delayed petitions on the merits and rejects others as untimely.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant in No. 08\xe2\x80\x9315752 (CA9), pp. 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  We see no reason to reject California\xe2\x80\x99s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the <em>Clark</em>/<em>Robbins</em> assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 697 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] court need not determine whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient \xe2\x80\xa6 [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U.

See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794.  For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fairbanks</em>, No. C047810, 2006 WL 950267, *2\xe2\x80\x93*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year delay was found substantial, while in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Little</em>, No. D047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n.\xc2\xa06 (Cal.

See <em>Prihoda </em>v. <em>McCaughtry</em>, 910 F.\xc2\xa02d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cUncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state\xe2\x80\x99s\nprocedural ground as one \xe2\x80\x98adequate\xe2\x80\x99 under federal law.
