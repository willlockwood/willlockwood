For the affidavits on their face gave reason to believe that petitioner\'s gambling activities were in violation of local law,2 and gave no reason to believe that petitioner would waive his right not to incriminate himself of such violations. I may assume that the Government, in showing probable cause to support a search warrant, need not negative any conceivable defense that might be raised by suspect. Cf. United States v. Ventresca, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/102/case.html">380 U.S. 102</a>, 107-109, 85 S.Ct. 741d 684 (1965). But where, as here, the affidavits in support of the warrant indicate the likely existence of an absolute defense to the crime charged that will be unavailing only if explicitly waived by the accused, it is surely not evident that the Fourth Amendment\'s requirement of probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed is satisfied. I would grant certiorari and set the case for argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> The Government does not dispute that petitioner\'s gambling activities were illegal under state law, and points to nothing in the record that would indicate petitioner would intelligently and knowingly waive his right against self-incrimination. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Indeed, the affidavits and the District Court relied upon petitioner\'s past arrests on gambling charges to support the finding of probable cause. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
