S. 584</a> (2002), applies retroactively to cases already final on direct review.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlin\xe2\x80\x99s wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Summerlin</em>, 138 Ariz. 426, 675 P.\xc2\xa02d 686 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Protracted state and federal habeas proceedings followed.  While respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case was pending in the Ninth Circuit, we decided <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and <em>Ring</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <em>supra</em>.  In <em>Apprendi</em>, we interpreted the constitutional due-process and jury-trial guarantees to require that, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 490.  In <em>Ring</em>, we applied this principle to a death sentence imposed under the Arizona sentencing scheme at issue here.  We concluded that, because Arizona law authorized the death penalty only if an aggravating factor was present, <em>Apprendi</em> required the existence of such a factor to be proved to a jury rather than to a judge.  536 U. S., at 603\xe2\x80\x93609.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We specifically overruled our earlier decision in <em>Walton</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/639/index.html">497 U.

We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1045/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/1045/index.html">540 U. S. 1045</a> (2003).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When a decision of this Court results in a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule,\xe2\x80\x9d that rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review.  <em>Griffith</em> v. <em>Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, 328 (1987).  As to convictions that are already final, however, the rule applies only in limited circumstances.  New <em>substantive </em>rules generally apply retroactively.  This includes decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms, see <em>Bousley</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/614/index.html">523 U. S. 614</a>, 620\xe2\x80\x93621 (1998), as well as constitutional determinations that place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to punish, see <em>Saffle</em> v. <em>Parks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/index.html">494 U. S. 484</a>, 494\xe2\x80\x93495 (1990); <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a>, 311 (1989) (plurality opinion).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Such rules apply retroactively because they \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of \xe2\x80\x98an act that the law does not make criminal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.  <em>Bousley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 620 (quoting <em>Davis</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/333/index.html">417 U. S. 333</a>, 346 (1974)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New rules of procedure, on the other hand, generally do not apply retroactively.  They do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal, but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise.  Because of this more speculative connection to innocence, we give retroactive effect to only a small set of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98watershed rules of criminal procedure\xe2\x80\x99 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saffle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495 (quoting <em>Teague</em>, 489 U. S., at 311).  That a new procedural rule is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one \xe2\x80\x9cwithout which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is <em>seriously </em>diminished.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 313 (emphasis added).  This class of rules is extremely narrow, and \xe2\x80\x9cit is unlikely that any \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98ha[s] yet to emerge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tyler</em> v. <em>Cain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/656/index.html">533 U.

S. 227</a>, 243 (1990)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit agreed with the State that <em>Ring</em> announced a new rule.  341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1108\xe2\x80\x931109.  It nevertheless applied the rule retroactively to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case, relying on two alternative theories: first, that it was substantive rather than procedural; and second, that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d procedural rule entitled to retroactive effect.  We consider each theory in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.  See <em>Bousley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 620\xe2\x80\x93621 (rule \xe2\x80\x9chold[s] that a \xe2\x80\xa6 statute does not reach certain conduct\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] conduct criminal\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Saffle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495 (rule \xe2\x80\x9cdecriminalize[s] a class of conduct [or] prohibit[s] the imposition of \xe2\x80\xa6 punishment on a particular class of persons\xe2\x80\x9d).  In contrast, rules that regulate only the <em>manner of determining</em> the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability are procedural.  See <em>Bousley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 620.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judged by this standard, <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding is properly classified as procedural.  <em>Ring </em>held that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 609.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Sixth Amendment requires that [those circumstances] be found by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjected to the death penalty.  It could not have; it rested entirely on the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize.  Instead, <em>Ring</em> altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment.  Rules that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached in numerous other contexts.  See <em>Gasperini</em> v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/415/index.html">518 U. S. 415</a>, 426 (1996) (<em>Erie</em> doctrine); <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a>, 280\xe2\x80\x93281 (1994) (antiretroactivity presumption); <em>Dobbert</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/282/index.html">432 U. S. 282</a>, 293\xe2\x80\x93294 (1977) (<em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent nevertheless argues that <em>Ring </em>is substantive because it modified the elements of the offense for which he was convicted.  He relies on our statement in <em>Ring </em>that, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated aggravating factors operate as \xe2\x80\x98the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\xe2\x80\x99 the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 609 (citation omitted); see also <em>Sattazahn</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/101/index.html">537 U. S. 101</a>, 111 (2003) (plurality opinion).  The Ninth Circuit agreed, concluding that <em>Ring </em>\xe2\x80\x9creposition[ed] Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s aggravating factors as elements of the separate offense of capital murder and reshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law.\xe2\x80\x9d  341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See <em>Bousley</em>, 523 U. S., at 620\xe2\x80\x93621.  But that is not what <em>Ring </em>did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before <em>Ring </em>as after.  <em>Ring</em> held that, <em>because </em>Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators <em>effectively were </em>elements for federal constitutional purposes, and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements.  536 U. S., at 609.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that, <em>because Arizona</em> has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as <em>this Court\xe2\x80\x99s</em> making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>Ring</em> nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9creshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law,\xe2\x80\x9d 341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105, is particularly remarkable in the face of the Arizona Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous conclusion to the contrary.  See <em>State </em>v. <em>Towery</em>, 204 Ariz. 386, 390\xe2\x80\x93391, 64 P.\xc2\xa03d 828, 832\xe2\x80\x93833, cert. dism\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/986/index.html">539 U. S. 986</a> (2003).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues in the alternative that <em>Ring </em>falls under the retroactivity exception for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98watershed rules of criminal procedure\xe2\x80\x99 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saffle</em>, 494 U. S., at 495 (quoting <em>Teague</em>, 489 U. S., at 311).  He offers several reasons why juries are more accurate factfinders, including the tendency of group deliberation to suppress individual eccentricities; the jury\xe2\x80\x99s protection from exposure to inadmissible evidence; and its better representation of the common sense of the community.  The Ninth Circuit majority added others, including the claim that a judge might be too acclimated to capital sentencing and that he might be swayed by political pressure.  341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1109\xe2\x80\x931116.  Respondent further notes that common-law authorities praised the jury\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding ability.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 380 (1768); <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Brailsford,</em> 3 Dall. 1, 4 (1794) (jury charge of Jay, C. J.).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question here is not, however, whether the Framers believed that juries are more accurate factfinders than judges (perhaps so\xe2\x80\x94they certainly thought juries were more independent, see <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, <em>ante</em>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9312)).  Nor is the question whether juries actually <em>are </em>more accurate factfinders than judges (again, perhaps so).  Rather, the question is whether judicial factfinding so \xe2\x80\x9c<em>seriously </em>diminishe[s]\xe2\x80\x9d accuracy that there is an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impermissibly large risk\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of punishing conduct the law does not reach.  <em>Teague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 312\xe2\x80\x93313 (quoting <em>Desist</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/index.html">394 U. S. 244</a>, 262 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting)) (emphasis added).  The evidence is simply too equivocal to support that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, for every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.  The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to become confused over legal standards and to be influenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition. <em> </em>341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1129\xe2\x80\x931131 (opinion of Rawlinson, J.) (citing, <em>inter alia</em>, Eisenberg &amp; Wells, Deadly Confusion: Juror Instructions in Capital Cases, 79 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1 (1993); Garvey, The Emotional Economy of Capital Sentencing, 75 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U.

Members of this Court have opined that judicial sentencing may yield more consistent results because of judges\xe2\x80\x99 greater experience.  See <em>Proffitt</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/242/index.html">428 U. S. 242</a>, 252 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  Finally, the mixed reception that the right to jury trial has been given in other countries, see Vidmar, The Jury Elsewhere in the World, in World Jury Systems 421\xe2\x80\x93447 (N. Vidmar ed. 2000), though irrelevant to the meaning and continued existence of that right under our Constitution, surely makes it implausible that judicial factfinding so \xe2\x80\x9c<em>seriously </em>diminishe[s]\xe2\x80\x9d accuracy as to produce an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impermissibly large risk\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of injustice.  When so many presumably reasonable minds continue to disagree over whether juries are better factfinders <em>at all</em>, we cannot confidently say that judicial factfinding <em>seriously</em> diminishes accuracy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>DeStefano</em> v. <em>Woods,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/631/index.html">392 U.

S. 145</a> (1968), which applied the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee to the States.  While <em>DeStefano</em> was decided under our pre-<em>Teague</em> retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98[w]e would not assert \xe2\x80\xa6 that every criminal trial\xe2\x80\x94or any particular trial\xe2\x80\x94held before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 633\xe2\x80\x93634 (quoting <em>Duncan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 158).  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he values implemented by the right to jury trial would not measurably be served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the past by procedures not consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 634.  If under <em>DeStefano</em> a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a judge finds only aggravating factors could be.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  <em>Post</em>, at 4 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But the statute here does not condition death eligibility on whether the offense is heinous, cruel, or depraved <em>as determined by community standards</em>.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statute\xe2\x80\x99s substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, \xe2\x80\x9cdramatically different,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6).  Much of this analysis is not an application of <em>Teague</em>, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavor to \xe2\x80\x9cbalance competing considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4.  Even were we inclined to revisit <em>Teague</em> in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in <em>DeStefano</em>, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after <em>Teague.</em>  See <em>post</em>, at 8.  But we held in that case that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]ll three</em> factors favor only prospective application of the rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 633 (emphasis added).  Thus, the result would have been the same even if enhanced accuracy were the sole criterion for retroactivity.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to jury trial is fundamental to our system of criminal procedure, and States are bound to enforce the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantees as we interpret them.  But it does not follow that, when a criminal defendant has had a full trial and one round of appeals in which the State faithfully applied the Constitution as we understood it at the time, he may nevertheless continue to litigate his claims indefinitely in hopes that we will one day have a change of heart.  <em>Ring</em> announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.

The majority held only that the jury must decide whether the special aggravating factors that make the offender <em>eligible</em> for death are present.  536 U. S., at 603\xe2\x80\x93609.  And it rested its decision that a jury, not a judge, must make that determination upon the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment holding in <em>Apprendi</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d 530 U. S., at 490.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the majority says that <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Apprendi</em>-related rule cannot satisfy <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy-enhancing requirement, for two reasons.  First, it points out that for \xe2\x80\x9cevery argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Hence, one cannot say \xe2\x80\x9cconfidently\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial factfinding <em>seriously </em>diminishes accuracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (emphasis in original).  Second, it relies on <em>DeStefano</em> v. <em>Woods</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/631/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/631/index.html">392 U. S. 631</a> (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em>, the case in which<em> </em>this Court considered whether <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <em>supra</em>, which extended the Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee to the States, should apply retroactively.  The Court decided that <em>Duncan</em> should <em>not </em>have retroactive effect.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority concludes, \xe2\x80\x9ca trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a judge finds only aggravating factors could be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, overlooks three additional considerations that lead me to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, the factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s role in determining the applicability of aggravating factors in a death case is a special role that can involve, not simply the finding of brute facts, but also the making of death-related, community-based value judgments.  The leading single aggravator charged in Arizona, for example, requires the factfinder to decide whether the crime was committed in an \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(F)(6) (West Supp. 2003); see Office of Attorney General, State of Arizona, Capital Case Commission Final Report (2002).  Three of the other four <em>Ring</em>-affected States use a similar aggravator.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x931.3\xe2\x80\x931201(5)(j) (2003); Idaho Code \xc2\xa719\xe2\x80\x932515(h)(5) (Supp. 2003); Neb. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa729\xe2\x80\x932523(1)(d) (1995).  Words like \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccruel,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdepraved\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94particularly when asked in the context of a death sentence proceeding\xe2\x80\x94require reference to community-based standards, standards that incorporate values.  (Indeed, Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s standard explicitly asks the factfinder to assess the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in light of \xe2\x80\x9cordinary standards of morality and intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.)  A jury is better equipped than a judge to identify and to apply those standards accurately.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, <em>Teague\xe2\x80\x99</em>s basic purpose strongly favors retroactive application of <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity principles reflect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s effort to balance competing  considerations.  See 489 U. S., at 309\xe2\x80\x93313;<em> Mackey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/index.html">401 U.

S. 244</a>, 256 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  On the one hand, interests related to certain of the Great Writ\xe2\x80\x99s basic objectives\xe2\x80\x94protecting the innocent against erroneous conviction or punishment and assuring fundamentally fair procedures\xe2\x80\x94favor applying a new procedural rule retroactively.  <em>Teague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 312\xe2\x80\x93313; <em>Mackey</em>, 401 U. S., at 693\xe2\x80\x93694.  So too does the legal system\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to \xe2\x80\x9cequal justice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, to \xe2\x80\x9cassur[ing] a uniformity of ultimate treatment among prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 689.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where death-sentence-related factfinding is at issue, these considerations have unusually strong force.

S. 333</a>, 342 (1993).  Hence, the risk of error that the law can tolerate is correspondingly diminished.  At the same time, the \xe2\x80\x9cqualitative difference of death from all other punishments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, its severity and irrevocability\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crequires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination\xe2\x80\x9d than of other criminal judgments.  <em>California</em> v. <em>Ramos</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/992/index.html">463 U.

Outside the capital sentencing context, one might understand the nature of the difference that the word \xe2\x80\x9cfinality\xe2\x80\x9d implies: One prisoner is already serving a final sentence, the other\xe2\x80\x99s has not yet begun.  But a death sentence is different in that it seems to be, and it is, an entirely future event\xe2\x80\x94an event not yet undergone by either prisoner.  And in respect to that event, both prisoners are, in every important respect, in the same position.  I understand there is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinality-based\xe2\x80\x9d difference.  But given the dramatically different nature of death, that difference diminishes in importance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certainly the ordinary citizen will not understand the difference.  That citizen will simply witness two individuals, both sentenced through the use of unconstitutional procedures, one individual going to his death, the other saved, all through an accident of timing.  How can the Court square this spectacle with what it has called the \xe2\x80\x9cvital importance to the defendant and to the commu-\nnity that any decision to impose the death sentence\nbe, and appear to be, based on reason\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/625/index.html">447 U.

He wrote there that \xe2\x80\x9cthe repeated spectacle of a man\xe2\x80\x99s going to his death because <em>a</em> <em>judge </em>found that an aggravating factor existed\xe2\x80\x9d would undermine \xe2\x80\x9cour people\xe2\x80\x99s traditional . . . veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 612 (emphasis in original).  If that is so, it is equally so whether the <em>judge </em>found that aggravating factor before or after <em>Ring</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, <em>Teague </em>recognizes that important interests argue against, and indeed generally forbid, retroactive application of new procedural rules.  These interests include the \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation\xe2\x80\x9d; the desirability of assuring that \xe2\x80\x9cattention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community\xe2\x80\x9d; and the fact that society does not have endless resources to spend upon retrials, which (where witnesses have become unavailable and other evidence stale) may well produce unreliable results.  <em>Mackey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 690\xe2\x80\x93691 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Teague</em>, 489 U. S., at 308\xe2\x80\x93310.  Comity interests and respect for state autonomy point in the same direction.  See <em>id</em>., at 308;<em> Engle</em> v. <em>Isaac</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/107/index.html">456 U. S. 107</a>, 128, n. 33 (1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Certain of these interests are unusually weak where capital sentencing proceedings are at issue.  Retroactivity here, for example, would not require inordinate expenditure of state resources.  A decision making <em>Ring </em>retroactive would affect approximately 110 individuals on death row.  Court Hears Arguments in Latest Death Case, 231 N.\xc2\xa0Y. L.\xc2\xa0J. 5 (2004).  This number, however large in absolute terms, is small compared with the approximately 1.2 million individuals presently confined in state prisons.  U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin 2 (May 2004).  Consequently, the impact on resources is likely to be much less than if a rule affecting the ordinary criminal process were made retroactive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, where the issue is \xe2\x80\x9clife or death,\xe2\x80\x9d the concern that \xe2\x80\x9cattention . . . ultimately\xe2\x80\x9d should be focused \xe2\x80\x9con whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community\xe2\x80\x9d is barely relevant.  <em>Mackey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 690 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Finally, I believe we should discount ordinary finality interests in a death case, for those interests are comparative in nature and death-related collateral proceedings, in any event, may stretch on for many years regardless.  Cf. <em>Teague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 321, n. 3 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cA major reason that Justice Harlan espoused limited retroactivity in collateral proceedings was the interest in making convictions final, an interest that is wholly inapplicable to the capital sentencing context\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third</em>, <em>DeStefano</em> v. <em>Woods</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/631/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/631/index.html">392 U. S. 631</a> (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em>, fails to give the majority the support for which it hopes.  <em>DeStefano</em> did decide that <em>Duncan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding\xe2\x80\x94that the Sixth Amendment jury trial right applies to the States\xe2\x80\x94should <em>not </em>have retroactive effect.  But the Court decided <em>DeStefano </em>before <em>Teague</em>.  And it explicitly took into account \xe2\x80\x9c(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 633 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The latter two factors, \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffect on the administration of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d argued strongly against retroactivity.  Retroactivity there, unlike here, would have thrown the prison doors open wide\xe2\x80\x94at least in Louisiana and possibly in other States as well.  <em>Id</em>., at 634.  The Court believed that the first factor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose to be served by the new standards\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also favored prospective application only.  But the Court described that purpose broadly, as \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression\xe2\x80\x9d; it recognized that some judge-only trials might have been fair; and it concluded that the values served by the jury trial guarantee \xe2\x80\x9cwould not measurably be served by requiring retrial of <em>all</em> persons convicted in the past\xe2\x80\x9d without a jury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 633\xe2\x80\x93634 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  For these reasons, I believe the <em>DeStefano</em> Court would have come out differently had it been considering <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  Insofar as <em>DeStefano</em> has any relevance here, it highlights the importance, when making retroactivity decisions, of taking account of the considerations that underlie <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rules.  And, as shown above, those considerations argue in favor of retroactivity in this case.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I have pointed out, the majority does not deny that <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule makes <em>some</em> contribution to greater accuracy.  It simply is unable to say \xe2\x80\x9cconfidently\xe2\x80\x9d that the absence of <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule creates an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly large risk\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the death penalty was improperly imposed.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  For the reasons stated, I believe that the risk is one that the law need not and should not tolerate.  Judged in light of <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose, <em>Ring</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a jury, and not a judge, must apply the death sentence aggravators announces a watershed rule of criminal procedure that should be applied retroactively in habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
