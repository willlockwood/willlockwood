We were not obligated to grant the case plenary consideration, and we did not; but we were required to deal with its merits.  We did so by concluding that the appeal should be dismissed because the constitutional challenge to the California statute was not a substantial one."</p>\n<p>422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/332/case.html#343">422 U.
