A petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the Alabama Supreme Court. Matheny v. State, 294 Ala. 765, 313 So.2d 552 (1975). </p><p> It is my view that \'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure of unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="984">Page 425 U.S. 982 , 984</a></p><p> basis of their allegedly \'obscene\' contents.\' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#113">413 U.S. 49, 113</a> (1976) (Brennan, J ., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 374(4), as it incorporates the definition of obscene material in 374(3), is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari and, since the judgment of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was rendered after Miller, reverse, petitioner\'s conviction being invalid on all counts. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the question of vagueness presented by petitioner merits plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 494, 495 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting). </p><p> Even accepting the Court\'s decision in Miller v. California, supra, and the obscenity standards there set forth, petitioner\'s conviction should be set aside. It is this Court\'s duty independently to review the fact of obscenity necessary to petitioner\'s conviction. See Jenkins v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/153/case.html">418 U.S. 153</a> (1974). Under Miller, a work may not be obscene unless it \'depicts . . ., in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct.\' 413 U.S., at 24. While exhibition of the genitals may constitute sexual conduct, id., at 25, 93 S. Ct. 2607, such exhibition must be patently offensive and lewd, ibid. \'[N] udity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene under the Miller standards.\' Jenkins v. Georgia, supra, 418 U.S. at 161. Tested by those standards, the material involved in Count One, merely containing photographs of nude women, is clearly not obscene. This being so, a conviction of petitioner based only on Count One of the indictment cannot stand. Because of the general nature of the jury\'s verdict, in the light of the trial court\'s instruction to the jury, it is entirely possible that petitioner\'s conviction did indeed rest solely on the first </p><p><a class="page-number" name="985">Page 425 U.S. 982 , 985</a></p><p> count. In accordance with the Court\'s decision in Bachellar v. Maryland, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/564/case.html">397 U.S. 564</a> (1970), therefore, petitioner\'s conviction should be set aside. </p><p> Mr. Justice STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
