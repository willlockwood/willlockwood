Inmates begin in level 2, which has the most severe restrictions, but may graduate to the less restrictive level 1.  Plaintiff-respondent Banks, a level 2 inmate, filed this federal-court action against defendant-petitioner, the Secretary of the Department of Corrections, alleging that a level 2 policy (Policy) forbidding inmates any access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs violates the First Amendment.  During discovery, Banks deposed Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson and the parties introduced prison policy manuals and related documents into the record.  The Secretary then filed a summary judgment motion, along with a statement of undisputed facts and the deposition.  Rather than filing an opposition to the motion, Banks filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, relying on the undisputed facts, including those in the deposition.  Based on this record, the District Court granted the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion and denied Banks\xe2\x80\x99.  Reversing the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment award, the Third Circuit held that the prison regulation could not be supported as a matter of law.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">399 F. 3d 134, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, concluded that, based on the record before this Court, prison officials have set forth adequate legal support for the Policy, and Banks has failed to show specific facts that could warrant a determination in his favor.

S., at 93, the Constitution sometimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison than it would allow elsewhere, <em>id., </em>at 84\xe2\x80\x9385.  As <em>Overton, supra, </em>at 132, pointed out, courts also owe \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under <em>Turner,</em> restrictive prison regulations are permissible if they are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S.<em>,</em> at 89.  Because this case is here on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion, the Court examines the record to determine whether he has demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact\xe2\x80\x9d and his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.  See, <em>e.g., </em> Fed . Rule Civ. Proc. 56.  If he has, the Court determines whether Banks has \xe2\x80\x9cby affidavits or as otherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 56, \xe2\x80\x9cset forth specific facts showing \xe2\x80\xa6 a genuine issue for trial,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 56(e).  Inferences about disputed facts must be drawn in Banks\xe2\x80\x99 favor, but deference must be accorded prison authorities\xe2\x80\x99 views with respect to matters of professional judgment.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Secretary rested his motion primarily on the undisputed facts statement and Dickson\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit.  The first of his justifications for the Policy\xe2\x80\x94the need to motivate better behavior on the part of particularly difficult prisoners\xe2\x80\x94sufficiently satisfies <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The statement and affidavit set forth a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98valid, rational connection \xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d between the Policy and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legitimate penological interests,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 482 U. S., at 89, 95.  Dickson noted that prison authorities are limited in what they can and cannot deny or give a level 2 inmate, who has already been deprived of most privileges, and that the officials believe that the specified items are legitimate as incentives for inmate growth.  The undisputed facts statement added that the Policy encourages progress and discourages backsliding by level 1 inmates.  These statements point to evidence that the regulations serve the function identified.  The articulated connections between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and a significant incentive to improve behavior, are logical ones.  Thus, this factor supports the Policy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  The second, third, and fourth <em>Turner </em>factors\xe2\x80\x94whether there are \xe2\x80\x9calternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 90; the \xe2\x80\x9cimpact\xe2\x80\x9d that accommodating \xe2\x80\x9cthe asserted constitutional right [will] have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.; and whether there are \xe2\x80\x9cready alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d for furthering the governmental interest, <em>ibid</em>.\xe2\x80\x94add little to the first factor\xe2\x80\x99s logical rationale here.  That two of these three factors seem to favor the Policy therefore does not help the Secretary.  The real task in this case is not balancing the <em>Turner</em> factors but determining whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment material shows not just a logical relation but a <em>reasonable</em> relation.  Given the deference courts must show to prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 professional judgment, the material presented here is sufficient.  <em>Overton </em>provides significant support for this conclusion.  In both cases, the deprivations (family visits in <em>Overton</em> and access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs here) have an important constitutional dimension; prison officials have imposed the deprivation only upon those with serious prison-behavior problems; and those officials, relying on their professional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that the policies help to further legitimate prison objectives.  Unless there is more, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s supporting material brings the Policy within <em>Turner\xe2\x80\x99</em>s scope.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Although summary judgment rules gave Banks an opportunity to respond to these materials, he did not do so in the manner the rules provide.  Instead, he filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Policy fell of its own weight.  Neither the cases he cites nor the statistics he notes support his argument.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Third Circuit placed too high an evidentiary burden on the Secretary and offered too little deference to the prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.  Such deference does not make it impossible for those attacking prison policies to succeed.  A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evidence, for example through depositions, that a policy is not reasonable or that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.  And, as <em>Overton</em> noted<em>, </em>if faced with a <em>de facto</em> permanent ban involving a severe restriction, this Court might reach a different conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that, using the framework set forth in Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 concurrence in <em>Overton</em> v. <em>Bazzetta, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/126/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/126/index.html">539 U. S. 126</a>, 138, Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s prison regulations are permissible.  That framework provides the least perilous approach for resolving challenges to prison regulations and is the approach most faithful to the Constitution.  \xe2\x80\x9cSentencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment may \xe2\x80\xa6 carry with it the implied delegation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 140, n.  A term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such an implied delegation.  Inmates are subject to Department of Corrections rules and disciplinary rulings, and the challenged regulations fall with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  This conclusion is supported by the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a>, analysis.  The \xe2\x80\x9chistory of incarceration as punishment [also] supports the view that the sentenc[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 terminated\xe2\x80\x9d respondent\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered right to magazines, newspapers, and photographs.  <em>Overton, </em>539 U. S., at 142.  While Pennsylvania \xe2\x80\x9cis free to alter its definition of incarceration to include the retention\xe2\x80\x9d of unfettered access to such materials, it appears that the Commonwealth instead sentenced respondent against the backdrop of its traditional conception of imprisonment, which affords no such privileges.  <em>Id., </em> at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.

The LTSU is the most restrictive of the three special units that Pennsylvania maintains for difficult prisoners.  The first such unit, the \xe2\x80\x9cRestricted Housing Unit,\xe2\x80\x9d is designed for prisoners who are under disciplinary sanction or who are assigned to administrative segregation.  App. 80.  The second such unit, the \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Management Unit,\xe2\x80\x9d is intended for prisoners who \xe2\x80\x9cexhibit behavior that is continually disruptive, violent, dangerous or a threat to the orderly operation of their assigned facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

Most, but not all, have \xe2\x80\x9cflunked out\xe2\x80\x9d of the SMU program.  <em>Id</em>., at 137.  To qualify, they must have met one or more of the following conditions: failure to \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d the SMU program; \xe2\x80\x9cassaultive behavior with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d; causing injury to other inmates or staff; \xe2\x80\x9cengaging in facility disturbance(s)\xe2\x80\x9d; belonging to an unauthorized organization or \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity Threat Group\xe2\x80\x9d; engaging in criminal activity that \xe2\x80\x9cthreatens the community\xe2\x80\x9d; possessing while in prison \xe2\x80\x9cweapons\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimplements of escape\xe2\x80\x9d; or having a history of \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d escape attempts, \xe2\x80\x9cexerting negative influence in facility activities,\xe2\x80\x9d or being a \xe2\x80\x9csexual predator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 85\xe2\x80\x9386.  The LTSU is divided into two levels.  All inmates are initially assigned to the most restrictive level, level 2.  After 90 days, depending upon an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, an individual may graduate to the less restrictive level 1, although in practice most do not.  <em>Id</em>., at 131\xe2\x80\x93132, 138.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The RHU, SMU, and LTSU all seriously restrict inmates\xe2\x80\x99 ordinary prison privileges.  At all three units, residents are typically confined to cells for 23 hours a day, have limited access to the commissary or outside visitors, and (with the exception of some phases of the SMU) may not watch television or listen to the radio.  <em>Id</em>., at 102; Brief for Petitioner 2\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prisoners at level 2 of the LTSU face the most severe form of the restrictions listed above.  They have no access to the commissary, they may have only one visitor per month (an immediate family member), and they are not allowed phone calls except in emergencies.  App. 102.  In addition they (unlike all other prisoners in the Commonwealth) are restricted in the manner at issue here: They have no access to newspapers, magazines, or personal photographs.  <em>Id</em>., at 26.  They are nonetheless permitted legal and personal correspondence, religious and legal materials, two library books, and writing paper.  <em>Id</em>., at 35, 102, 169.  If an inmate progresses to level 1, he enjoys somewhat less severe restrictions, including the right to receive one newspaper and five magazines.  <em>Id</em>., at 26, 102.

See Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Banks claimed that the level 2 Policy forbidding inmates all access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs bears no reasonable relation to any legitimate penological objective and consequently violates the First Amendment.  App. 15; see also <em>Turner, supra; Overton, supra</em>.  The Secretary, the defendant, petitioner here, filed an answer.  The District Court certified a class composed of similar level 2 inmates, and the court assigned the case to a Magistrate who conducted discovery.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Banks\xe2\x80\x99 counsel deposed a deputy superintendent at the prison, Joel Dickson.  The parties introduced various prison policy manuals and related documents into the record.  And at that point the Secretary filed a motion for summary judgment.  He also filed a \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of Material Facts Not in Dispute,\xe2\x80\x9d with a copy of the deputy superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s deposition attached as an appendix.  See App. 25; Rule 56.1(C)(1) (WD Pa. 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Banks (who was represented by counsel throughout) filed no opposition to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion, but instead filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  Neither that cross-motion nor any other of Banks\xe2\x80\x99 filings sought to place any significant fact in dispute, and Banks has never sought a trial to determine the validity of the Policy.  Rather, Banks claimed in his cross-motion that the undisputed facts, including those in Dickson\xe2\x80\x99s deposition, entitled him<em> </em>to summary judgment.  In this way, and by failing specifically to challenge the facts identified in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statement of undisputed facts, Banks is deemed to have admitted the validity of the facts contained in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s statement.  See Rule 56.1(E).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the basis of the record as described (the complaint, the answer, the statement of undisputed facts, other agreed-upon descriptions of the system, the Dickson deposition, and the motions for summary judgment), the Magistrate recommended that the District Court grant the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment and deny that of Banks.  App. to Brief in Opposition 130.  The District Court accepted the Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation.  <em>Id</em>., at 131\xe2\x80\x93132.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a divided Third Circuit panel reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s award of summary judgment to the Secretary.  399 F.\xc2\xa03d 134 (2005).  The majority of the panel held that the prison regulation \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be supported as a matter of law by the record in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 148; see also <em>infra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315<em>.</em>  The Secretary sought our review of the Appeals Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and we granted his petition.  546 U.

This Court recognized in <em>Turner </em>that imprisonment does not automatically deprive a prisoner of certain important constitutional protections, including those of the First Amendment.  <em>Id</em>., at 93; see also <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Lone</em> v. <em>Estate of Shabazz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/index.html">482 U.

First, is there a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98valid, rational connection\xe2\x80\x99 between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ibid</em>.  Second, are there \xe2\x80\x9calternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Id</em>., at 90.  Third, what \xe2\x80\x9cimpact\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9caccommodation of the asserted constitutional right \xe2\x80\xa6 have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ibid</em>.

Thus we must examine the record to see whether the Secretary, in  depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits and the like, has demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact\xe2\x80\x9d and his entitlement  to judgment as a matter of law.

S. 317</a> (1986)<em>.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Secretary has done so, then we must determine whether Banks, the plaintiff, who bears the burden of persuasion, <em>Overton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 132,<em> </em>has \xe2\x80\x9cby affidavits or as otherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 56 (<em>e.g.</em> through depositions, etc.) \xe2\x80\x9c<em>set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 56(e) (emphasis added).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If not, the law requires entry of judgment in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  See <em>Celotex Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 322 (Rule 56 \xe2\x80\x9cmandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\xe2\x80\x99s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that at this stage we must draw \xe2\x80\x9call justifiable inferences\xe2\x80\x9d in Banks\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfavor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/242/index.html">477 U. S. 242</a>, 255 (1986).  In doing so, however, we must distinguish between evidence of disputed facts and disputed matters of professional judgment.  In respect to the latter, our inferences must accord deference to the views of prison authorities.  <em>Overton, supra.</em>  Unless a prisoner can point to sufficient evidence regarding such issues of judgment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary in his motion set forth several justifications for the prison\xe2\x80\x99s policy, including the need to motivate better behavior on the part of particularly difficult prisoners, the need to minimize the amount of property they control in their cells, and the need to assure prison safety, by, for example, diminishing the amount of material a prisoner might use to start a cell fire.  We need go no further than the first justification, that of providing increased incentives for better prison behavior.  Applying the well-established substantive and procedural standards set forth in Part II, we find, on the basis of the record before us, that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s justification is adequate.  And that finding here warrants summary judgment in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary rested his motion for summary judgment primarily upon the statement of undisputed facts along with Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit. The statement of undisputed facts says that the LTSU\xe2\x80\x99s 40 inmates, about 0.01 percent of the total prison population, constitute the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98worst of the worst,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d those who \xe2\x80\x9chave proven by the history of their behavior in prison, the necessity of holding them in the rigorous regime of confinement\xe2\x80\x9d of the LTSU.  App. 26.  It then sets forth three \xe2\x80\x9cpenological rationales\xe2\x80\x9d for the Policy, summarized from the Dickson deposition:</p>\n<p align="left"> (1)\xe2\x80\x82to \xe2\x80\x9cmotivat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d better \xe2\x80\x9cbehavior\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of these \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly difficult prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d by providing them with an incentive to move to level 1, or out of the LTSU altogether, and to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscourage backsliding\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of level 1 inmates; </p>\n<p>\n\n (2)\xe2\x80\x82to minimize the amount of property controlled by the prisoners, on the theory that the \xe2\x80\x9cless property these high maintenance, high supervision, obdurate troublemakers have, the easier it is for \xe2\x80\xa6 correctional officer[s] to detect concealed contraband [and] to provide security\xe2\x80\x9d; and</p>\n<p>\n\n(3)\xe2\x80\x82to diminish the amount of material (in particular newspapers and magazines) that prisoners might use as weapons of attack in the form of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98spears\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blow guns,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or that they could employ \xe2\x80\x9cas tools to catapult feces at the guards without the necessity of soiling one\xe2\x80\x99s own hands,\xe2\x80\x9d or use \xe2\x80\x9cas tinder for cell fires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 27.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said we believe that the first rationale itself satisfies <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>requirements. First, the statement and deposition set forth a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98valid, rational connection\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d between the Policy and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legitimate penological objectives.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S., at 89, 95.  The deputy superintendent stated in his deposition that prison authorities are \xe2\x80\x9cvery limited \xe2\x80\xa6 in what we can and cannot deny or give to [a level 2] inmate [who typically has already been deprived of almost all privileges, see <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933], and these are some of the items that we feel are legitimate as incentives for inmate growth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 190.  The statement of undisputed facts (relying on the deposition) added that the Policy \xe2\x80\x9cserves to encourage \xe2\x80\xa6 progress and discourage backsliding by the level 1 inmates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 27.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statements point to evidence\xe2\x80\x94namely, the views of the deputy superintendent\xe2\x80\x94that the regulations do, in fact, serve the function identified.  The articulated connections between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and\na significant incentive to improve behavior, are\nlogical ones.  Thus, the first factor supports the Policy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second factor, the statement and deposition make clear that, as long as the inmate remains at level 2, <em>no</em> \xe2\x80\x9calternative means of exercising the right\xe2\x80\x9d remain open to him.  <em>Turner, supra</em>, at 90. After 90 days the prisoner may be able to graduate to level 1 and thus regain his access to most of the lost rights.  In the approximately 2  years after the LTSU opened, about 25 percent of those confined to level 2 did graduate to level 1 or out of the LTSU altogether.  App. 138; Reply Brief for Petitioner 8.  But these circumstances simply limit, they do not eliminate, the fact that there is no alternative.  The absence of any alternative thus provides \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence that the regulations [a]re unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d but is not \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d of the reasonableness of the Policy.  <em>Overton</em>, 539 U. S., at 135.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the third factor, the statement and deposition indicate that, were prison authorities to seek to \xe2\x80\x9caccommodat[e] . . .  the asserted constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x9d the resulting \xe2\x80\x9cimpact\xe2\x80\x9d would be negative.  That circumstance is also inherent in the nature of the Policy: If the Policy (in the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 view) helps to produce better behavior, then its absence (in the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 view) will help to produce worse behavior, <em>e.g</em>., \xe2\x80\x9cbacksliding\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus the expenditure of more \xe2\x80\x9cresources\xe2\x80\x9d at level 2).  <em>Turner,</em> 482 U. S., at 90.  Similarly, as to the fourth factor, neither the statement nor the deposition describes, points to, or calls to mind any \xe2\x80\x9calternative method of accommodating the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional complaint \xe2\x80\xa6 that fully accommodates the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s rights at <em>de minimis </em>cost to valid penological interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 90\xe2\x80\x9391.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the second, third, and fourth factors, being in a sense logically related to the Policy itself, here add little, one way or another, to the first factor\xe2\x80\x99s basic logical rationale.  See <em>post</em>, at 6 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cdeprivation theory does not map easily onto several of the <em>Turner </em>factors\xe2\x80\x9d), cf. <em>post</em>, at 5-6 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (similar).  The fact that two of these latter three factors seem to support the Policy does not, therefore, count in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The real task in this case is not balancing these factors, but rather determining whether the Secretary shows more than simply a logical relation, that\nis, whether he shows a <em>reasonable</em> relation.  We believe the material presented here by the prison officials is sufficient to demonstrate that the Policy is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Overton </em>provides significant support for this conclusion.  In <em>Overton </em>we upheld a prison\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csevere\xe2\x80\x9d restriction on the family visitation privileges of prisoners with repeat substance abuse violations.  539 U. S., at 134.  Despite the importance of the rights there at issue, we held that withholding such privileges \xe2\x80\x9cis a proper and even necessary management technique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate behavior, especially for high-security prisoners who have few other privileges to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Policy and circumstances here are not identical, but we have not found differences that are significant.  In both cases, the deprivations at issue (all visits with close family members; all access to newspapers, magazines, and photos) have an important constitutional dimension.  In both cases, prison officials have imposed the deprivation at issue only upon those with serious prison-behavior problems (here the 40 most intractable inmates in the Commonwealth).  In both cases, prison officials, relying on their professional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that the policies help to further legitimate prison objectives. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that, if we consider the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s supporting materials, <em>i.e</em>., the statement and deposition), by themselves, they provide sufficient justification for the Policy.  That is to say, unless there is more, they bring the Policy within <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>legitimating scope.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although summary judgment rules provided Banks with an opportunity to respond to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s materials, he did not offer any fact-based or expert-based refutation in the manner the rules provide.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e)\n(requiring plaintiff through, <em>e.g</em>., affidavits, etc., to \xe2\x80\x9cs<em>et forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Instead, Banks filed his own cross-motion for summary judgment in which he claimed that the Policy fell of its own weight, <em>i.e.</em>, that the Policy was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment in C.\xc2\xa0A. 01\xe2\x80\x931956 (WD Pa.), p. 13 (hereinafter Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Brief).  In particular, Banks argued (and continues to argue) that the Policy lacks any significant incentive effect given the history of incorrigibility of the inmates concerned and the overall deprivations associated with the LTSU, Brief for Respondent 22; Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Brief 13.  He points in support to certain court opinions that he believes reflect expert views that favor his position.  <em>Abdul Wali</em> v. <em>Coughlin</em>, 754 F.\xc2\xa02d 1015, 1034 (CA2 1985); <em>Bieregu</em> v. <em>Reno</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d 1445, 1449 (CA3 1995); <em>Knecht </em>v. <em>Collins</em>,<em> </em>903 F. Supp. 1193, 1200 (SD Ohio 1995), aff\xe2\x80\x99d in part, rev\xe2\x80\x99d in part, vacated in part, 187 F.\xc2\xa03d 636 (CA6 1999).  And he adds that only about one-quarter of level 2 inmates graduate out of that environment. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases to which Banks refers, however, simply point out that, in the view of some courts, increased contact with the world generally favors rehabilitation.  See <em>Abdul Wali</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1034; <em>Bieregu</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1449; <em>Knecht</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1200. <em> </em>That circumstance, as written about in court opinions, cannot provide sufficient support, particularly as these courts were not considering contexts such as this one, where prison officials are dealing with especially difficult prisoners.  Neither can Banks find the necessary assistance in the fact that only one-quarter or so of the level 2 population graduates to level 1 or out of the LTSU.  Given the incorrigibility of level 2 inmates\xe2\x80\x94which petitioner himself admits\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing to indicate that a 25 percent graduation rate is low, rather than, as the Secretary suggests, acceptably high.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion.  But in doing so, it placed too high an evidentiary burden upon the Secretary.  In respect to behavior-modification incentives, for example, the court wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9cDistrict Court did not examine \xe2\x80\xa6 whether the ban was implemented in a way that could modify behavior, or inquire into whether the [Department of Corrections\xe2\x80\x99] deprivation theory of behavior modification had any basis in real human psychology, or had proven effective with LTSU inmates.\xe2\x80\x9d  399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 142.  And, the court phrased the relevant conclusions in terms that placed a high summary judgment evidentiary burden upon the Secretary, <em>i.e.</em>, the moving party.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 141 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot say that the [defendant] has shown how the regulations in this case serve [an incentive-related] purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court\xe2\x80\x99s statements and conclusions here also offer too little deference to the judgment of prison officials about such matters.  The court, for example, offered no apparent deference to the deputy prison superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s professional judgment that the Policy deprived \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly difficult\xe2\x80\x9d inmates of a last remaining privilege and that doing so created a significant behavioral incentive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, we do not suggest that the deference owed prison authorities makes it impossible for prisoners or others attacking a prison policy like the present one ever to succeed or to survive summary judgment.  After all, the constitutional interest here is an important one.  <em>Turner </em>requires prison authorities to show more than a formalistic logical connection between a regulation and a penological objective.  A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evidence that, given the importance of the interest, the Policy is not a reasonable one.  Cf. 482 U. S.,<em> </em>at 97\xe2\x80\x9399<em> </em>(striking down prison policy prohibiting prisoner marriages).  And with or without the assistance that public interest law firms or clinics may provide, it is not inconceivable that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, through rigorous questioning of officials by means of depositions, could demonstrate genuine issues of fact for trial.  Finally, as in <em>Overton</em>, we agree that \xe2\x80\x9cthe restriction here is severe,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cif faced with evidence that [it were] a <em>de facto</em> permanent ban . . . we might well reach a different conclusion in a challenge to a particular application of the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 U. S., at 134.  That is not, however, the case before us. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here prison authorities responded adequately through their statement and deposition to the allegations in the complaint.  And the plaintiff failed to point to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98specific facts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the record that could \xe2\x80\x9clead a rational trier of fact to find\xe2\x80\x9d in his favor.  <em>Matsushita Elec.

Just last Term, this Court invalidated California\xe2\x80\x99s policy of racially segregating prisoners in its reception centers, notwithstanding that State\xe2\x80\x99s warning that its policy was necessary to prevent prison violence.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/543/499/index.html">543 U. S. 499</a> (2005).  California subsequently experienced several instances of severe race-based prison violence, including a riot that resulted in 2 fatalities and more than 100 injuries, and significant fighting along racial lines between newly arrived inmates, the very inmates that were subject to the policy invalidated by the Court in <em>Johnson</em>.  See Winton &amp; Bernstein, More Violence Erupts at Pitchess; Black and Latino inmates clash at the north county jail, leaving 13 injured, Los Angeles Times, Mar. 1, 2006, Metro Desk, p. B1.  This powerful reminder of the grave dangers inherent in prison administration confirms my view that the framework I set forth in <em>Overton</em> v. <em>Bazzetta, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/126/index.html">539 U. S. 126</a>, 138 (2003) (opinion concurring in judgment), is the least perilous approach for resolving challenges to prison regulations, as well as the approach that is most faithful to the Constitution.  Accordingly, I concur only in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the plurality and the dissent evaluate the regulations challenged in this case pursuant to the approach set forth in <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987), which permits prison regulations that \xe2\x80\x9cimping[e] on inmates\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d if the regulations are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 89.  But as I explained in <em>Overton</em>, <em>Turner </em>and its progeny<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9crest on the unstated (and erroneous) presumption that the Constitution contains an implicit definition of incarceration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton</em>, 539 U. S., at 139 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Because the Constitution contains no such definition, \xe2\x80\x9cStates are free to define and redefine all types of punishment, including imprisonment, to encompass various types of deprivations\xe2\x80\x94<em>provided only that those deprivations are consistent with the Eighth Amendment</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).<em> </em>Respondent has not challenged Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s prison policy as a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and thus the sole inquiry in this case is whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence deprived him of the rights he now seeks to exercise.  <em>Id</em>., at 140.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhether a sentence encompasses the extinction of a constitutional right enjoyed by free persons turns on state law, for it is a State\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to determine how it will punish violations of its law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Although the question  of whether Pennsylvania intended to confer upon respondent and other inmates a right to have unfettered access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs is thus \xe2\x80\x9cultimately for the State itself to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d in the absence of a resolution of that question by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, we must resolve it in the instant case.  <em>Id</em>., at 141.  Fortunately, the answer is straightforward.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Overton</em>, I explained: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[s]entencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment may, under state law, carry with it the implied delegation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated.  Thus, restrictions imposed by prison officials may also be a part of the sentence, provided that those officials are not acting ultra vires with respect to the discretion given them, by implication, in the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 140, n. *</p>\n<p align="left">\nA term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such\nan implied delegation.  Pennsylvania inmates are subject to the rules and disciplinary measures set forth by\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Bulletin Inmate Discipline, Policy No. DC\xe2\x80\x93ADM 801\n(2004), http://www.cor.state.pa.us/standards/lib/standards/\nDC-ADM_801_Inmate_Discipline.pdf (as visited June 12, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  And no one disputes that the regulations challenged in the instant litigation fall within the discretion given to the Department of Corrections.  As in <em>Overton</em>, the conclusion that these regulations are included in the prison sentence is strongly supported by the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Turner</em> analysis.  A prison policy that has a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid rational connection [to] the \xe2\x80\xa6 legitimate penological objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of improving prison security and discouraging inmate misbehavior, <em>ante,</em> at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted), \xe2\x80\x9cthat [is] designed to avoid adverse impacts on guards, inmates, or prison resources, [and] that cannot be replaced by \xe2\x80\x98ready alternatives,\xe2\x80\x99 [is] presumptively included within a sentence of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton</em>, 539 U.

Indeed, both the Pennsylvania and Auburn prison models, which formed the basis for prison systems throughout the Nation in the early 1800\xe2\x80\x99s, imposed this isolation specifically by denying prisoners access to reading materials and contact with their families.  Rothman, Perfecting the Prison: United States, 1789\xe2\x80\x931865, in The Oxford History of the Prison 117; see also <em>id., </em>at 118 (explaining that in the Pennsylvania system, inmates were \xe2\x80\x9cgiven nothing to read except the Bible and were prevented from corresponding with friends and family\xe2\x80\x9d); S. Christianson, With Liberty for Some: 500 Years of Imprisonment in America 145 (1998) (explaining that in Sing Sing, the standard bearer for the Auburn model, no reading materials of any kind, except the Bible, were allowed inside).  Even as the advent of prison libraries increased prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 access to reading materials, that access was universally \xe2\x80\x9csubject to some form of censorship,\xe2\x80\x9d such that \xe2\x80\x9cinmates of correctional institutions are denied access to books which are freely available to the rest of the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  G.

Accordingly, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s prison regulations must fail.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case reveals the shortcomings of the <em>Turner</em> framework, at least insofar as that framework is applied to prison regulations that seek to modify inmate behavior through privilege deprivation.  In applying the first <em>Turner</em> factor, the plurality correctly observes that Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s policy of depriving its most incorrigible inmates of their last few remaining privileges bears a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid rational connection\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate penological objectiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cencourag[ing] progress and discourag[ing] backsliding\xe2\x80\x9d of inmate compliance with prison rules.  <em>Ante,</em> at 8, 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, this Court has previously determined that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithdrawing \xe2\x80\xa6 privileges is a proper and even necessary management technique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate behavior, especially for high-security prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton, supra</em>, at 134.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although policies, such as Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s, that seek to promote compliance with prison rules by withdrawing various privileges may always satisfy <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first factor, they necessarily fail its second factor.  Such policies, by design, do not provide an \xe2\x80\x9calternative means\xe2\x80\x9d for inmates to exercise the rights they have been deprived.  482 U. S., at 90.  The \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate penological objectiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of encouraging compliance with prison rules by depriving misbehaving inmates of various privileges simply cannot be accomplished if prison officials are required to provide prisoners with an alternative and equivalent set of privileges.  Thus, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s observation that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s privileges may be restored in response to continued, improved behavior, is simply irrelevant to the second factor of <em>Turner</em>, which asks only \xe2\x80\x9cwhether \xe2\x80\xa6 alternative means of exercising the right \xe2\x80\xa6 remain open to prison inmates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The answer in the context of privilege deprivation policies is always no, thus demonstrating the difficulty of analyzing such policies under the <em>Turner</em> framework.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third and fourth <em>Turner </em>factors are likewise poorly suited to determining the validity of inmate privilege deprivation policies.  When the \xe2\x80\x9cvalid penological objectiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of a prison policy is encouraging compliance with prison rules, it makes little sense to inquire into \xe2\x80\x9cthe impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally,\xe2\x80\x9d or into the availability of \xe2\x80\x9cready alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  At best, such inquiries merely collapse the third and fourth factors into the first, because accommodating the exercise of the deprived right will undermine the incentive effects of the prison policy and because the unavailability of \xe2\x80\x9cready alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d is typically (as in this case) one of the underlying rationales for the adoption of inmate privilege deprivation policies.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the prison regulations at issue today are permissible under the approach I explained in <em>Overton</em>, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As in <em>Overton</em>, respondent has not asked this Court to abstain from resolving his constitutional challenge under <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</em> v. <em>Pullman Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/index.html">312 U.

When a prison regulation impinges upon First Amendment freedoms, it is invalid unless \xe2\x80\x9cit is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U.

Under this standard, a prison regulation cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny if \xe2\x80\x9cthe logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390, or if the regulation represents an \xe2\x80\x9cexaggerated response\xe2\x80\x9d to legitimate penological objectives, <em>id.</em>, at 98.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, Pennsylvania prison officials have promulgated a rule that prohibits inmates in Long Term Segregation Unit, level 2 (LTSU\xe2\x80\x932), which is the most restrictive condition of confinement statewide, from possessing any secular, nonlegal newspaper, newsletter, or magazine during the indefinite duration of their solitary confinement.  A prisoner in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 may not even receive an individual article clipped from such a news publication unless the article relates to him or his family.  In addition, under the challenged rule, <em>any</em> personal photograph, including those of spouses, children, deceased parents, or inspirational mentors, will be treated as contraband and confiscated.  See App. 176.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is indisputable that this prohibition on the possession of newspapers and photographs infringes upon respondent\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment rights.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.  The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griswold</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/index.html">381 U.

S. 115</a>, 119\xe2\x80\x93120 (1973) (explaining that photographs, like printed materials, are protected by the First Amendment).  Plainly, the rule at issue in this case strikes at the core of the First Amendment rights to receive, to read, and to think.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner does not dispute that the prohibition at issue infringes upon rights protected by the First Amendment.  Instead, petitioner posits two penological interests, which, in his view, are sufficient to justify the challenged rule notwithstanding these constitutional infringements:  prison security and inmate rehabilitation.  Although these interests are certainly valid, petitioner has failed to establish, as a matter of law, that the challenged rule is reasonably related to these interests.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment, and this Court errs by intervening to prevent a trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning first to the security rationale, which the plurality does not discuss, the Court of Appeals persuasively explained why, in light of the amount of materials LTSU-2 inmates may possess in their cells, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the prohibition on newspapers, magazines, and photographs is likely to have any marginal effect on security.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ach [LTSU\xe2\x80\x932] inmate is given a jumpsuit, a blanket, two bedsheets, a pillow case, a roll of toilet paper, a copy of a prison handbook, ten sheets of writing paper, several envelopes, carbon paper, three pairs of socks, three undershorts and three undershirts, and may at any point also have religious newspapers, legal periodicals, a prison library book, Bibles, and a lunch tray with a plate and a cup.  Many of these items are flammable, could be used [to start fires, catapult feces, or to create other dangers] as effectively as a newspaper, magazine or photograph, and have been so used by [LTSU\xe2\x80\x932] inmates.\xe2\x80\x9d  399 F.\xc2\xa03d 134, 143 (2005) (case below).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the amount of potentially dangerous material to which LTSU-2 inmates are seeking access is quite small in comparison to the amount of material that they already possess in their cells.  As the Court of Appeals emphasized, LTSU-2 inmates \xe2\x80\x9care not requesting unlimited access to innumerable periodicals,\xe2\x80\x9d rather, they are seeking \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to have <em>one</em> newspaper or magazine and some small number of photographs in their cells at one time.\xe2\x80\x9d  399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 144 (emphasis added).  In light of the quantity of materials that LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 inmates are entitled to have in their cell, it does not follow, as a matter of logic, that preventing inmates from possessing a single copy of a secular, nonlegal newspaper, newsletter, or magazine will have any measurable effect on the likelihood that inmates will start fires, hide contraband, or engage in other dangerous actions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, 796 F.\xc2\xa02d 79, 81 (CA5 1986) (Higginbotham, J.) (invalidating a county jail\xe2\x80\x99s ban on newspapers and magazines because, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of the jail\xe2\x80\x99s policy of allowing inmates to possess other material that was flammable and capable of being used to interfere with the plumbing,\xe2\x80\x9d the rule was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo underinclusive\xe2\x80\x9d to be constitutional).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there is no record evidence in this case to support a contrary conclusion.  Deputy Superintendent Joel Dickson, whose deposition is a major part of the sparse record before us, did not identify any dangerous behavior that would be more likely to occur if LTSU-2 inmates obtained the limited access to periodicals that they are seeking.  He did, however, make clear that inmates could engage in any of the behaviors that worried prison officials without using banned materials:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cQ.\xe2\x80\x82Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be fair to say that if an inmate wants to start a fire, he could start a fire using writing paper in combination with a blanket or in combination with clothing or linen, bedding materials?  He could do that; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA.\xe2\x80\x82Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ.\xe2\x80\x82If he wants to throw feces, he could use a cup for that; true?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA.\xe2\x80\x82Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ.\xe2\x80\x82Or if he wants to throw urine, he can use his cup to throw the urine?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA.\xe2\x80\x82Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 196\xe2\x80\x93197.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The security-based justification for the ban on personal photographs is even weaker.  There is not a single statement in Superintendent Dickson\xe2\x80\x99s deposition suggesting that prisoners have used, or would be likely to use, photographic paper to start fires or hurl excrement.  Cf. <em>id., </em>at 196 (stating that paper products are generally used to start fires).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps, at trial, petitioner could introduce additional evidence supporting his view that the challenged regulation is in fact reasonably likely to enhance security or that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for limited access to newspapers and photographs would, for some as yet undisclosed reason, require an unduly burdensome expenditure of resources on the part of prison officials.  However, the above discussion makes clear that, at the very least, \xe2\x80\x9creasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d introduced thus far concerning the relationship between the challenged regulation and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s posited security interest, <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/242/index.html">477 U. S. 242</a>, 250 (1986).  Accordingly, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s valid interest in security is not sufficient to warrant judgment as a matter of law.  See <em>id.</em>, at 250\xe2\x80\x93251.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second rationale posited by petitioner in support of the prohibitions on newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and photographs is rehabilitation.  According to petitioner, the ban \xe2\x80\x9cprovides the [l]evel 2 inmates with the prospect of earning a privilege through compliance with orders and remission of various negative behaviors and serves to encourage the progress and discourage backsliding by the level 1 inmates.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 27.  In the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s view, in light of the present record, this rationale is sufficient to warrant a reversal of the judgment below.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rehabilitation is undoubtedly a legitimate penological interest.  However, the particular theory of rehabilitation at issue in this case presents a special set of concerns for courts considering whether a prison regulation is consistent with the First Amendment.  Specifically, petitioner advances a deprivation theory of rehabilitation: Any deprivation of something a prisoner desires gives him an added incentive to improve his behavior.  This justification has no limiting principle; if sufficient, it would provide a \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d for any regulation that deprives a prisoner of a constitutional right so long as there is at least a theoretical possibility that the prisoner can regain the right at some future time by modifying his behavior.  See <em>Kimberlin </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice</em>, 318 F.\xc2\xa03d 228, 240 (CADC 2003) <em>(per curiam) </em>(Tatel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cregulations that deprive prisoners of their constitutional rights will <em>always</em> be rationally related to the goal of making prison more miserable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the more important the constitutional right at stake (at least from the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 perspective), the stronger the justification for depriving prisoners of that right.  The plurality admits as much:  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the policy (in the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 view) helps to produce better behavior, then its absence (in the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 view) will help to produce worse behavior\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not surprisingly, as Justice Thomas recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 5-6, this deprivation theory does not map easily onto several of the <em>Turner </em>factors, which are premised on prison officials presenting a secondary effects type rationale in support of a challenged regulation.  For instance, under the deprivation theory of rehabilitation, there could never be a \xe2\x80\x9cready alternative\xe2\x80\x9d for furthering the government interest, because the government interest is tied directly to depriving the prisoner of the constitutional right at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the strong form of the deprivation theory of rehabilitation would mean that the prison rule we invalidated in <em>Turner </em>would have survived constitutional scrutiny if the State had simply posited an interest in rehabilitating prisoners through deprivation.  In <em>Turner</em>, we held that a Missouri regulation that forbade inmates from marrying except with the permission of the prison superintendent was facially unconstitutional.  See 482 U. S., at 97\xe2\x80\x9399.  We rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s proffered security and rehabilitation concerns as not reasonably related to the marriage ban.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Taken to its logical conclusion, however, the deprivation theory of rehabilitation would mean that the marriage ban in <em>Turner </em>could be justified because the prohibition furnished prisoners with an incentive to behave well and thus earn early release.  Cf. <em>Safley </em>v. <em>Turner</em>, 586 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 589, 593 (WD Mo. 1984) (noting that, under the Missouri regulations partially invalidated by <em>Turner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a>, inmates had been threatened with the loss of parole for attempting to exercise their marriage rights).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, rehabilitation is a valid penological interest, and deprivation is undoubtedly one valid tool in promoting rehabilitation.  Nonetheless, to ensure that <em>Turner </em>continues to impose meaningful limits on the promulgation of rules that infringe upon inmates\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights, see <em>Thornburgh</em> v. <em>Abbott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/401/index.html">490 U. S. 401</a>, 414 (1989) (stating that <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness standard \xe2\x80\x9cis not toothless\xe2\x80\x9d), courts must be especially cautious in evaluating the constitutionality of prison regulations that are supposedly justified primarily on that basis.  When, as here, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that challenged deprivations have a tenuous logical connection to rehabilitation, or are exaggerated responses to a prison\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in rehabilitation, prison officials are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that, because the various deprivations in the levels of disciplinary confinement short of LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 are also severe, prison officials have no choice but to deprive inmates of core constitutional rights in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 in order to make LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 more unattractive than other types of segregation.  The fact that most States and the Federal Government run their prisons without resorting to the type of ban at issue in this case, see Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 21,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] casts serious doubt upon the need for the challenged constitutional deprivations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, if we consider the severity of the other conditions of confinement in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932, it becomes obvious that inmates have a powerful motivation to escape those conditions irrespective of the ban on newspapers, magazines, and personal photographs.  Inmates in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 face 23 hours a day in solitary confinement, are allowed only one visitor per month, may not make phone calls except in cases of emergency, lack any access to radio or television, may not use the prison commissary, are not permitted General Educational Development (GED) or special education study, and may not receive compensation under the inmate compensation system if they work as a unit janitor.  Although conditions in LTSU\xe2\x80\x931 are also harsh, in several respects unrelated to the challenged regulation, they are far more appealing than the conditions in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932.  LTSU\xe2\x80\x931 inmates may have two visitors and may make one phone call per month; they have access to the commissary; they are permitted in-cell GED or special education study; they are permitted a wider range of counseling services; and they are eligible to obtain compensation under the inmate compensation system.  See App. 43, 102; 399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 148 (case below).  The logical conclusion from this is that, even if LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 prisoners were not deprived of access to newspapers and personal photographs, they would still have a strong incentive to gain promotion to LTSU\xe2\x80\x931.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, prisoners in LTSU\xe2\x80\x931 do <em>not</em> regain access to personal photographs, which means that the ban on photographs cannot be justified by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hope\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that inmates will respond to the constitutional deprivations in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 by improving their behavior so they may graduate into LTSU\xe2\x80\x931, 399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 142 (quoting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel).  Prisoners who \xe2\x80\x9cgraduate\xe2\x80\x9d out of the LTSU\xe2\x80\x931 and back into the general prison population do regain their right to possess personal photographs, but they also regain so many additional privileges\xe2\x80\x94from ending their solitary confinement to regaining access to television and radio\xe2\x80\x94that it strains credulity to believe that that the possibility of regaining the right to possess personal photographs if they eventually return to the general prison population would have any marginal effect on the actions of prisoners in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the logical connection between the ban on newspapers and (especially) the ban on personal photographs, on one hand, and the rehabilitation interests posited by petitioner, on the other, is at best highly questionable.  Moreover, petitioner did not introduce evidence that his proposed theory of behavior modification has any basis in human psychology, or that the challenged rule has in fact had any rehabilitative effect on LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 inmates.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</em>  Accordingly, at least based on the present state of the record, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that prisoners would have a sufficiently powerful incentive to graduate out of LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 even absent the challenged rule, such that the rule is not likely to have any appreciable behavior modification effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The temporal character of LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 status further undermines petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the ban on newspapers and photographs at issue in this case is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.  All LTSU inmates must spend 90 days in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 status.  After that, they receive a review every 30 days to determine if they should be promoted to LTSU\xe2\x80\x931.  That determination is made at the discretion of prison administrators, and is not linked to any specific infraction or compliance.  Petitioner acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n inmate in the LTSU can remain on Level 2 status indefinitely.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 26.  Indeed, as of August 2002, which is the most recent date for which there is record evidence, roughly three-quarters of inmates placed in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 had remained in that status since the inception of the LTSU program over two years earlier.  See <em>id., </em>at 138.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 9 (plurality opinion).  In short, as the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he LTSU Level 2 is a unique kind of segregation with characteristics of both disciplinary and administrative segregation.  Inmates come to LTSU because of \xe2\x80\x98unacceptable behaviors\xe2\x80\x99 in other institutions, but they have not all been adjudicated by a hearing officer to have violated the [Department of Corrections\xe2\x80\x99] rules.  The LTSU is not a place where inmates are sent for a discrete period of punishment, pursuant to a specific infraction, but is a place for \xe2\x80\x98Long Term\xe2\x80\x99 segregation of the most incorrigible and difficult prisoners for as long as they fall under that umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d  399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 141 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indefinite nature of LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 confinement, and the fact that as of August 2002 a significant majority of inmates confined at LTSU\xe2\x80\x932 had remained there since the inception of the program over two years earlier, suggest that the prohibition on newspapers, magazines, and personal photographs is an exaggerated response to the prison\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in rehabilitation.  It would be a different case if prison officials had promulgated a regulation that deprived LTSU-2 inmates of certain First Amendment rights for a short period of time in response to specific disciplinary infractions.  The indefinite deprivations at issue here, however, obviously impose a much greater burden on inmates\xe2\x80\x99 ability to exercise their constitutional rights.  Absent evidence that these indefinite deprivations will be more effective in achieving rehabilitation than shorter periods of deprivation, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the challenged regulation \xe2\x80\x9csweeps much more broadly than can be explained by [prison officials\xe2\x80\x99] penological objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Turner</em>, 482 U. S., at 98, and is hence an exaggerated response to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, as with regard to the current state of the record concerning the connection between the challenged regulation and its effect on prison security, the record is insufficient to conclude, as a matter of law, that petitioner has established a reasonable relationship between his valid interest in inmate rehabilitation and the prohibition on newspapers, magazines, and personal photographs in LTSU\xe2\x80\x932.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is perhaps most troubling about the prison regulation at issue in this case is that the rule comes perilously close to a state-sponsored effort at mind control.  The State may not \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98invad[e] the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment of our Constitution to reserve from all official control.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wooley</em> v. <em>Maynard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/705/index.html">430 U. S. 705</a>, 715 (1977) (quoting <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a>, 642 (1943)).  In this case, the complete prohibition on secular, nonlegal newspapers, newsletters, and magazines prevents prisoners from \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[ing] suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d which are central to the development and preservation of individual identity, and are clearly protected by the First Amendment, <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>FCC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/index.html">395 U. S. 367</a>, 390 (1969).  Similarly, the ban on personal photographs, for at least some inmates, interferes with the capacity to remember<em> </em>loved ones, which is undoubtedly a core part of a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csphere of intellect and spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a context in which these First Amendment infringements could be more severe; LTSU-2 inmates are in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with no access to radio or television, are not permitted to make phone calls except in cases of emergency, and may only have one visitor per month.  They are essentially isolated from any meaningful contact with the outside world.  The severity of the constitutional deprivations at issue in this case should give us serious pause before concluding, as a matter of law, that the challenged regulation is consistent with the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s duty to treat prisoners in accordance with \xe2\x80\x9cthe ethical tradition that accords respect to the dignity and worth of every individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton</em> v. <em>Bazzetta, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/126/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/126/index.html">539 U.

When the logical connection between prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 stated interests and the restrictions on prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights is not self-evident, we have considered whether prison officials proffered any evidence that their regulations served the values they identified.

The Secretary relies on his own statement of undisputed facts and the deposition of the prison\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Superintendent.  The deposition states that \xe2\x80\x9cobviously we are attempting to do the best we can to modify the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s behavior so that eventually he can become a more productive citizen . \xe2\x80\xa6  We\xe2\x80\x99re very limited \xe2\x80\xa6 in what we can and cannot deny or give to an inmate, and [newspapers and photographs] are some of the items that we feel are legitimate as incentives for inmate growth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 189, 190.  The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s statement of undisputed facts similarly asserts that the regulation \xe2\x80\x9cserves to encourage \xe2\x80\xa6 progress and discourage backsliding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 27.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statements, the plurality holds, are sufficient to show that the challenged regulation is reasonably related to inmate rehabilitation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.

The regulation denies The Christian Science Monitor to inmates housed in level 2 of the prison\xe2\x80\x99s long-term segregation unit but allows them The Jewish Daily Forward, based on the determination of a prison official that the latter qualifies as a religious publication and the former does not.\xc2\xa0 App. 179\xe2\x80\x93180; 399 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 147.  Prisoners are allowed to read Harlequin romance novels, but not to learn about the war in Iraq or Hurricane Katrina.

All inferences are to be drawn in favor of the prisoner opposing the regulation, and the question is not which side has the better argument, but whether the Secretary has shown he is entitled to a judgment <em>as a matter of law</em>.  By elevating the summary judgment opponent\xe2\x80\x99s burden to a height prisoners lacking nimble counsel cannot reach, the plurality effectively tells prison officials they will succeed in cases of this order, and swiftly, while barely trying.  It suffices for them to say, in our professional judgment the restriction is warranted.  The asserted right to read, see <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Stevens, J., dissenting), is indeed an \xe2\x80\x9cimportant one,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 12 (plurality opinion of Breyer, J.).
