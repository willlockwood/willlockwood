Because railroads typically didn\xe2\x80\x99t count these in-kind benefits when calculating an employee\xe2\x80\x99s pension on retirement, neither did Congress in its new statutory pension scheme.  Nor did Congress seek to tax these in-kind benefits.

The government argues that these stock options qualify as a form of \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d subject to taxation under the Act.

While stock can be bought or sold for money, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually considered a medium of exchange.  Few people value goods and services in terms of stock, or buy groceries and pay rent with stock.  Adding the word \xe2\x80\x9cremuneration\xe2\x80\x9d also does not alter the meaning of the phrase.  When the statute speaks of taxing \xe2\x80\x9cany form of money remuneration,\xe2\x80\x9d it indicates Congress wanted to tax monetary compensation in any of the many forms an employer might choose.  It does not prove that Congress wanted to tax things, like stock, that are not money at all.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The broader statutory context points to this conclusion.  For example, the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, adopted just two years later, also treated \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstock\xe2\x80\x9d as different things.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa727(d).

The Congress that enacted both of these pension schemes knew well the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d forms of remuneration and its choice to use the narrower term in the context of railroad pensions alone requires respect, not disregard.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Even the IRS (then the Bureau of Internal Revenue) seems to have understood all this back in 1938.  Shortly after the Railroad Retirement Tax Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the IRS issued a regulation explaining that the Act taxes \xe2\x80\x9call remuneration in money, or in something which may be used in lieu of money (scrip and merchandise orders, for example).\xe2\x80\x9d  The regulation said the Act covered things like \xe2\x80\x9c[s]alaries, wages, commissions, fees, [and] bonuses.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the regulation nowhere suggested that stock was taxable.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">In light of these textual and structural clues and others, the Court thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough that the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d unambiguously excludes \xe2\x80\x9cstock.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">856 F.\xc2\xa03d 490, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-H">Gorsuch, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.

To encourage employee performance and align employee and corporate goals, some railroads (like employers in many fields) have adopted employee stock option plans.  Typical of many, the plan before us permits an employee to exercise stock options in various ways\xe2\x80\x94purchasing stock with her own money and holding it as an investment; purchasing stock but immediately selling a portion to finance the purchase; or purchasing stock at the option price, selling it all immediately at the market price, and taking the profits.  App. 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  The government argues that stock options like these qualify as a form of taxable \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act because stock can be easily <i>converted</i> into money.  The railroads reply that stock options aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d at all and remind us that when Congress passed the Act it sought to mimic existing in- dustry pension practices that generally took no notice of in-kind benefits.  Who has the better of it?  Courts  have divided on the answer, so we agreed to take up the question.</p><p>We start with the key statutory term: \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration.\xe2\x80\x9d  As usual, our job is to interpret the words consistent with their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the time Congress enacted the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37, 42 (1979).  And when Congress adopted the Act in 1937, \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d was ordinarily understood to mean currency \xe2\x80\x9cissued by [a] recognized authority as a medium of exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1583 (2d ed. 1942); see also 6 Oxford English Dictionary 603 (1st ed. 1933) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn mod[ern] use commonly applied indifferently to coin and to such promissory documents representing coin (esp. government and bank notes) as are currently accepted as a medium of exchange\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1200 (3d ed. 1933) (in its \xe2\x80\x9cpopular sense, \xe2\x80\x98money\xe2\x80\x99 means any currency, tokens, bank-notes, or other circulating medium in general use as the representative of value\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Railway Express Agency, Inc.</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359, 365 (1954) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]oney .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a medium of exchange\xe2\x80\x9d).  Pretty obviously, stock options do not fall within that definition.  While stock can be bought or sold for money, few of us buy groceries or pay rent or value goods and services in terms of stock.  When was the last time you heard a friend say his new car cost \xe2\x80\x9c2,450 shares of Microsoft\xe2\x80\x9d?  Good luck, too, trying to convince the IRS to treat your stock options as a medium of exchange at tax time.  See<i> </i>Rev. Rul. 76\xe2\x80\x93350, 1976\xe2\x80\x932 Cum. Bull. 396; see also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>In\xc2\xa0re Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s Estate</i>, 2 Cal.

Of course, \xe2\x80\x9cremuneration\xe2\x80\x9d can encompass any kind of reward or compensation, not just money.  8 Oxford English Dictionary 439.  But in the sentence before us, the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d modifies the noun \xe2\x80\x9cremuneration.\xe2\x80\x9d  So \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d limits the kinds of remuneration that will qualify for taxation; \xe2\x80\x9cremuneration\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expand what counts as money.  When the statute speaks of taxing \xe2\x80\x9cany form of money remuneration,\xe2\x80\x9d then, it indicates Congress wanted to tax monetary compensation in any of the many forms an employer might choose\xe2\x80\x94coins, paper currency, checks, wire transfers, and the like.  It does not prove Congress wanted to tax things, like stock, that aren\xe2\x80\x99t money at all.</p><p>The broader statutory context points to the same conclusion the immediate text suggests.  The 1939 Internal Revenue Code, part of the same title as our statute and adopted just two years later, expressly treated \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstock\xe2\x80\x9d as different things.  Consider a few examples.  The Code described \xe2\x80\x9cstock of the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cproperty other than money.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa727(d).  It explained that a corporate distribution is taxable when distributed \xe2\x80\x9ceither (A) in [the company\xe2\x80\x99s] stock .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or (B) in money.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7115(f)(2).  And it discussed transfers of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney in addition to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. stock or securities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7372(b).  While ultimately ruling for the government, even the Court of Appeals in this case conceded that the 1939 Code \xe2\x80\x9ctreat[ed] \xe2\x80\x98money\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98stock\xe2\x80\x99 as different concepts.\xe2\x80\x9d  856 F.\xc2\xa03d 490, 492 (CA7 2017).  </p><p>That\xe2\x80\x99s not all.  The same Congress that enacted the Railroad Retirement Tax Act enacted a companion statute, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), to fund social security pensions for employees in other industries.  And while the Railroad Retirement Tax Act taxes only \xe2\x80\x9c<i>money</i> remuneration,\xe2\x80\x9d FICA taxes \xe2\x80\x9c<i>all</i> remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 including benefits \xe2\x80\x9cpaid in any medium other than cash.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73121(a) (emphasis added).  We usually \xe2\x80\x9cpresume differences in language like this convey differences in meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henson</i> v. <i>Santander Consumer USA Inc.</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6).  And that presumption must bear particular strength when the same Congress passed both statutes to handle much the same task.  See <i>INS</i> v. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca</i>,480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421, 432 (1987).  The Congress that enacted both of these pension schemes knew well the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d forms of remuneration.  Its choice to use the narrower term in the context of railroad pensions alone requires respect, not disregard.  </p><p>Even the IRS (then the Bureau of Internal Revenue) seems to have understood all this back in 1938.  Shortly after the Railroad Retirement Tax Act\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the IRS issued a regulation explaining that the Act taxes \xe2\x80\x9call remuneration in money, or in something which may be used in lieu of money.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa7410.5 (1938).  By way of example, the regulation said the Act taxed things like \xe2\x80\x9c[s]alaries, wages, commissions, fees, [and] bonuses.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7410.6(a).  But it nowhere suggested that stock was tax- able.  Nor was the possibility lost on the IRS.  The IRS said the Act <i>did</i> tax money payments <i>related</i> to stock\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[p]ayments made by an employer into a stock bonus .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7410.6(f).  But the agency did not seek to extend the same treatment to stock itself.  So even assuming the validity of the regulation, it seems only to confirm our understanding.  </p><p>To be sure, the regulation also lists \xe2\x80\x9cscrip and merchandise orders\xe2\x80\x9d as examples of qualifying mediums of exchange.  \xc2\xa7410.5.  For argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, too, we will accept that the word \xe2\x80\x9cscrip\xe2\x80\x9d can sometimes embrace stock.  But even if \xe2\x80\x9cscrip\xe2\x80\x9d is <i>capable</i> of bearing this meaning, at the time the IRS promulgated the regulation in 1938 that was not its <i>ordinary</i> meaning.  As even the government acknowledged before the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9cscrip\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily meant \xe2\x80\x9ccompany-issued certificates\xe2\x80\x9d that employees could use in lieu of cash \xe2\x80\x9cto purchase merchandise at a company store.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in Nos. 16\xe2\x80\x933300 etc. (CA7 2017), p.\xc2\xa037.  This understanding fits perfectly as well with the whole phrase in which the term appears; both \xe2\x80\x9cscrip and merchandise orders\xe2\x80\x9d were frequently used at the time to purchase goods at company stores.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2249 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cscrip\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. issued to circulate in lieu of government currency\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cby a corporation that pays wages partly in orders on a company store\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Keokee Consol. Coke Co.</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,234 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224, 226 (1914) (company gave its employees \xe2\x80\x9cscrip .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as an advance of monthly wages in payment for labor performed\xe2\x80\x9d that could be used to purchase merchandise at the company store); Gatch, Local Money in the United States During the Great Depression, 26 Essays in Economic &amp; Bus. History 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (2008).</p><p>What does the government have to say about all this?  It concedes that money remuneration often means remuneration in a commonly used medium of exchange.  But, it submits, the term can carry a much more expansive meaning too.  At least sometimes, the government says, \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d means any \xe2\x80\x9cproperty or possessions of any kind viewed  as convertible into money or having value expressible in terms of money.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 Oxford English Dictionary 603.  The dissent takes the same view.  See <i>post, </i>at 3 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But while the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d <i>sometimes </i>might be used in this much more expansive sense, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t how the term was <i>ordinarily </i>used at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s adoption (or is even today).  Baseball cards, vinyl records, snow globes, and fidget spinners all have \xe2\x80\x9cvalue expressible in terms of money.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even that \xe2\x80\x9cpriceless\xe2\x80\x9d Picasso has a price.  Really, almost <i>anything </i>can be reduced to a \xe2\x80\x9cvalue expressible in terms of money.\xe2\x80\x9d  But in ordinary usage does \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d mean almost <i>everything</i>?    </p><p>The government and the dissent supply no persuasive proof that Congress sought to invoke their idiosyncratic definition.  If Congress really thought everything is money, why did it take such pains to differentiate between  money and stock in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939?  Why did it so carefully distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act and \xe2\x80\x9call remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d in FICA?  Why did  it include the word \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d to qualify \xe2\x80\x9cremuneration\xe2\x80\x9d if all remuneration counts as money?  And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the everything-is-money interpretation encompass railroad tickets, food, and lodging\xe2\x80\x94exactly the sort of in-kind benefits we know the Act was written to <i>exclude</i>?  These questions they cannot answer.     </p><p>To be sure, the government and dissent do seek to offer a different structural argument of their own.  They point to certain of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s tax exemptions, most notably the exemption for qualified stock options.  See26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73231(e)(12); <i>post, </i>at 6 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Because the Act <i>excludes </i>qualified stock options from taxation, the argument goes, to avoid superfluity it must <i>include </i>other sorts of stock options like the nonqualified<i> </i>stock options the railroads issued here.  The problem, though, is that the exemption covers \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any </i>remuneration <i>on account of</i>\xe2\x80\x9d qualified stock options.  \xc2\xa73231(e)(12)<i> </i>(emphasis added).<i> </i>And, as the government concedes, companies sometimes include money payments when qualified stock options are exercised (often to compensate for fractional shares due an employee).  Brief for United States 30.  As a result, the exemption does work under anyone\xe2\x80\x99s reading.    </p><p>The government replies that Congress would not have bothered to write an exemption that does only this modest work.  To have been worth the candle, Congress must have assumed that stock options would qualify as money remuneration without a specific exemption.  But we will not join this guessing game.  It is not our function \xe2\x80\x9cto rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have\xe2\x80\x9d intended.  <i>Henson</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Besides, even if the railroads\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute threatens to leave one of many exemptions with little to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s hardly a reason to abandon it, for the government\xe2\x80\x99s and dissent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative promises a graver surplusage problem of its own.  As it did in 1939, the Internal Revenue Code today repeatedly distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9cstock\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa7306(c)(2) (referring to a situation where \xe2\x80\x9cmoney had been distributed in lieu of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. stock\xe2\x80\x9d).  All these distinctions the government and dissent would simply obliterate.  </p><p>Reaching further afield, the government and dissent point to a 1938 agency interpretation of another companion statute, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937.  See <i>post, </i>at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Here, the Railroad Retirement Board suggested that the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d in the Railroad Retirement Act could sometimes include in-kind benefits.  Again we may assume the valid- ity of the regulation because, even taken on its own terms, it only ends up confirming our interpretation.  The Board indicated that in-kind benefits could count as money remuneration <i>only</i> if the employer and employee agreed to this treatment and to the dollar value of the benefit.  20 CFR \xc2\xa7222.2 (1938).  That same year, the Board made clear that stock was treated just like any other in-kind benefit under this rule: \xe2\x80\x9cstock cannot be considered as a \xe2\x80\x98form of money remuneration earned by an individual for services rendered\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d unless part of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cagreed compensation\xe2\x80\x9d and awarded \xe2\x80\x9cat a definite agreed value.\xe2\x80\x9d  Railroad Retirement Bd. Gen. Counsel Memorandum No. L\xe2\x80\x9338\xe2\x80\x93440, pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x932 (1938).  Later, the Board provided fuller explanation for its longstanding view, stating that these conditions are necessary because, unlike FICA, the Act does <i>not</i> cover \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98remuneration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. paid in any medium.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Railroad Retirement Bd. Gen. Counsel Memorandum No.\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x80\x931986\xe2\x80\x9382, p. 6 (1986).  For decades, then, the Board has taken the view that nonmonetary remuneration is \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. included in compensation under the [Act] unless the employer and employee first agree to [its] dollar value . . . and then agree that this dollar value shall be part of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s compensation package.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>None of these preconditions would be needed, of course, if the Act <i>automatically</i> taxed in-kind benefits as the government and dissent insist. </p><p>Finally, the government seeks <i>Chevron </i>deference for a more recent IRS interpretation treating \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act as having \xe2\x80\x9cthe same meaning as the term wages in\xe2\x80\x9d FICA \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as specifically limited by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3231(e)\xe2\x80\x931 (2017).  But in light of all the textual and structural clues before us, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough that the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d excludes \xe2\x80\x9cstock,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving no ambiguity for the agency  to fill.  See <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837, 843, n.\xc2\xa09 (1984).  Nor does the regulation help the government even on its own terms.  FICA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of wages\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<i>all</i> remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>is </i>\xe2\x80\x9cspecifically limited by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which applies only to \xe2\x80\x9c<i>money </i>remuneration.\xe2\x80\x9d  So in the end all the regulation winds up saying is that everyone should look carefully at the relevant statutory texts.  We agree, and that is what we have done.</p><p>The Court of Appeals in this case tried a different tack still, if over a dissent.  The majority all but admitted that stock isn\xe2\x80\x99t money, but suggested it would make \xe2\x80\x9cgood practical sense\xe2\x80\x9d for our statute to cover stock as well as money.  856 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 492.  Meanwhile, Judge Manion dissented, countering that it\xe2\x80\x99s a judge\xe2\x80\x99s job only to apply, not revise or update, the terms of statutes.  See <i>id.</i>, at 493.  The Eighth Circuit made much the same point when it addressed the question.  See <i>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co. </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 865 F.\xc2\xa03d 1045, 1048\xe2\x80\x931049 (2017).  Judge Man- ion and the Eighth Circuit were right.  Written laws are meant to be understood and lived by.  If a fog of uncertainty surrounded them, if their meaning could shift with the latest judicial whim, the point of reducing them to writing would be lost.  That is why it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental canon of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x9d that words generally should be \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the time Congress enacted the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perrin</i>, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 42.  Congress alone has the institutional competence, democratic legitimacy, and (most importantly) constitutional authority to revise statutes in light of new social problems and preferences.  Until it exercises that power, the people may rely on the original meaning of the written law.</p><p>This hardly leaves us, as the dissent worries, \xe2\x80\x9ctrapped in a monetary time warp, forever limited to those forms of money commonly used in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 3 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  While every statute\xe2\x80\x99s <i>meaning </i>is fixed at the time of enactment, new <i>applications</i> may arise in light of changes in the world.  So \xe2\x80\x9cmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in this statute, must always mean a \xe2\x80\x9cmedium of exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  But what <i>qualifies </i>as a \xe2\x80\x9cmedium of exchange\xe2\x80\x9d may depend on the facts of the day.  Take electronic transfers of paychecks.  Maybe they weren\xe2\x80\x99t common in 1937, but we do not doubt they would qualify today as \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s original public meaning.  The problem with the government\xe2\x80\x99s and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position today is not that stock and stock options weren\xe2\x80\x99t common in 1937, but that they were not then\xe2\x80\x94and are not now\xe2\x80\x94recognized as mediums of exchange. </p><p>The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3918491">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 17\xe2\x80\x93530</p><p>_________________</p><p>WISCONSIN CENTRAL LTD., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p><p>on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p><p>[June 21, 2018]</p><p>Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p><p>The case before us concerns taxable \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act.

Does that phrase include stock options paid to railroad employees \xe2\x80\x9cfor services rendered\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Ibid.  </i>In my view, the language itself is ambiguous but other traditional tools of statutory interpretation point to the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consequently, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the language\xe2\x80\x94which it has followed consistently since the inception of the statute\xe2\x80\x94is lawful.  I therefore dissent.</p><p>I</p><p>A stock option consists of a right to buy a specified amount of stock at a specific price.  If that price is lower than the current market price of the stock, a holder of the option can exercise the option, buy the stock at the option price, and keep the stock, or he can buy the stock, sell it at the higher market price, and pocket the difference.  Companies often compensate their employees in part by paying them with stock options, hoping that by doing so they will provide an incentive for their employees to work harder to increase the value of the company.</p><p>Employees at petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 companies who receive and exercise a stock option may keep the stock they buy as long as they wish.  But they also have another choice called the \xe2\x80\x9ccashless exercise\xe2\x80\x9d method.  App. 42.  That method permits an employee to check a box on a form, thereby asking the company\xe2\x80\x99s financial agents to buy the stock (at the option price) and then immediately sell the stock (at the higher market price) with the proceeds deposited into the employee\xe2\x80\x99s bank account\xe2\x80\x94just like a deposited paycheck.  <i>Ibid.</i>  About half (around 49%) of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 employees used this method (or a variation of it) during the relevant time period.  Separate App. of Plaintiffs-Appellants in No. 16\xe2\x80\x933300 (CA7), p.\xc2\xa045.

I am less sanguine.  True, some of those dictionaries say that \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d primarily refers to currency or promissory documents used as \xe2\x80\x9ca medium of exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But even this definition has its ambiguities.  A railroad employee cannot use her paycheck as a \xe2\x80\x9cmedium of exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  She cannot hand it over to a cashier at the grocery store; she must first deposit it.  The same is true of stock, which must be converted into cash and deposited in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s account before she can enjoy its monetary value.  Moreover, what we view as money has changed over time.  Cowrie shells once were such a medium but no longer are, see J. Weatherford, The History of Money 24 (1997); our currency originally included gold coins and bullion, but, after 1934, gold could not be used as a medium of exchange, see Gold Reserve Act of 1934, ch. 6, \xc2\xa72,48Stat.337; perhaps one day employees will be paid in Bitcoin or some other type of cryptocurrency, see F. Martin, Money: The Unauthorized Biography\xe2\x80\x94From Coinage to Cryptocurrencies<i> </i>275\xe2\x80\x93278 (1st Vintage Books ed. 2015).  Nothing in the statute suggests the meaning of this provision should be trapped in a monetary time warp, forever limited to those forms of money commonly used in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s.</p><p>Regardless, the formal \xe2\x80\x9cmedium of exchange\xe2\x80\x9d definition is not the only dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d now or then.  The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, included in its definition \xe2\x80\x9cproperty or possessions of any kind viewed as convertible into money,\xe2\x80\x9d 6 Oxford English Dictionary 603 (1st ed. 1933); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary said that money was the representative of \xe2\x80\x9ceverything that can be transferred in commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1200 (3d ed. 1933); and the New Century Dictionary defined money as \xe2\x80\x9cproperty considered with reference to its pecuniary value,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 New Century Dictionary of the English Language 1083 (1933).  Although the majority brushes these definitions aside as contrary to the term\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary usage,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 6, a broader understanding of money is perfectly intuitive\xe2\x80\x94particularly in the context of compensation.  Indeed, many of the country\xe2\x80\x99s top executives are compensated in both cash and stock or stock options.  Often, as is the case with the president of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 parent company, executives\xe2\x80\x99 stock-based compensation far exceeds their cash salary.  Brief for United States 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But if you were to ask (on, say, a mortgage application) how much money one of those executives made last year, it would make no sense to leave the stock and stock options out of the calculation.</p><p>So, where does this duel of definitions lead us?  Some seem too narrow; some seem too broad; some seem indeterminate.  The result is ambiguity.  Were it up to me to choose based only on what I have discussed so far, I would say that a stock option is a \xe2\x80\x9cform of money remuneration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Why?  Because for many employees it almost immediately takes the form of an increased bank balance, because it strongly resembles a paycheck in this respect, and because the statute refers to \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any form</i>\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>of money remuneration.  A paycheck is not money, but it is a means of remunerating employees monetarily.  The same can be said of stock options.</p><p>B</p><p>Fortunately, we have yet more tools in our interpretive arsenal, namely, all the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional tools of statutory construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>INS</i> v. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca</i>,480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421, 446 (1987).  Let us look to purpose.  What could Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose have been when it used the word \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d?  The most obvious purpose would be to exclude certain in-kind benefits that are nonmonetary\xe2\x80\x94either because they are nontransferrable or otherwise difficult to value.  When Congress enacted the statute, it was common for railroad workers to receive free transportation for life. Taxation of Interstate Carriers and Employees: Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 8652<i> </i>before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.,\xc2\xa06 (1935).  Unlike stock options, it would have been difficult to value this benefit. And even very broad definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d would seem to exclude it.  <i>E.g., </i>6 Oxford English Dictionary, at 603.</p><p>Another interpretive tool, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history, tends to confirm this view of the statutory purpose (and further supports inclusion of stock options for that reason).  An earlier version of the Act explicitly excluded from taxation any \xe2\x80\x9cfree transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d along with such in-kind benefits as \xe2\x80\x9cboard, rents, housing, [and] lodging\xe2\x80\x9d provided that their value was less than $10 per month (about $185 per month today).  S. 2862, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa71(e), p. 3 (1935).  In other words, they were incidental benefits that were particularly difficult to value.  Congress later dropped these specific provisions from the bill on the ground that they were \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 697, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.,\xc2\xa08 (1937).</p><p>Excluding stock options from taxation under the statute would not further this basic purpose and would be inconsistent with this aspect of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history, for stock options are financial instruments.  They can readily be bought and sold, they are not benefits in kind (<i>i.e., </i>they have no value to employees other than their financial value), and\xe2\x80\x94compared to, say, meals or spontaneous train trips\xe2\x80\x94they are not particularly difficult to value.</p><p>Nor is it easy to see what purpose the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would serve.  Congress designed the Act to provide a financially stable, self-sustaining system of retirement benefits for railroad employees.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 6, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (1953); see also 2 Staff of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.,\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315 (Jt. Comm. Print 1972) (describing financial difficulties facing the private railroad pension programs that Congress sought to replace).  Nevertheless, petitioners speculate that Congress intended to limit the Act\xe2\x80\x99s tax base to employees\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cregular pay\xe2\x80\x9d because that more closely resembled the way private pensions in the railroad industry calculated a retiree\xe2\x80\x99s annuity.  Brief for Petitioners 8.  But the Act taxes not simply monthly paychecks but also bonuses, commissions, and contributions to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s retirement account (like a 401(k)), see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73231(e)(1), (8)\xe2\x80\x94none of which were customarily considered in railroad pension calculations.  Why distinguish stock options from these other forms of money remuneration\xe2\x80\x94particularly when almost half the employees who participated in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 stock option plan (and nearly all such employees at other railroads) have the option\xe2\x80\x99s value paid directly into their bank accounts in cash?  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.</p><p>The statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure as later amended offers further support.  That is because a later amendment expressly <i>excluded </i>from taxation certain stock options, namely, \xe2\x80\x9c[q]ualified stock options,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa73231(e)(12), which tax law treats more favorably (and which are also excluded from the Social Security tax base, \xc2\xa73121(a)(22)).  What need would there be to exclude expressly a subset of stock options if the statute already excluded <i>all </i>stock options from its coverage?  The same is true of certain in- kind benefits, such as life-insurance premiums.  See \xc2\xa73231(e)(1)(i).  Congress has more recently amended the statute to exclude expressly other hard-to-value fringe benefits.  See \xc2\xa73231(e)(5).  Again what need would there be to do so if all noncash benefits, including stock options, were already excluded?</p><p>C</p><p>There are, of course, counterarguments and other considerations, which the majority sets forth in its opinion.  The majority asserts, for example, that Congress must have intended the Act to be read more narrowly because, shortly after enacting the statutory language at issue in this dispute, Congress enacted the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), which uses different language to establish its tax base.  The Railroad Retirement Tax Act defines \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d in part as \xe2\x80\x9cany form of money remuneration,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73231(e)(1) while FICA defines \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d as including the \xe2\x80\x9ccash value of all remuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium other than cash,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73121(a).  But there is no canon of interpretation forbidding Congress to use different words in different statutes to mean somewhat the same thing.  See <i>Kirtsaeng</i> v. <i>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519, 540 (2013)<i>.  </i>And the meaning of the statutory terms as I read them are not identical, given FICA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d would include those types of noncash benefits that the Railroad Retirement Tax Act exempts from taxation.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p><p>At most, this conflicting statutory language leaves the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d unclear.  In these circumstances, I would give weight to the interpretation of the Government agency that Congress charged with administering the statute.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere a statute leaves a \xe2\x80\x98gap\xe2\x80\x99 or is \xe2\x80\x98ambiguous\xe2\x80\x99 we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 13) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.</i>,533 U. S. 218, 229 (2001); <i>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984)).  And even outside that framework, I would find the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views here particularly persuasive.  <i>Skidmore</i> v. <i>Swift &amp; Co.</i>,323 U. S. 134, 139\xe2\x80\x93140 (1944).  The interpretation was made contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute itself, <i>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,288 U. S. 294, 315 (1933), and the Government has not since interpreted the statute in a way that directly contradicts that contemporaneous interpretation, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Cardoza-Fonseca</i>, 480 U. S., at 446, n. 30; <i>Watt</i> v. <i>Alaska</i>,451 U. S. 259, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (1981).  Congress, over a period of nearly 90 years, has never revised or repealed the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation, despite modifying other provisions in the statute, which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Schor</i>,478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833, 846 (1986) (quoting <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Bell Aerospace Co.</i>,416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267, 274\xe2\x80\x93275 (1974)).  Nor did the railroad industry object to the taxation of stock options based on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation until recent years.  See, <i>e.g., Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 2016 U.\xc2\xa0S. Dist.

Stroud, Judicial Dictionary 1802 (2d ed. 1903) (\xe2\x80\x9ca [c]ertificate, transferable by delivery, entitling its holder to become a Shareholder or Bondholder in respect of the shares or bonds therein mentioned\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority, though clearly fond of 1930\xe2\x80\x99s-era dictionaries, rejects these definitions because, in its view, they do not reflect the term\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<i>ordinary</i> meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5.  But the majority has no basis for this assertion.  Contra <i>Eisner</i> v. <i>Macomber</i>,252 U.\xc2\xa0S. 189, 227 (1920) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (re- ferring to \xe2\x80\x9cbonds, scrip or stock\xe2\x80\x9d as similar instruments of corporate finance).</p><p>The Treasury Department was not alone in interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoney remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly.  In 1938 the Railroad Retirement Board\xe2\x80\x99s regulations treated the term \xe2\x80\x9cany form of money remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d as including \xe2\x80\x9ca commodity, service, or privilege\xe2\x80\x9d that had an \xe2\x80\x9cagreed upon\xe2\x80\x9d value.  20 CFR \xc2\xa7222.2; see also 20 CFR \xc2\xa7211.2 (2018) (current version).  At least one contemporaneous legal opinion from the Board\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel specifically concluded that stock received by \xe2\x80\x9cemployees as a part of their agreed compensation for services actually rendered and at a definite agreed value\xe2\x80\x9d qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cform of money remuneration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Railroad Retirement Bd. Gen. Counsel Memorandum No. L\xe2\x80\x931938\xe2\x80\x93440, p. 2 (Apr. 22, 1938).  And in a more recent opinion, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel stated that nonqualified stock options (the type of stock option at issue in this dispute) are taxable under the Act.  Railroad Retirement Bd. Gen. Counsel Memorandum No. L\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x9325, p.\xc2\xa06 (Dec. 2, 2005).</p><p>The majority plucks from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s long administrative history a 1986 Board legal opinion stating that an in-kind benefit should not be treated as compensation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unless the employer and employee first agree to [its] dollar value .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and then agree that this dollar value shall be part of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s compensation package.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8 (quoting Railroad Retirement Bd. Gen. Counsel Memorandum No. L\xe2\x80\x931986\xe2\x80\x9382, p. 6 (June 3, 1986)).  But the majority neglects to share that the deputy general counsel who wrote that legal opinion was not discussing stock or stock options, but rather was discussing a \xe2\x80\x9cfringe benefit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94specifically free rail passes employers purchased on behalf of their employees so they could ride on other carriers\xe2\x80\x99 trains.  <i>Ibid.  </i>As I explained above, <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, such non-transferrable travel benefits were difficult to value and thus were excluded from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of money remuneration.  (Though the Board\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to treat at least <i>some</i> fringe benefits as a \xe2\x80\x9cform of money remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrates that the Board took a more flexible view of the term\xe2\x80\x94a view that is contrary to the rigid dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d the majority prefers, which excludes all forms of in-kind benefits.  See <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933.)</p><p>A stock option, unlike free travel benefits, has a readily discernible value: namely, the difference between the option price and the market price when the employee exercises the option.  For those employees who use the \xe2\x80\x9ccashless exercise\xe2\x80\x9d method, that difference is the amount that is deposited into their account as cash (minus fees).  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  No one disputes that this is the value of the option when it is exercised.  See Stipulations of Fact in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9310243, Exh. 13 (ND Ill.), p. CN168 (describing the taxable benefit from exercising a stock option).  And no one disputes that granting employees stock options is a form of remuneration.  See <i>ante, </i>at 3 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98remuneration\xe2\x80\x99 can encompass any kind of reward or compensation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The 1986 legal opinion on rail passes the majority invokes simply has no bearing on the tax treatment of stock options in this case.</p><p>More recently, the Treasury has issued a regulation stating that the Railroad Retirement Tax Act\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d (which, the reader will recall, the Act defines as \xe2\x80\x9cany form of money remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d) has the same meaning as the term \xe2\x80\x9cwages\xe2\x80\x9d in FICA \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>except as specifically limited by</i>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<i> the Railroad Retirement Tax Act or by regulation.</i>  Brief for Petitioners 47.  Petitioners do not dispute that FICA long has counted stock options as compensation.  See <i>id.,</i> at 39\xe2\x80\x9347.  Neither the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text nor any regulation limits us from doing the same for the Railroad Retirement Tax Act.  If anything, the earlier Treasury and Board regulations and opinions make clear that, in the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Act does <i>not</i> \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically limit\xe2\x80\x9d the application of its terms by excluding stock options from its coverage.</p><p>The Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is a reason- able one.  For one thing, it creates greater uniformity be- tween the Railroad Retirement Tax Act\xe2\x80\x99s pension-like taxing system and the Social Security system governed by FICA.  To seek administrative uniformity is (other things being equal) a reasonable objective given the similarity of purpose and methods the two Acts embody.  And subsequent amendments to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (which have generally mirrored provisions in FICA) demonstrate that Congress intended these tax regimes to be treated the same.  See Update of Railroad Retirement Tax Act Regulations, 59 Fed. Reg. 66188 (1994) (observing that Congress has taken steps to \xe2\x80\x9cconfor[m] the structure of the [Railroad Retirement Tax Act] to parallel that of the FICA\xe2\x80\x9d); compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73231(e)(1), (9) with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73121(a)(2)(C), (a)(19).  For another, it helps to avoid the unfairness that would arise out of treating differently two individuals (who received roughly the same amount of money in their bank accounts) simply because one received a paycheck while the other received proceeds from selling company stock.</p><p>Here, in respect to stock options, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language has a degree of ambiguity.  But the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, along with its amendments, argues in favor of including stock options.  The Government has so interpreted the statute for decades, and Congress has never suggested it held a contrary view, despite making other statutory changes.  In these circumstances, I believe the Government has the stronger argument.  I would read the statutory phrase as including stock options.  And, with respect, I dissent from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
