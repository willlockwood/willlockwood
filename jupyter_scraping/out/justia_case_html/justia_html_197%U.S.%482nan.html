Mr. Cotton was a citizen of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>Thereupon a form of contract was prepared and executed by the then Governor of Massachusetts, in behalf and under the seal of the commonwealth, and by Cotton, and a duplicate original thereof was deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.</p>\n<p>The prosecution of the claim was at once entered upon, and after five years was finally adjudicated, audited, and passed.</p>\n<p>On or about May 2, 1904, the Treasury Department issued and delivered to Cotton, as the duly authorized agent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, war settlement warrant No. 11,343, payable "to the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, or order," for the sum of $1,611,740.85, and addressed, "P.

Shaw, Secretary of the Treasury, and John L. Bates, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," in which he asserted his right to an attorney\'s lien upon the papers of his client, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the warrant in question, and prayed, among other things, that said Leslie M. Shaw might be restrained and enjoined from cancelling the warrant which had been delivered to him, and from drawing or issuing a duplicate thereof to said Bates, and</p>\n<p>"that the defendant John L.

S. 487</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This Court has no original jurisdiction over this controversy in any view, because it is not a controversy between a state and a citizen of another state.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/445/case.html">Hepburn v. Ellzey,</a></span></em> 2 Cranch 445; <em>Hooe v. Jamieson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/166/395/case.html">166 U. S. 395</a></span>.  And it has not appellate jurisdiction, because, since the passage of the Act of February 9, 1893, 27 Stat. 434, c. 74, establishing the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, this Court, generally speaking, and not including cases arising under the bankruptcy law, <em>Audubon v. Shufeldt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/181/575/case.html">181 U. S. 575</a></span>, cannot review the judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the District directly by appeal or writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 197 U. S. 488</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By section 716 of the Revised Statutes, this Court and the circuit and the district courts</p>\n<p>"have power to issue all writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law."</p>\n<p>By section 688, prohibition may issue "to the district courts when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," but there is no similar provision in respect of other courts.  And it has been repeatedly held, as to the circuit courts, that they have no power under section 716 to issue writs of prohibition and mandamus, except when necessary in the exercise of their existing jurisdiction.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/244/case.html#248">Bath County v. Amy,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 248; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/598/case.html#601">McClung v. Silliman,</a></span></em> 6 Wheat. 601.</p>\n<p>This is equally true of this Court -- that is to say that, in cases over which we possess neither original nor appellate jurisdiction we cannot grant prohibition or mandamus or certiorari as ancillary thereto.</p>\n<p><em>Rule discharged; petition denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
