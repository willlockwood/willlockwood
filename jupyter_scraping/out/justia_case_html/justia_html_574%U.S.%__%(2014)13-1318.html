JOHNSON, et\xc2\xa0al. <i>v.</i> CITY OF SHELBY,MISSISSIPPI</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">No. 13\xe2\x80\x931318.\xe2\x80\x83Decided November 10, 2014</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">\n            \n        Per Curiam.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n            \n        Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, worked as police officers for the city of Shelby, Mississippi.  They allege that they were fired by the city\xe2\x80\x99s board of aldermen, not for deficient performance, but because they brought to light criminal activities of one of the aldermen.  Charging violations of their\n \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights, they sought compensatory relief from the city.  Summary judgment was entered against them in the District Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to invoke\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 in their complaint.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n            \n        We summarily reverse.  Federal pleading rules call for \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2); they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See Advisory Committee Report of October 1955, reprinted in 12A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane, R. Marcus, and A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure, p. 644 (2014 ed.) (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \xe2\x80\x9care designed to discourage battles over mere form of statement\xe2\x80\x9d); 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, \xc2\xa71215, p. 172 (3d ed. 2002) (Rule 8(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cindicates that a basic objective of the rules is to avoid civil cases turning on technicalities\xe2\x80\x9d).  In particular, no heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to invoke \xc2\xa71983 expressly in order to state a claim.  See <i>Leatherman</i> v. <i>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163,\n164 (1993)\n (a federal court may not apply a standard \xe2\x80\x9cmore stringent than the usual pleading requirements of Rule 8(a)\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9ccivil rights cases alleging municipal liability\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Swierkiewicz </i>v. <i>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506,\n512 (2002)\n (imposing a \xe2\x80\x9cheight-ened pleading standard in employment discrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n            \n        The Fifth Circuit defended its requirement that complaints expressly invoke \xc2\xa71983 as \xe2\x80\x9cnot a mere pleading formality.\xe2\x80\x9d  743 F.\xc2\xa03d 59, 62 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The requirement serves a notice function, the Fifth Circuit said, because \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ertain consequences flow from claims under \xc2\xa71983, such as the unavailability of <i>respondeat superior </i>liability, which bears on the qualified immunity analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  This statement displays some confusion in the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s perception of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  No \xe2\x80\x9cqualified immunity analysis\xe2\x80\x9d is implicated here, as petitioners asserted a constitutional claim against the city only, not against any municipal officer.  See <i>Owen </i>v. <i>Independence</i>,\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622,\n638 (1980)\n (a \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipality may not assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability under \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n            \n        Our decisions in <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. </i>v. <i>Twombly</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544 (2007)\n, and <i>Ashcroft </i>v. <i>Iqbal</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662 (2009)\n, are not in point, for they concern the <i>factual </i>allegations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to dismiss.  A plaintiff, they instruct, must plead facts sufficient to show that her claim has substantive plausibility.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint was not deficient in that regard.  Petitioners stated simply, concisely, and directly events that, they alleged, entitled them to damages from the city.  Having informed the city of the factual basis for their complaint, they were required to do no more to stave off threshold dismissal for want of an adequate statementof their claim.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2) and (3), (d)(1), (e).  For clarification and to ward off further insistence on a punctiliously stated \xe2\x80\x9ctheory of the pleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners, on remand, should be accorded an opportunity to add to their complaint a citation to \xc2\xa71983.  See 5 Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa71219, at 277\xe2\x80\x93278 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe federal rules effectively abolish the restrictive theory of the pleadings doctrine, making it clear that it is unnecessary to set out a legal theory for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d (footnotes omitted)); Fed.
