Exchange Bank</em> govern the present one.</p>\n<p>We are unable to see that the judgment of the state court, declaring the dissolution of the Northern Railroad Company, rested in any manner on the act of the New York Legislature of March, 1857.  It is true that that company, the plaintiff in error in the case, both in the pleading which it filed and in argument, here assails that statute as taking property without due process of law, and impairing the obligation of contracts; but, as the defendant in error claims nothing under that statute, and as the validity or invalidity of that statute is in no way involved in the judgment of dissolution rendered by the state court, there is no question here of which this Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><em>Writ dismissed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Banks &amp; Brother\'s ed., vol. 2, p. 600.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ib.,</em> sec. 442.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ib.,</em> sec. 441.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ib.,</em> sec. 444.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>People v.
