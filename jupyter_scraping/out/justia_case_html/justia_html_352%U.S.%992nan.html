That is \'the law of the case,\' so far as that phrase has meaning, and nothing else. In the federal courts \'the law of the case\' is not a legal principle. It is a bogey that has been exposed, a ghost that has been laid, since Mr. Justice Holmes\' opinion for the Court in Messinger v. Anderson, <a href="/cases/federal/us/225/436/case.html#444">225 U.S. 436, 444</a>, 740. The misuse of the rule of practice embodied in the conception of \'law of the case,\' we had occasion to reject in United States v. United States Smelting, Refining &amp; Mining Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/186/case.html#198">339 U.S. 186, 198</a>, 544: \'It is not applicable here because when the case was first remanded, nothing was finally decided. The whole proceeding thereafter was in fieri.\' Here the only thing that was decided was, as this Court holds, rightly decided-namely, that on the facts summary judgment is precluded and the case must go to trial. </p><p> In granting the writ of certiorari, the Court sets aside all consideration by the Court of Appeals of issues other than \'that of the per se invalidity of exclusive contracts under the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.A . 1-7, 15 note).\' It is a customary practice for a Court of Appeals, in sending a case back to a District Court for trial, to give guidance on issues that may arise in the course of the trial in order to avoid needless appeals and retrials. No doubt a District Court must follow the adjudication of a Court of Appeals on reversal and remand of a case. But here the only adjudication was that the case be triea on all the relevant issues. We review judgments not talk. The basis of the reversal was a consideration by the Court of Appeals of opinions of this Court, and more particularly of our recent decisions in Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/594/case.html">345 U.S. 594</a>, and United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/377/case.html">351 U.S. 377</a>. What this Court has decided in those and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="995">Page 352 U.S. 992 , 995</a></p><p> other antitrust cases, and not any passing observations by a Court of Appeals, are the controlling directions for the District Court. </p><p> If the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case disregarded controlling rulings of this Court, the District Court is of course not bound to disregard such decisions of this Court. A District Court can hardly fail in its duty to its Court of Appeals in obeying what decisions of this Court command. On the other hand, if the Court of Appeals has expressed views that do not run counter to what this Court has decided, this Court should not direct the District Court to disregard them. Surely, this Court should not go out of its way to purport to pass on these questions at this stage of the proceedings, especially when the questions are abstract, and more particularly in such summary fashion. If we begin to grant petitions for certiorari although we agree with the judgment of a Court of Appeals because, perchance, in the opinion some dubious remarks may have been made that cannot as a matter of law control the trial of the cause (I am not implying that such is the case here), a new fecund source of business will still further swell the docket of this Court. Of course, if ever the contingency arises when a Court of Appeals challengingly or ignorantly disregards the controlling law as set forth by this Court, the means for correction here are ample and sure. </p><p> I would deny the petition.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
