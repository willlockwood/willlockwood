In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  The gravamen of the complaint was that the Board and the Department had, as a matter of official policy, compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.

Reexamination of this legislative history compels the conclusion that Congress, in 1871, would <em>not</em> have thought \xc2\xa7 1983 constitutionally infirm if it applied to local governments.  In addition, that history confirms that local governments were intended to be included </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 436 U.

Local governing bodies (and local officials sued in their official capacities) can, therefore, be sued directly under \xc2\xa7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief in those situations where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted or promulgated by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.  In addition, local governments, like every other \xc2\xa7 1983 "person," may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental "custom" even though such custom has not received formal approval through the government\'s official decisionmaking channels.

On the other hand, the language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 compel the conclusion that Congress did not intend a local government to be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor -- in other words, a local government cannot be held liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 on a <em>respondeat superior</em> theory.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 in July, 1971. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The gravamen of the complaint was that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="661">Page 436 U. S. 661</a></p><p> Board and the Department had, as a matter of official policy, compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/632/case.html">414 U. S. 632</a></span> (1974).  The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave.  Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners\' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  94 F.Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conclusion.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 436 U. S. 662</a></p><p> The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <em>LaFleur, supra.</em>  394 F.Supp. at 855.  Nonetheless plaintiffs\' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to "circumven[t]" the immunity conferred on municipalities by <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).  <em>See</em> 394 F.Supp. at 855.</p>\n<p>On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] was not a "municipality" within the meaning of <em>Monroe v. Pape, supra,</em> and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a "person" under \xc2\xa7 1983 because</p>\n<p>"it performs a vital governmental function . . . .  and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent . . . , it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be."</p>\n<p>532 F.2d 259, 263 (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were "persons" under \xc2\xa7 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  532 F.2d at 264.  Yet, because a damages award would "have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em>" a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed.  <em>Id.</em> at 265.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U.S. 1071, to consider</p>\n<p>"Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are \'persons\' within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?"</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. 8.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 436 U. S. 663</a></p><p> Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school boar [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] -- indeed, in some of which \xc2\xa7 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, provided the only basis for jurisdiction [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] -- we indicated in <em>Mt.

Pape, supra,</em> insofar as it holds that local government are wholly immune from suit under \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="664">Page 436 U. S. 664</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> we held that "Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [\xc2\xa7 1983]."  365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#187">365 U. S. 187</a></span>.  The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress\' rejection of the "Sherman amendment" to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor of \xc2\xa7 1983.  The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by <em>private</em> persons "riotously and tumultuously assembled." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe).  Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act, which is now \xc2\xa7 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by \xc2\xa7 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <em>Monroe</em> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of \xc2\xa7 1 because</p>\n<p>"\'the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that, in their judgment, Congress had no constitutional power to impose any <em>obligation</em> upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.\'"</p>\n<p>365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#190">365 U.

This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its "constitutional power . . . to impose <em>civil liability</em> on municipalities," 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#190">365 U.

S. 665</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <em>Monroe</em> incorrectly equated the "obligation" of which Representative Poland spoke with "civil liability."</p>\n<p><em>A. An Overview\n</em></p>\n<p>There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H.R. 320, a bill "to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes."  H.R. 320 contained four sections.  Section 1, now codified as 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, was the subject of only limited debate, and was passed without amendment. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the "other purpose" of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections -- not \xc2\xa7 1, now \xc2\xa7 1983 -- were the subject of almost all congressional debate, and each of these sections was amended.  The House finished its initial debates on H.R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and, one week later, the Senate also voted out a bill. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Again, debate on \xc2\xa7 1 of the bill was limited, and that section was passed as introduced. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="666">Page 436 U. S. 666</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Immediately prior to the vote on H.R. 320 in the Senate, Senator Sherman introduced his amendment. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  This was not an amendment to \xc2\xa7 1 of the bill, but was to be added as \xc2\xa7 7 at the end of the bill.  Under the Senate rules, no discussion of the amendment was allowed, and, although attempts were made to amend the amendment, it was passed as introduced.  In this form, the amendment did not place liability on municipal corporations, but made any inhabitant of a municipality liable for damage inflicted by persons "riotously and tumultuously assembled." [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The House refused to acquiesce in a number of amendments made by the Senate, including the Sherman amendment, and the respective versions of H.R. 320 were therefore sent to a conference committee.  Section 1 of the bill, however, was not a subject of this conference since, as noted, it was passed verbatim as introduced in both Houses of Congress.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 1871, the first conference committee completed its work on H.R. 320.  The main features of the conference committee draft of the Sherman amendment were these: [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  first, a cause of action was given to persons injured by</p>\n<p>"any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together . . . with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="667">Page 436 U. S. 667</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, the bill provided that the action would be against the county, city, or parish in which the riot had occurred, and that it could be maintained by either the person injured or his legal representative.  Third, unlike the amendment as proposed, the conference substitute made the government defendant liable on the judgment if it was not satisfied against individual defendants who had committed the violence.  If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected</p>\n<p>"by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof."</p>\n<p>In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property "responsible" for Ku Klux Klan damage. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="668">Page 436 U. S. 668</a></p><p> Nonetheless, there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes:  the conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House.  House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported \xc2\xa7 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters.  And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform.  This position is reflected in Representative Poland\'s statement that is quoted in <em>Monroe.</em> [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the House rejected the first conference report, a second conference was called, and it duly issued its report.  The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made</p>\n<p>"any person </p><p><a class="page-number" name="669">Page 436 U. S. 669</a></p><p> or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,"</p>\n<p>who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress, and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71986.</p>\n<p>The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee.  This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment -- on which our holding in <em>Monroe</em> was based, <em>see supra</em> at 664  -- would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights.  Because \xc2\xa71 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret \xc2\xa7 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the "persons" to whom that section applies.</p>\n<p><em>B. Debate on the First Conference Report\n</em></p>\n<p>The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States.  Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality.  Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on \xc2\xa7 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes "in the States," had also raised questions of federal power.  The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H R. 320, is the most complete. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="670">Page 436 U. S. 670</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Shellabarger began his discussion of H.R. 320 by stating that "there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored."  Globe App. 67.  There were analogies, however.  With respect to the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its Privileges or Immunities Clause, Shellabarger relied on the statement of Mr. Justice Washington in <em>Corfield v. Coryell,</em> 4 Wash.C.C. 371 (CC ED Pa. 1825), which defined the privileges protected by Art. IV:</p>\n<p>"\'What these fundamental privileges are[,] it would perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate.  They may, however, be all comprehended under the following general heads:  protection by the Government;\' -- "</p>\n<p>"<em>Mark that -- </em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>\'protection by the Government;</em> the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety. . . .\'"</p>\n<p>Globe App. 69 (emphasis added), quoting 4 Wash.C.C. at 380-381.</p>\n<p>Building on his conclusion that citizens were owed protection -- a conclusion not disputed by opponents of the Sherman amendment [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] -- Shellabarger then considered Congress\' role in providing that protection.  Here again there were precedents:  "[Congress has always assumed to enforce, as against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 436 U. S. 671</a></p><p> the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions of the Constitution.  Most of the provisions of the Constitution which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in [Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10,] relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments. . . .  These prohibitions upon political powers of the States are all of such nature that they can be, and even have been, . . . enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers.  Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States "enforced" these provisions of the Constitution.  But there are some that are not of this class.  These are where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States.</p>\n<p>"These three are:  first, that as to fugitives from justice; [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] second, that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;) [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] third, that declaring that the \'citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\' [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 436 U. S. 672</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"And, sir, every one of these -- the only provisions where it was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the constitutional provisions -- the only three where the rights or liabilities of persons in the States, as between these persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect . . . such persons."</p>\n<p>Globe App. 69-70.</p>\n<p>Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV -- the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302 the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html">Prigg v. Pennsylvania,</a></span></em> 16 Pet. 539.  There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found.  16 Pet. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html#612">41 U. S. 612</a></span>.  Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html#614">41 U. S. 614</a></span>.  Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right, and this, in turn, required a remedy, Story held it to be a "natural inference" that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html#615">41 U. S. 615</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Building on <em>Prigg,</em> Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate -- and hence constitutional -- method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen\'s federal right. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 436 U. S. 673</a></p><p> was</p>\n<p>"whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, <em>any obligations to keep the peace</em> in obedience to United States laws. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]"</p>\n<p>This he answered affirmatively, citing <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/376/case.html">Board of Comm\'rs v. Aspinwall,</a></span></em> 24 How. 376 (1861), the first of many cases [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] upholding the power of federal courts to enforce the Contract Clause against municipalities. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>House opponents of the Sherman amendment -- whose views are particularly important, since only the House voted down the amendment -- did not dispute Shellabarger\'s claim that the Fourteenth Amendment created a federal right to protection, <em>see</em> n.  <a href="#F21" name="T21">21</a> <em>supra,</em> but they argued that the local units of government upon which the amendment fastened liability were not obligated to keep the peace at state law, and further that the Federal Government could not constitutionally require local governments to create police forces, whether this requirement was levied directly, or indirectly by imposing damages for breach of the peace on municipalities.  The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair: [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>"The proposition known as the Sherman amendment . . . </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 436 U. S. 674</a></p><p> is entirely new.  It is altogether without a precedent in this country. . . .  That amendment claims the power in the General Government to go into the States of this Union and lay such obligations as it may please upon the municipalities, which are the creations of the States alone. . . . "</p>\n<p>". . .  [H]ere it is proposed not to carry into effect an obligation which rests upon the municipality, but to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 436 U. S. 675</a></p><p> create that obligation, and that is the provision I am unable to assent to.  The parallel of the hundred does not in the least meet the case.  The power that laid the obligation upon the hundred first put the duty upon the hundred that it should perform in that regard, and failing to meet the obligation which had been laid upon it, it was very proper that it should suffer damage for its neglect. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  [T]here are certain rights and duties that belong to the States, . . . there are certain powers that inhere in the State governments.  They create these municipalities, they say what their powers shall be and what their obligations shall be.  If the Government of the United States can step in and add to those obligations, may it not utterly destroy the municipality?  If it can say that it shall be liable for damages occurring from a riot, . . . where [will] its power . . . stop and what obligations . . . might [it] not lay upon a municipality. . . . "</p>\n<p>"Now, only the other day, the Supreme Court . . . decided [in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/78/113/case.html">Collector v. Day,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 113 (1871)] that there is no power in the Government of the United States, under its authority to tax, to tax the salary of a State officer.  Why?  Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect.  It was held also in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/41/539/case.html">Prigg vs. Pennsylvania</a></span></em> [16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask . . . the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty."</p>\n<p>Globe 795.</p>\n<p>Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 436 U. S. 676</a></p><p> with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment.  Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair:  first, Blair\'s analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <em>Monroe, see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#664">436 U. S. 664</a></span>, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Second, Blair\'s exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent -- albeit precedent that has not survived, <em>see Ex parte Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/339/case.html">100 U. S. 339</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/339/case.html#347">100 U. S. 347</a></span>-348 (1880); <em>Graves v. New York ex rel. O\'Keefe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/case.html">306 U. S. 466</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/466/case.html#486">306 U. S. 486</a></span> (1939) -- and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.</p>\n<p><em>Collector v. Day,</em> cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were "subject to the control of another and distinct government."  11 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/113/case.html#127">78 U. S. 127</a></span>.  Although the Court in <em>Day</em> apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing "power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/113/case.html#125">78 U. S. 125</a></span>-126; <em>cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">17 U. S. </a></span> Maryland,</em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had, in other cases, limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 436 U. S. 677</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Prigg v. Pennsylvania,</em> for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#672">436 U. S. 672</a></span>, held that Congress could not "insist that states . . . provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government."  16 Pet. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html#615">41 U. S. 615</a></span>-16. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  And Mr. Justice McLean agreed that, "[a]s a general principle," it was true "that Congress had no power to impose duties on state officers, as provided in the [Act of Feb. 12, 1793]."  Nonetheless, he wondered whether Congress might not impose "positive" duties on state officers where a clause of the Constitution, like the Fugitive Slave Clause, seemed to require affirmative government assistance, rather than restraint of government, to secure federal rights.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/41/539/case.html#664">41 U. S. 664</a></span>-665.</p>\n<p>Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by "positive" action the protection [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] owed individuals under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep the peace.  However, any such argument, largely foreclosed by <em>Prigg,</em> was made </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 436 U. S. 678</a></p><p> impossible by the Court\'s holding in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/66/case.html">Kentucky v. Dennison,</a></span></em> 24 How. 66 (1861).  There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] which implemented Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act:</p>\n<p>"[W]e think it clear that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State."</p>\n<p>24 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/66/case.html#107">65 U. S. 107</a></span>-108</p>\n<p>The rationale of <em>Dennison</em> -- that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities -- is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in <em>Collector v. Day.</em> <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#676">436 U. S. 676</a></span>.  And, as Blair indicated, municipalities, as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies, could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.  Although no one cited <em>Dennison</em> by name, the principle for which it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 436 U. S. 679</a></p><p> stands was well known to Members of Congress, [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] many of whom discussed <em>Day</em> [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>] in the mid-1860\'s which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Thus, there was ample support for Blair\'s view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson\'s choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to "destroy the government of the States."  Globe 795.</p>\n<p>If municipal liability under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson\'s choice, we might conclude, as <em>Monroe</em> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the "persons" to which that section applied.  But this is not the case.</p>\n<p>First, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 436 U. S. 680</a></p><p> liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution -- which is as far as \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act went:</p>\n<p>"I presume . . . that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality . . . , an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction.  But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever."</p>\n<p>Globe 794.</p>\n<p>Representative Burchard agreed:</p>\n<p>"[T]here is no duty imposed by the Constitution of the United States, or usually by State laws, upon a county to protect the people of that county against the commission of the offenses herein enumerated, such as the burning of buildings or any other injury to property or injury to person.  Police powers are not conferred upon counties as corporations; they are conferred upon cities that have qualified legislative power.  And so far as cities are concerned, where the equal protection required to be afforded by a State is imposed upon a city by State laws, perhaps the United States courts could enforce its performance.  But counties . . . do not have any control of the police. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 795.  <em>See also</em> the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at  <a href="#F30" name="T30">n</a> 30, <em>supra.</em>  Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it.  Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <em>Prigg,</em> this is quite understandable.  So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the "positive" government action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 436 U. S. 681</a></p><p> required to protect federal constitutional rights, and no question was raised of enlisting the States in "positive" action.  The limits of the principles announced in <em>Dennison</em> and <em>Day</em> are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history.  It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered <em>Day</em> also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalities -- an enforcement effort which included various forms of "positive" relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution\'s express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in <em>Dennison</em> or <em>Day,</em> have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary.  Since \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce \xc2\xa7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment -- a situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against municipalities </p><p><a class="page-number" name="682">Page 436 U. S. 682</a></p><p> -- there is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to \xc2\xa7 1 suits against municipalities.</p>\n<p>Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment, but who had voted for \xc2\xa7 1, confirm that the liability imposed by \xc2\xa7 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment.  Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal <em>officials</em> who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  However, for <em>Prigg-Dennison-Day</em> purposes, as Blair and others recognized, [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agents -- including corporate agents -- of the State:  both were state instrumentalities, and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power.  <em>Dennison</em> and <em>Day,</em> after all, were not suits against municipalities, but against <em>officers,</em> and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of \xc2\xa7 1 -- <em>inter alia,</em> complaining that it would be applied to state officers, <em>see</em> Globe App. 217 -- and who opposed both \xc2\xa7 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on <em>Prigg</em> grounds, agreed unequivocally that \xc2\xa7 1 was constitutional. [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="683">Page 436 U. S. 683</a></p><p> Those who voted for \xc2\xa7 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite <em>Prigg, Dennison,</em> and <em>Day.</em></p>\n<p><em>C. Debate on \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Bill\n</em></p>\n<p>From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under \xc2\xa7 1 -- "any person" -- covers more than natural persons.  An examination of the debate on \xc2\xa7 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that \xc2\xa7 1 was intended to cover legal, as well as natural, persons.</p>\n<p>Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of \xc2\xa7 1:</p>\n<p>"[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship."</p>\n<p>Globe App. 68.  By extending a remedy to all people, including whites, \xc2\xa7 1 went beyond the mischief to which the remaining sections of the 1871 Act were addressed.  Representative Shellabarger also stated without reservation that the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 controlled the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act, and that the former had been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 436 U. S. 684</a></p><p> approved by "the supreme courts of at least three States of this Union" and by Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting on circuit, who had concluded:  "<em>We have no doubt of the constitutionality of every provision of this act.\'"  Globe App. 68.  Representative Shellabarger then went on to describe how the courts would and should interpret \xc2\xa7 1:\n</em></p>\n<p>"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights.  All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed.  It would be most strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the rule of interpretation.  As has been again and again decided by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and everywhere else where there is wise judicial interpretation, the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is uniformly given in construing such statutes and constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people. . . .  Chief Justice Jay and also Story say:"</p>\n<p>"   Where a power is remedial in its nature, there is much reason to contend that it ought to be construed liberally, and it is generally adopted in the interpretation of laws."</p>\n<p>"1 story on Constitution, sec. 429."</p>\n<p>Globe App. at 68.</p>\n<p>The sentiments expressed in Representative Shellabarger\'s opening speech were echoed by Senator Edmunds, the manager of H.R. 320 in the Senate:</p>\n<p>"The first section is one that I believe nobody objects to, as defining the rights secured by the Constitution of the United States when they are assailed by any State law or under color of any State law, and it is merely carrying out the principles of the civil rights bill [of 1866], which have since become a part of the Constitution."</p>\n<p>Globe 568. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="685">Page 436 U. S. 685</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[Section 1 is] so very simple, and really reenact[s] the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 569.  And he agreed that the bill "secure[d] the rights of white men as much as of colored men."  <em>Id.</em> at 696.</p>\n<p>In both Houses, statements of the supporters of \xc2\xa7 1 corroborated that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa7 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected civil rights. [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  Moreover, since municipalities, through their official </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 436 U. S. 686</a></p><p> acts could, equally with natural persons, create the harms intended to be remedied by \xc2\xa7 1, and, further, since Congress intended \xc2\xa7 1 to be broadly construed, there is no reason to suppose that municipal corporations would have been excluded from the sweep of \xc2\xa7 1.  <em>Cf., e.g., Ex parte Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/339/case.html">100 U. S. 339</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/339/case.html#346">100 U. S. 346</a></span>-347 (1880); <em>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v.

One need not rely on this inference alone, however, for the debates show that Members of Congress understood "persons" to include municipal corporations.</p>\n<p>Representative Bingham, for example, in discussing \xc2\xa7 1 of the bill, explained that he had drafted \xc2\xa7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/243/case.html">Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore,</a></span></em> 7 Pet. 243 (1833), especially in mind.</p>\n<p>"In [that] case, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 436 U. S. 687</a></p><p> <em>city</em> had taken private property for public use, without compensation . . . , and there was no redress for the wrong. . . ."</p>\n<p>Globe App. 84 (emphasis added).  Bingham\'s further remarks clearly indicate his view that such takings by cities, as had occurred in <em>Barron,</em> would be redressable under \xc2\xa7 1 of the bill.  <em>See</em> Globe App. 85.  More generally, and as Bingham\'s remarks confirm, \xc2\xa7 1 of the bill would logically be the vehicle by which Congress provided redress for takings, since that section provided the only civil remedy for Fourteenth Amendment violations and that Amendment unequivocally prohibited uncompensated takings. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  Given this purpose, it beggars reason to suppose that Congress would have exempted municipalities from suit, insisting instead that compensation for a taking come from an officer in his individual capacity, rather than from the government unit that had the benefit of the property taken. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.  This had not always been so.  When this Court first considered the question of the status of corporations, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, denied that corporations "as such" were persons as that term was used in Art. III and the Judiciary Act of 1789.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html">Bank of the United States v. Deveaux,</a></span></em> 5 Cranch 61,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html#86">9 U. S. 86</a></span> (1809). [<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  By 1844, however, the <em>Deveaux</em> doctrine was unhesitatingly abandoned:</p>\n<p>"[A] corporation created by and doing business in a particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 436 U. S. 688</a></p><p> state, is to be deemed <em>to all intents and purposes as a person,</em> although an artificial person, . . . capable of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural person."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html">Louisville R. Co. v. Letson,</a></span></em> 2 How. 497,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html#558">43 U. S. 558</a></span> (1844) (emphasis added), discussed in Globe 752.  And only two years before the debates on the Civil Rights Act, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/118/case.html">Cowles v. Mercer County,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 118,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/118/case.html#121">74 U. S. 121</a></span> (1869), the <em>Letson</em> principle was automatically and without discussion extended to municipal corporations.  Under this doctrine, municipal corporations were routinely sued in the federal courts [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>] and this fact was well known to Members of Congress. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]</p>\n<p>That the "usual" meaning of the word "person" would extend to municipal corporations is also evidenced by an Act of Congress which had been passed only months before the Civil Rights Act was passed.  This Act provided that</p>\n<p>"in all acts hereafter passed . . . , the word \'person\' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate . . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense."</p>\n<p>Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \xc2\xa7 2, 16 Stat. 431.  Municipal corporations in 1871 were included within the phrase "bodies politic and corporate" [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>] and, accordingly, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 436 U. S. 689</a></p><p> "plain meaning" of \xc2\xa7 1 is that local government bodies were to be included within the ambit of the persons who could be sued under \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act.  Indeed, a Circuit Judge, writing in 1873 in what is apparently the first reported case under \xc2\xa7 1, read the Dictionary Act in precisely this way in a case involving a corporate plaintiff and a municipal defendant. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]  <em>See Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park,</em> 18 F.Cas. 393, 394 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873). [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 436 U. S. 690</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress did intend municipalities and other local government units to be included among those persons to whom \xc2\xa7 1983 applies. [<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]  Local governing bodies, [<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>] therefore, can be sued directly under \xc2\xa7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\'s officers.  Moreover, although the touchstone of the \xc2\xa7 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other \xc2\xa7 1983 "person," by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 436 U. S. 691</a></p><p> deprivations visited pursuant to governmental "custom" even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\'s official decisionmaking channels.  As Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said in <em>Adickes v. H. Kress &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/144/case.html">398 U. S. 144</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/144/case.html#167">398 U. S. 167</a></span>-168 (1970):</p>\n<p>"Congress included customs and usages [in \xc2\xa7 1983] because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials. . . .   Although not authorized by written law, such practices of state officials could well be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a \'custom or usage\' with the force of law. [<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the language of \xc2\xa7 1983, read against the background of the same legislative history, compels the conclusion that Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.  In particular, we conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable <em>solely</em> because it employs a tortfeasor -- or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 on a <em>respondeat superior</em> theory.</p>\n<p>We begin with the language of \xc2\xa7 1983 as originally passed:</p>\n<p>"<em>[A]ny person who,</em> under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, <em>shall subject, or cause to be subjected,</em> any person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 436 U. S. 692</a></p><p> law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . ."</p>\n<p>17 Stat. 13 (emphasis added).  The italicized language plainly imposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, "causes" an employee to violate another\'s constitutional rights.  At the same time, that language cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.  Indeed, the fact that Congress did specifically provide that A\'s tort. became B\'s liability if B "caused" A to subject another to a tort suggests that Congress did not intend \xc2\xa7 1983 liability to attach where such causation was absent. [<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>]  <em>See Rizzo v. Goode,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/362/case.html">423 U.

S. 693</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Equally important, creation of a federal law of <em>respondeat superior</em> would have raised all the constitutional problems associated with the obligation to keep the peace, an obligation Congress chose not to impose because it thought imposition of such an obligation unconstitutional.  To this day, there is disagreement about the basis for imposing liability on an employer for the torts of an employee when the sole nexus between the employer and the tort is the fact of the employer-employee relationship.  <em>See</em> W. Prosser, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 69, p. 459 (4th ed.1971).  Nonetheless, two justifications tend to stand out.  First is the common sense notion that, no matter how blameless an employer appears to be in an individual case, accidents might nonetheless be reduced if employers had to bear the cost of accidents.  <em>See, e.g., ibid.;</em> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts, \xc2\xa7 26.3, pp. 1368-1369 (1956).  Second is the argument that the cost of accidents should be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="694">Page 436 U. S. 694</a></p><p> spread to the community as a whole on an insurance theory.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> \xc2\xa7 6.5; Prosser, <em>supra</em> at 459. [<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]</p>\n<p>The first justification is of the same sort that was offered for statutes like the Sherman amendment:</p>\n<p>"The obligation to make compensation for injury resulting from riot is by arbitrary enactment of statutes, affirmatory law, and the reason of passing the statute is to secure a more perfect police regulation."</p>\n<p>Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).  This justification was obviously insufficient to sustain the amendment against perceived constitutional difficulties, and there is no reason to suppose that a more general liability imposed for a similar reason would have been thought less constitutionally objectionable.  The second justification was similarly put forward as a justification for the Sherman amendment:  "we do not look upon [the Sherman amendment] as a punishment. . . .   It is a mutual insurance."  <em>Id.</em> at 792 (Rep. Butler).  Again, this justification was insufficient to sustain the amendment.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be sued under \xc2\xa7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.  Instead, it is when execution of a government\'s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government, as an entity, is responsible under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, <em>see supra</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 436 U. S. 695</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#660">436 U. S. 660</a></span>-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below.  In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under \xc2\xa7 1983 may be.  We have attempted only to sketch so much of the \xc2\xa7 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although we have stated that <em>stare decisis</em> has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, <em>see, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html">415 U.

S. 671</a></span>, and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied <em>stare decisis</em> mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.  <em>See, e.g., Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/36/case.html">433 U.

Nor is this a case where we should "place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court\'s own error."  <em>Girouard v.

Pape,</em> insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under \xc2\xa7 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  <em>See, e.g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park,</em> 18 F.Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); <em>City of Manchester v. Leiby,</em> 117 F.2d 661 (CA1 1941); <em>Hannan v. City of Haverhill,</em> 120 F.2d 87 (CA1 1941); <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html">319 U. S. 157</a></span> (1943); <em>Holmes v. Atlanta,</em> 350 U.S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in \xc2\xa7 1983 suits. [<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  Moreover, the constitutional defect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 436 U. S. 696</a></p><p> that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#673">436 U. S. 673</a></span>-682.  For this reason, our cases -- decided both before and after <em>Monroe, see</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra</em> -- holding school boards liable in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions are inconsistent with <em>Monroe,</em> especially as <em>Monroe\'s</em> immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in <em>City of Kenosha v. Bruno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/507/case.html">412 U. S. 507</a></span> (1973). [<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>]  And although, in many of these cases, jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not "disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years."  <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/294/case.html">370 U.

("Those decisions are not cited as authority . . . , but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench").  Thus, while we have reaffirmed <em>Monroe</em> without further examination on three occasions, [<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>] it can scarcely be said that <em>Monroe</em> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.</p>\n<p>Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <em>Monroe</em> cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards. [<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]  Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often </p><p><a class="page-number" name="697">Page 436 U. S. 697</a></p><p> defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been \xc2\xa7 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal court decrees. [<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]  Finally, in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="698">Page 436 U. S. 698</a></p><p> regard to the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in \xc2\xa7 1983 suits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="699">Page 436 U. S. 699</a></p><p> to obtain attorney\'s fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated:</p>\n<p>"[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials.  In such cases, it is intended that the attorneys\' fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, <em>in his official capacity,</em> from funds of his agency or under his control, or <em>from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party</em>)."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

Far from showing that Congress has relied on <em>Monroe,</em> therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <em>Monroe</em> to school boards, and has attempted to allow awards of attorney\'s fees against local governments even though <em>Monroe,</em> <em>City of Kenosha v. Bruno,</em> and <em>Aldinger v. Howard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/case.html">427 U. S. 1</a></span> (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.

Indeed, municipalities simply cannot "arrange their affairs" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely, since injunctive suits against local officials under \xc2\xa7 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <em>Monroe</em> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.</p>\n<p>Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <em>Monroe</em> [<a href="#F65" name="T65">Footnote 65</a>] -- "that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<em>Monroe</em>] misapprehended the meaning of the [section]," 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#192">365 U. S. 192</a></span> (concurring opinion) -- the overruling of <em>Monroe</em> insofar as it holds that local governments are not "persons" who may be defendants in \xc2\xa7 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress\' view of the law, were \xc2\xa7 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.  Yet everyone -- proponents and opponents alike -- knew \xc2\xa7 1983 would be applied to state officers, and nonetheless stated that \xc2\xa7 1983 was constitutional.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#680">436 U. S. 680</a></span>-682.  And, moreover, there can be no doubt that \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected </p><p><a class="page-number" name="701">Page 436 U. S. 701</a></p><p> rights.  Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that \xc2\xa7 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation -- which simply is not present -- there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the "persons" covered by \xc2\xa7 1.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that <em>stare decisis</em> does not bar our overruling of <em>Monroe</em> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.

Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position; he thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection.  That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc.  He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the States the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated.  <em>See id.</em> at 791.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the Sherman amendment in the Senate agreed with Blair that Congress had no power to pass the Sherman amendment because it fell outside limits on national power implicit in the federal structure of the Constitution and recognized in, <em>e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/113/case.html">78 U. S. </a></span> Day,</em> 11 Wall. 113 (1871).  However, the Senate opponent focused not on the amendment\'s attempt to obligate municipalities to keep the peace, but on the lien created by the amendment, which ran against all money and property of a defendant municipality, including property held for public purposes, such as jails or courthouses.  Opponents argued that such a lien, once entered, would have the effect of making it impossible for the municipality to function, since no one would trade with it.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Globe 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <em>id.</em> at 763 (Sen. Casserly).  Moreover, everyone knew that sound policy prevented execution against public property, since this, too, was needed if local government was to survive.  <em>See, e.g., ibid.</em> <em>See also Meriwether v.

Instead, the distinction must have been that a violation of the Constitution was the predicate for "positive" relief in the Contract Clause cases, whereas the Sherman amendment imposed damages without regard to whether a local government was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#668">436 U.

S. 191</a></span>.  A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.</p>\n<p>There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of "person," but Senator Trumbull, the Act\'s sponsor, discussed the phrase "words importing the masculine gender <em>may</em> be applied to females," (emphasis added), which immediately precedes the definition of "person," and stated:</p>\n<p>"The only object [of the Act] is to get rid of a great deal of verbosity in our statutes by providing that, when the word \'he\' is used it <em>shall</em> include females as well as males."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871) (emphasis added).  Thus, in Trumbull\'s view, the word "may" meant "shall."  Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is also required for it to perform its intended function -- to be a guide to "rules of construction" of Acts of Congress.  <em>See ibid.</em> (remarks of Sen. Trumbull).  Were the defined words "allowable, [but] not mandatory" constructions, as <em>Monroe</em> suggests, there would be no "rules" at all.  Instead, Congress must have intended the definitions of the Act to apply across the board, except where the Act, by its terms, called for a deviation from this practice -- "[where] the context shows that [defined] words were to be used in a more limited sense."  Certainly this is how the <em>Northwestern Fertilizing</em> court viewed the matter.  Since there is nothing in the "context" of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word "person," the language of that section should <em>prima facie</em> be construed to include "bodies politic" among the entities that could be sued.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T54" name="F54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>There is certainly no constitutional impediment to municipal liability.</p>\n<p>"The Tenth Amendment\'s reservation of nondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct,enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Milliken v.

S. 369</a></span> (1940):</p>\n<p>"It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of \'laws\' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it.  Settled state practice . . . can establish what is state law.  The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution.  Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T57" name="F57">Footnote 57</a>]</p>\n<p>Support for such a conclusion can be found in the legislative history.  As we have indicated, there is virtually no discussion of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Civil Rights Act.  Again, however Congress\' treatment of the Sherman amendment gives a clue to whether it would have desired to impose <em>respondeat superior</em> liability.</p>\n<p>The primary constitutional justification for the Sherman amendment was that it was a necessary and proper remedy for the failure of localities to protect citizens as the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#670">436 U. S. 670</a></span>-673.  And according to Sherman, Shellabarger, and Edmunds, the amendment came into play only when a locality was at fault or had knowingly neglected its duty to provide protection.  <em>See</em> Globe 761 (Sen. Sherman); <em>id.</em> at 756 (Sen. Edmunds); <em>id.</em> at 751-752 (Rep. Shellabarger).  But other proponents of the amendment apparently viewed it as a form of vicarious liability for the unlawful acts of the citizens of the locality.  <em>See id.</em> at 792 (Rep. Butler).  And whether intended or not, the amendment as drafted did impose a species of vicarious liability on municipalities, since it could be construed to impose liability even if a municipality did not know of an impending or ensuing riot or did not have the wherewithal to do anything about it.  Indeed, the amendment held a municipality liable even if it had done everything in its power to curb the riot.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#668">436 U. S. 668</a></span>; Globe 761 (Sen. Stevenson); <em>id.</em> at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <em>id.</em> at 788 (Rep. Kerr); <em>id.</em> at 791 (Rep. Willard).  While the first conference substitute was rejected principally on constitutional grounds, <em>see id.</em> at 804 (Rep. Poland), it is plain from the text of the second conference substitute -- which limited liability to those who, having the power to intervene against Ku Klux Klan violence, "neglect[ed] or refuse[d] so to do," <em>see</em> Appendix to this opinion, <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#704">436 U. S. 704</a></span>, and which was enacted as \xc2\xa7 6 of the 1871 Act and is now codified as 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1986 -- that Congress also rejected those elements of vicarious liability contained in the first conference substitute even while accepting the basic principle that the inhabitants of a community were bound to provide protection against the Ku Klux Klan.  Strictly speaking, of course, the fact that Congress refused to impose vicarious liability for the wrongs of a few private citizens does not conclusively establish that it would similarly have refused to impose vicarious liability for the torts of a municipality\'s employees.  Nonetheless, when Congress\' rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in \xc2\xa7 1983 which can easily be construed t.o create <em>respondeat superior</em> liability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T58" name="F58">Footnote 58</a>]</p>\n<p>A third justification, often cited but which, on examination, is apparently insufficient to justify the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, see, e.g.,</em> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, \xc2\xa7 26.3, is that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor.  By our decision in <em>Rizzo v. Goode,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/362/case.html">423 U.

In \xc2\xa7 718 of the Act, 86 Stat. 369, 20 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1617 (1976 ed.), Congress gave its explicit approval to the institution of federal desegregation suits against school boards -- presumably under \xc2\xa7 1983.  Section 718 provides:</p>\n<p>"Upon the entry of a final order <em>by a court of the United States against a local educational agency</em> . . . for discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in violation of . . . the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . . , the court . . . may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\'s fee as part of the costs."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Two years later, in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, Congress found that</p>\n<p>"the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required <em>local educational agencies</em> to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources. . . ."</p>\n<p>20 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1702(a)(3) (1976 ed.).

Focusing new light on 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="705">Page 436 U. S. 705</a></p><p> the 1871 measure.  But <em>Monroe</em> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entities -- even when they act pursuant to express authorization.  The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <em>Monroe</em> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court\'s opinion today.  Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] the <em>Monroe</em> Court treated the 42d Congress\' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury.  That reading, in light of today\'s thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly "misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision," <em>Monroe, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#192">365 U. S. 192</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring).  In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict </p><p><a class="page-number" name="706">Page 436 U. S. 706</a></p><p> with the command of the Due Process Clause, <em>cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/632/case.html">414 U. S. 632</a></span> (1974), the Court decides "not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late," <em>Henslee v. Union Planters Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/595/case.html">335 U. S. 595</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/595/case.html#600">335 U. S. 600</a></span> (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of "riot act" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness.  As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 legislation -- now \xc2\xa7 1983 -- that "any person" acting "under color of" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that "subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person . . . to the deprivation of any" federal constitutional or statutory right.  Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports <em>Monroe\'s</em> observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally "antagonistic," 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#191">365 U. S. 191</a></span>, to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation.  Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal\'s unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of \xc2\xa7 1983 judgment lienors.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#673">436 U. S. 673</a></span>-674, n. 30.  The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment\'s attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#673">436 U.

No conduct of government comes more clearly within the "under color of" state law language of \xc2\xa7 1983.  It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be exclusively liable for resulting constitutional injury. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>As elaborated in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U. S. </a></span> the rejection of the Sherman amendment can best be understood not as evidence of Congress\' acceptance of a rule of absolute municipal immunity, but as a limitation of the statutory ambit to actual wrongdoers, <em>i.e.,</em> a rejection of <em>respondeat superior</em> or any other principle of vicarious liability.  <em>Cf.</em> Levin, The Section 1983 Municipal Immunity Doctrine, 65 Geo.L.J. 1483, 1531-1535 (1977).  Thus, it has been clear that a public official may be held liable in damages when his actions are found to violate a constitutional right and there is no qualified immunity, <em>see Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U. S. 308</a></span> (1975); <em>Procunier v. Navarette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/555/case.html">434 U. S. 555</a></span> (1978).  Today the Court recognizes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 436 U. S. 708</a></p><p> that this principle also applies to a local government when implementation of its official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court traditionally has been hesitant to overrule prior constructions of statutes or interpretations of common law rules.  "<em>Stare decisis</em> is usually the wise policy," <em>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/393/case.html">285 U.

S. 406</a></span> (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but this cautionary principle must give way to countervailing considerations in appropriate circumstances. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  I concur in the Court\'s view that this is not a case where we should "place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court\'s own error."  <em>Girouard v.

On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not "persons" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983.  On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to \xc2\xa7 1983 suits.</p>\n<p>In <em>Monroe</em> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court -- whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies.</p>\n<p>"The theory of the complaint [in <em>Monroe</em> was] that, under the circumstances [t]here alleged, the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers by virtue of <em>respondeat superior.</em>"</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 436 U.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>This line of cases -- from <em>Monroe</em> to <em>Kenosha</em> -- is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 436 U.

If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <em>Monroe,</em> grave doubt would be cast upon the Court\'s exercise of \xc2\xa7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#663">436 U.

Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, <em>see, e.g., Green v.

Thus, the exercise of \xc2\xa7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding.  Indeed, it predated <em>Monroe.</em></p>\n<p>Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which "may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \xc2\xa7 1983 or <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U.

[<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Moreover, the rationale of <em>Kenosha</em> would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under \xc2\xa7 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government.  The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of <em>Ex parte Young</em> into \xc2\xa7 1983, 532 F.2d 259, 264-266 (CA2 1976).  That approach, however, would create tension with <em>Kenosha,</em> because it would require "a bifurcated application" of "the generic word <em>person\' in \xc2\xa7 1983" to public officials "depending on the nature of the relief sought against them."  412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/507/case.html#513">412 U. S. 513</a></span>.  A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a "person" for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-"person" in an action for damages.  The Court\'s holding avoids this difficulty.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U.

In light of the Court\'s persuasive reexamination in today\'s decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from \xc2\xa7 1983 "an explicit congressional declaration" against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution.  Rather than constitutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.

The dispute that divided the Court was over whether a complaint alleging police misconduct in violation of state law, for which state judicial remedies were available, stated a \xc2\xa7 1983 claim in light of the statutory requirement that the conduct working injury be "under color of" state law.  <em>Compare</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#172">365 U.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#718">436 U. S. 718</a></span>; <em>cf.</em> O. Holmes, The Common Law 36 (1881).  But, at the same time, the law has recognized the necessity of change, lest rules "simply persis[t] from blind imitation of the past."  Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.L.Rev. 457, 469 (1897).  Any overruling of prior precedent, whether of a constitutional decision or otherwise, disserves to some extent the value of certainty.  But I think we owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.  That is the premise of the canon of interpretation that language in a decision not necessary to the holding may be accorded less weight in subsequent cases.  I also would recognize the fact that, until this case, the Court has not had to confront squarely the consequences of holding \xc2\xa7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.</p>\n<p>Of course, the mere fact that an issue was not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

But the Court\'s recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in <em>Marbury.</em>  And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the <em>Marbury</em> holding.  In <em>Monroe,</em> on the other hand, the Court\'s rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner.  The language in <em>Monroe</em> cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding \xc2\xa7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.  It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today\'s reexamination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Aldinger v.

Of all its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, \xc2\xa7 2, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  The 1976 Act provides that attorney\'s fees may be awarded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="717">Page 436 U. S. 717</a></p><p> to the prevailing party "[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title."  There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections; it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney\'s fees.  As the Court admits, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#699">436 U. S. 699</a></span>, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed "whether or not the agency or government is a named party," S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well known holding of <em>Monroe.</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s assertion that municipalities have no right to act "on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#700">436 U. S. 700</a></span>, is simply beside the point.  Since <em>Monroe,</em> municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers\' failure to predict this Court\'s recognition of new constitutional rights.  No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of <em>stare decisis.</em>  To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL\'s view that "[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#709">436 U. S. 709</a></span> n. 6.  Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="718">Page 436 U. S. 718</a></p><p> obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind.  To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v. Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), forward, in which the explicit ground of decision "was never actually briefed or argued," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#708">436 U. S. 708</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law.  Indeed, in <em>Marbury</em> itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicants -- which, unlike the arguments in <em>Monroe,</em> is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see it -- devotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress.  Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance.  1 Cranch at 153-154.  More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother POWELL\'s analysis.  In <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html">338 U.

S. 646</a></span> n. 3.  That <em>Marbury, Mapp,</em> and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary byproduct of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present "all the relevant considerations."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#709">436 U. S. 709</a></span> n. 6 (POWELL, J., concurring).  While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress.  That intent was first expounded in <em>Monroe,</em> and it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="719">Page 436 U. S. 719</a></p><p> has been followed consistently ever since.  This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference.  Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <em>Monroe.</em>  124 Cong.Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978).  In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of <em>stare decisis</em> require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings.  <em>Monroe</em> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated "beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<em>Monroe</em>] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision."  <em>Monroe,</em> 365 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#192">365 U. S. 192</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring).  The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 1, it intended to impose that liability.  I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Any analysis of the meaning of the word "person" in \xc2\xa7 1983, which was originally enacted as \xc2\xa7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act.  The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided:</p>\n<p>"That in all acts hereafter passed . . . the word \'person\' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate . . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense. . . ."</p>\n<p>Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \xc2\xa7 2, 16 Stat. 431.  The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word "person" where the context suggests a more limited reach.  Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="720">Page 436 U. S. 720</a></p><p> in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person.  Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act\'s provision that "words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females," might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women.  Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).</p>\n<p>There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted \xc2\xa7 1983 may well have intended the word "person" "to be used in a more limited sense," as <em>Monroe</em> concluded.  It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html">Louisville R. Co. v. Letson,</a></span></em> 2 How. 497, 558 (1844), and municipal corporations, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/118/case.html">Cowles v. Mercer County,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 118, 121 (1869), were "citizens" of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III.  Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/168/case.html">Paul v. Virginia,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 168 (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be "citizens" within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S.Const., Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2.  Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts.  Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that \xc2\xa7 1 "was so very simple and really reenact[ed] the Constitution."  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds).  At the time \xc2\xa7 1983 was enacted, the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a "citizen" nor a "person."  <em>Insurance Co. v. New Orleans,</em> 13 F.Cas. 67 (No. 7,052) (CC La. 1870).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the state courts did not speak with a single voice with regard to the tort liability of municipal corporations.  Although many Members of Congress represented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="721">Page 436 U. S. 721</a></p><p> States which had retained absolute municipal tort immunity, <em>see, e.g., Irvine v. Town of Greenwood,</em> 89 S.C. 511, 72 S.E. 228 (1911) (collecting earlier cases), other States had adopted the currently predominant distinction imposing liability for proprietary acts, <em>see generally</em> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 29.6 (1956), as early as 1842, <em>Bailey v. Mayor of City of New York,</em> 3 Hill 531 (N.Y. 1842).  Nevertheless, no state court had ever held that municipal corporations were always liable in tort in precisely the same manner as other persons.</p>\n<p>The general remarks from the floor on the liberal purposes of \xc2\xa7 1 offer no explicit guidance as to the parties against whom the remedy could be enforced.  As the Court concedes, only Representative Bingham raised a concern which could be satisfied only by relief against governmental bodies.  Yet he never directly related this concern to \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act.  Indeed, Bingham stated at the outset, "I do not propose now to discuss the provisions of the bill in detail," Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 82 (1871), and, true to his word, he launched into an extended discourse on the beneficent purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.  While Bingham clearly stated that Congress could "provide that no citizen in any State shall be deprived of his property by State law or the judgment of a State court without just compensation therefor," <em>id.</em> at 85, he never suggested that such a power was exercised in \xc2\xa7 1. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="722">Page 436 U. S. 722</a></p><p> Finally; while Bingham has often been advanced as the chief expositor of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Duncan v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/case.html">391 U. S. 145</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/case.html#165">391 U. S. 165</a></span> (1968) (Black, J., concurring); <em>Adamson v.

S. 64</a></span> (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Thus, it ought not lightly to be presumed, as the Court does today, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U. S. 690</a></span> n. 53, that \xc2\xa7 1983 "should <em>prima facie</em> be construed to include <em>bodies politic\' among the entities that could be sued."  Neither the Dictionary Act, the ambivalent state of judicial decisions, nor the floor debate \xef\xbf\xbd \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act gives any indication that any Member of Congress had any inkling that \xc2\xa7 1 could be used to impose liability on municipalities.  Although Senator Thurman, as the Court emphasizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#686">436 U. S. 686</a></span> n. 45, expressed his belief that the terms of \xc2\xa7 1 "are as comprehensive as can be used," Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871), an examination of his lengthy remarks demonstrates that it never occurred to him that \xc2\xa7 1 did impose or could have imposed any liability upon municipal corporations.  In an extended parade of horribles, this "old Roman," who was one of the Act\'s most implacable opponents, suggested that state legislatures, Members of Congress, and state judges might be held liable under the Act.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If, at that point in the debate, he had any idea that \xc2\xa7 1 was designed to impose tort liability upon cities and counties, he would surely have raised an additional outraged objection.  Only once was that possibility placed squarely before the Congress -- in its consideration of the Sherman amendment -- and the Congress squarely rejected it.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court is probably correct that the rejection of the Sherman amendment does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Congress intended municipalities to be immune from liability under all circumstances.  Nevertheless, it cannot be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="723">Page 436 U. S. 723</a></p><p> denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress\' understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context.  Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort:</p>\n<p>"Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can we levy on the courthouse and sell it?  So this section provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action <em>ex delicto,</em> where the county has never entered into any contract, where the State has never authorized the county to assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability upon it.  It is in my opinion simply absurd."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 799 (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented.  Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended \xc2\xa7 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of "person," and thus the reasoning of <em>Monroe</em> on this point is subject to challenge.  The meaning of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <em>Monroe,</em> and it may well be that, on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates, a conclusion contrary to the <em>Monroe</em> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago.  But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 436 U. S. 724</a></p><p> Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on \xc2\xa7 1 that the word "person" was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing "beyond doubt" that this Court, in <em>Monroe,</em> "misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision."  Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <em>Monroe</em> do not end the inquiry as to <em>stare decisis;</em> they merely begin it.  I would adhere to the holding of <em>Monroe</em> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The decision in <em>Monroe v. Pape</em> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years.  Using \xc2\xa7 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <em>Monroe</em> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials\' failure to predict the course of this Court\'s constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today\'s removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law.  It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today\'s decision.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>As we pointed out in <em>Mt.

As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F.2d 259, 264-266, such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \xc2\xa7 1983 or <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a></span> (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages.  Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of <em>Monroe,</em> my Brother POWELL relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that "the exercise of \xc2\xa7 1983 jurisdiction . . . [was] perhaps not premised on considered holdings."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#711">436 U.

Since the Court today abandons the holding of <em>Monroe</em> chiefly on the strength of Bingham\'s arguments, it is indeed anomalous that \xc2\xa7 1983 will provide relief only when a local government, not the State itself, seizes private property.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#690">436 U.
