On September 25, the petitioner filed a replication in which he "joins issue with the defendants upon the return and answer filed to the petition for the writ of prohibition," and upon a hearing in general term the court entered the following judgment:</p>\n<p>"The court being of opinion that it has not jurisdiction of the matter complained of, it is therefore considered that the petition be and it is hereby dismissed with costs, to be taxed by the clerk."</p>\n<p>The petitioner in open court prayed and was allowed an appeal from that judgment, and also sued out a writ of error to reverse it.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1910885">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Smith v.

JUSTICE GRAY delivered the opinion of the Court.  After stating the facts in the language reported above, he continued:</p>\n<p>The final judgment or decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in any case in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum of $5,000, may be reviewed and reversed or affirmed in this Court upon writ of error, if the judgment is at law, or upon appeal, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 116 U.

D.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 846, 847; Act March 3, 1885, c. 366; 23 Stat. 443.</p>\n<p>The objection, founded on <em>Kurtz v. Moffitt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/487/case.html">115 U. S. 487</a></span>, and cases there cited, that this Court has no appellate jurisdiction of the present case, because there is nothing in dispute the value of which can be estimated in money, cannot be sustained.  The matter in dispute is whether the petitioner is subject to a prosecution which may end in a sentence dismissing him from the service, and depriving him of a salary, as paymaster general during the residue of his term as such, and as pay inspector afterwards, which in less than two years would exceed the sum of $5,000.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1556, 1565, 1624, arts. 8, 22, 48, 53.  The case cannot be distinguished in principle from those in which it has been held that a judgment awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus to admit one to an office, or a judgment of ouster from an office, might be reviewed by this Court upon writ of error, if the salary during the term of the office would exceed the sum named in the statute defining its appellate jurisdiction.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/20/534/case.html">Columbian Ins. Co. v. Wheelright,</a></span></em> 7 Wheat. 534; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/63/174/case.html">United States v. Addison,</a></span></em> 22 How. 174.</p>\n<p>It is often said that the granting or refusing of a writ of prohibition is discretionary, and therefore not the subject of a writ of error.  That may be true where there is another legal remedy by appeal or otherwise, or where the question of the jurisdiction of the court whose action is sought to be prohibited is doubtful, or depends on facts which are not made matter of record, or where a stranger, as he may in England, applies for the writ of prohibition.  But where that court has clearly no jurisdiction of the suit or prosecution instituted before it, and the defendant therein has objected to its jurisdiction at the outset, and has no other remedy, he is entitled to a writ of prohibition as matter of right, and a refusal to grant it, where all the proceedings appear of record, may be reviewed on error.  This is the clear result of the modern English decisions, in which the law concerning writs of prohibition has been more fully discussed and explained than in the older authorities.  <em>In</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 116 U. S. 174</a></p><p> <em>re Forster,</em> 4 B. &amp; S. 187, 199; <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of London v. Cox,</em> L.R. 2 H.L. 239, 280; <em>Worthington v. Jeffries,</em> L.R. 10 C.P. 379, 380; <em>Chambers v. Green,</em> L.R. 20 Eq. 552, 555.  <em><span class="l-seealso">See also <a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v. City Council of Charleston,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 449, reversing on error <em>S.C.,</em> Harper 340.</p>\n<p>The petitioner in the present case objected at the very beginning of the proceedings before the court-martial, that it had no jurisdiction to try him on the charges laid before it, and the facts upon which his objection to its jurisdiction are based, as well as the final judgment dismissing his petition for a writ of prohibition, appear of record.  The case is therefore within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia having both common law and equity powers, it would seem that the proceedings in this case must be considered as on the common law side of that court, and that the proper mode of invoking the appellate jurisdiction of this Court is by writ of error.  In England, from long before the Declaration of Independence, writs of prohibition have usually issued from the courts of common law, and do not appear to have issued from a court of chancery in any case in which a court of law might issue them, except during vacation, when the courts of common law were not open.  2 Hale, P.C. 147; Lord Holt, in <em>Blackborough v. Davis,</em> 1 P. Wms. 41, 43; <em>Anon.,</em> 1 P. Wms. 476; <em>Montgomery v. Blair,</em> 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 136; <em>In re Foster,</em> 24 Beavan 428; <em>In re Bateman,</em> L.R. 9 Eq. 660.  And in this country, so far as we are informed, these writs have never been issued but by a court of common law jurisdiction.  But as the petitioner has both taken an appeal and sued out a writ of error, it is immaterial which is the proper form of bringing up the case.</p>\n<p>The hearing below was upon a rule to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue as prayed for.  The question at that hearing was the general question whether the court should issue a writ of prohibition.  That question could not, at that stage of the case, be narrowed or divided by the pleadings filed by the defendants.  The judgment, as recorded, although it contains a statement of the court\'s "opinion that it has no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 116 U. S. 175</a></p><p> jurisdiction of the matter complained of," is a general judgment dismissing the petition, with costs, which could not have been awarded upon a judgment of dismissal for want of jurisdiction.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/73/247/case.html">Mayor v. Cooper,</a></span></em> 6 Wall. 247; <em>Elk v. Wilkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/94/case.html">112 U. S. 94</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/94/case.html#98">112 U. S. 98</a></span>.  The writ of error brings in question the judgment, not the opinion, of the court below.  If the petition was rightly dismissed for any reason, whether because that court had no jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition to a court-martial, or because the court-martial had jurisdiction of the charges against the petitioner, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p>It is argued in behalf of the petitioner that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia is authorized to issue writs of prohibition on the same grounds on which it was held in <em>United States v.

Gould,</em> 2 H.Bl. 69, under an article of war subjecting to punishment at the discretion of a court-martial any officer or soldier convicted of "having advised or pursuaded any other officer or soldier to desert his majesty\'s service," the petitioner "must," as was said by Chief Justice Marshall been charged with "having advised and persuaded" two soldiers in the Coldstream regiment of foot guards</p>\n<p>"to desert his majesty\'s service, and to enlist into the service of the East India Company, knowing them at the same time to belong to the said regiment of foot guards."</p>\n<p>The sentence did not in terms find him guilty of having advised or persuaded them to desert the King\'s service, but merely stated that the court-martial was of opinion that he was "guilty of having promoted and having been instrumental toward the enlisting of" the two soldiers</p>\n<p>"into the service of the East India Company, knowing them at the said time to belong to the said regiment of foot guards, and, deeming this crime to be precisely of the same nature with that which is set forth in the charge, and to differ only in this, that it is rather inferior, but in a very slight degree, in point of aggravation,"</p>\n<p>adjudged him to be punished.  It was argued for the petitioner that he had not been found guilty of advising or persuading to desert, which was the substance of the offense charged, but at the utmost, of promoting and aiding in the enlistment into the service of the East India Company, which of itself was no offense under the Articles of War or the Mutiny Act.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 116 U.

But if, by the nicety which they used in penning the sentence, that sentence were to be invalidated, it could not be by a prohibition, whatever it might be by a review, or by an appeal.  The most that can be made of it is an error in the proceedings; but we cannot prohibit upon that account.  The sentence in the case of an unfortunate admiral <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/us/116/167/case.html">*</a></span> was certainly an inaccurate one.  The question there was whether the court had not mistaken the law, yet a prohibition was not thought of.  But it is unnecessary to discuss the sentence further; it would be extremely absurd to comment upon it as if it was a conviction before magistrates, which was to discussed in a court where that conviction could be reviewed."</p>\n<p>2 H.Bl. 107.</p>\n<p>Of questions not depending upon the construction of the statutes, but upon unwritten military law or usage, within the jurisdiction of courts-martial, military or naval officers, from their training and experience in the service, are more competent judges than the courts of common law.  This is nowhere better stated than by Mr. Justice Perry in the Supreme Court of Bowbay, saying:</p>\n<p>"And the principle of the noninterference of the courts of law with the procedure of courts-martial is clear and obvious.  The groundwork of the jurisdiction, and the extent of the powers of courts-martial, are to be found in the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War, and upon all questions arising upon these her majesty\'s judges are competent to decide; but the Mutiny Act and Articles of War do not alone constitute the Military Code, for they are, for the most part, silent upon all the relates to the procedure of the military tribunals to be erected under them.  Now, this procedure is founded upon the usages and customs of war, upon the regulations issued by the sovereign, and upon old practice in the army, as to all which points common law judges have no opportunity, either from their law books or from the course of their experience, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="179">Page 116 U. S. 179</a></p><p> to inform themselves.  It would therefore be most illogical, to say nothing of the impediments to military discipline which would thereby be interposed, to apply to the procedure of courts-martial those rules which are applicable to another and different course of practice."</p>\n<p><em>Porret\'s Case,</em> Perry\'s Orient Cases 414, 419.  So in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/19/case.html">Martin v.

S. 13</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is argued for the petitioner that his office of Paymaster General and chief of a bureau in the Department of the Navy, under a distinct appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate, is a separate office of a purely civil character; that the duties of that office are not military, but civil only, relating to the business of the Navy Department, performed under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, who is exclusively a civil officer, and, in case of a vacancy in the office of chief of bureau, or of his absence, to be performed by a deputy or chief clerk, who is also exclusively a civil officer, and therefore that a violation of those duties can be prosecuted in the civil courts only, and not by court-martial.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is argued that the petitioner is an officer of the navy; that no one but an officer of the navy of a certain rank can be appointed to the office of chief of bureau and paymaster general; that the petitioner\'s appointment to that office gives him the relative rank of commodore in the navy; that the duties of paymaster general are naval duties performed by a naval officer, and therefore that any violation of those duties is triable and punishable by naval court-martial.</p>\n<p>The charges on which the court-martial was ordered to try the petitioner are drawn up in two aspects.  The leading charge is for "scandalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals," and various acts done by the petitioner as paymaster general are set forth in fourteen specifications under that charge.  The other charge is for "culpable inefficiency in the performance of duty," with four specifications, some of which, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 116 U. S. 182</a></p><p> at least, allege, though in different forms, acts set forth in the specifications under the first charge.</p>\n<p>If the court-martial has jurisdiction of the principal charge and of some or all of the specifications under it, the addition of the second charge, with its specifications, affords no ground for issuing a writ of prohibition.  The evidence taken before the court-martial is not produced or relied on by the petitioner.  The question presented by the record before us is whether the court-martial should be prohibited from trying him on the charges and specifications laid before it, and the case comes within the rule stated by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Washburn v. Phillips,</em> already cited:</p>\n<p>"Unless it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the court has no jurisdiction of any part of the subject matter of these charges, it is not a case for a prohibition."</p>\n<p>2 Met. 299.  There may indeed be cases in which two matters before the inferior court are so distinct that a writ of prohibition may go as to the one and not as to the other.  But when the leading charge is within its jurisdiction, and the other charge, though varying in form, is for the same or similar acts, like a second count in an indictment, and the same sentence may be awarded on the first charge as upon both, a writ of prohibition should not issue.  <em>Enraght v. Penzance,</em> 7 App.Cas. 240.</p>\n<p>The essential point to be determined therefore is whether the court-martial has jurisdiction of the first charge and whether it would have jurisdiction of the second, if that were the only one, is immaterial.</p>\n<p>In <em>Dynes v. Hoover,</em> above cited, this Court held that the jurisdiction of courts-martial, under the articles for the government of the navy established by Congress, was not limited to the crimes defined or specified in those articles, but extended to any offense which, by a fair deduction from the definition, Congress meant to subject to punishment, being</p>\n<p>"one of a minor degree, of kindred character, which has already been recognized to be such by the practice of courts-martial in the army and navy services of nations, and by those functionaries in different nations to whom has been confided a revising power over the sentences of courts-martial,"</p>\n<p>or which, though </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 116 U. S. 183</a></p><p> not included, in terms or by construction, within the definition, came within</p>\n<p>"a comprehensive enactment, such as the 32d article of the rules for the government of the navy, which means that courts-martial have jurisdiction of such crimes as are not specified, but which have been recognized to be crimes and offenses by the usages in the navy of all nations, and that they shall be punished according to the laws and customs of the sea."</p>\n<p>20 How.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/65/case.html#82">61 U. S. 82</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The 32d of the Articles for the Government of the Navy, established by the Act of April 23, 1800, c. 33, 2 Stat. 49, in force at the time of that decision, has been retained in the existing Article 22, before cited, substituting only at the beginning, the word "offenses" for "crimes," and, in describing the mode of punishment, the words "as a court-martial may direct," instead of "according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea."  As the article in its new form still applies only to offenses "not specified in the foregoing articles," the alteration was evidently intended to change only the rule of punishment, leaving within the jurisdiction of courts-martial cases not so specified, but recognized as military offenses by the usages of the naval service.  It does not, therefore, appear to us important to inquire whether, by the rules that govern military courts, the first charge should be considered as made under the concluding words of the first clause of Article 8, punishing "profane swearing, falsehood, drunkenness, gambling, theft, or any other scandalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals," or under Article 22, punishing "all offenses committed by persons belonging to the navy, which are not specified in the foregoing articles," for in either view, as we have already seen, it should, under the regulations of 1870, recognized and sanctioned by Congress, be charged as "scandalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals."</p>\n<p>Under every system of military law for the government of either land or naval forces, the jurisdiction of courts-martial extends to the trial and punishment of acts of military or naval officers which tend to bring disgrace and reproach upon the service of which they are members, whether those acts are done </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 116 U. S. 184</a></p><p> in the performance of military duties, or in a civil position, or in a social relation, or in private business.  Two cases often cited in books on military law show that acts having no relation to the public service, military or civil, except so far as they tend to bring disgrace and reproach upon the former -- such as making an unfounded claim for the price of a horse, or attempting to seduce a brother officer\'s wife during his illness -- may properly be prosecuted before a court-martial under an article of war punishing "scandalous and infamous conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman," for the sole ground on which the sentence was disapproved by the King in the one case, and by the Governor General of India in the other, was that the court-martial, while finding the facts proved, expressly negatived scandalous and infamous conduct, and thereby in effect acquitted the defendant of the charge.  2 McArthur on Courts Martial (4th ed.) 298; Hough\'s Precedents in Military Law 238; Samuel on Military Law 650-652; Simmons on Courts Martial (4th ed.) 418-420; De Hart on Courts Martial 375-377.</p>\n<p>In a third case, a lieutenant in the army was tried in England by a general court-martial for conduct on board ship while coming home from India as a private passenger on leave of absence from his regiment for two years.  The charge was that, being a passenger on board the ship <em>Caesar</em> on her voyage from Calcutta to England, he was accused of stealing property of one Ross, his servant, and that the officers and passengers of the ship, after inquiring into the accusation, expelled him from their table and society during the rest of the voyage; yet that he,</p>\n<p>"under the circumstances so degrading and disgraceful to him, neither then nor at any time afterwards took any measures as became an officer and a gentleman to vindicate his honor and reputation, all such conduct as aforesaid being to the prejudice of good order and military discipline."</p>\n<p>Before and at the trial, he objected that the charge against him did not, expressly or constructively, impute any military offense, or infraction of any of the articles of war, or any positive act of misconduct or neglect, to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, or state any fact which, if true, subjected him </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 116 U. S. 185</a></p><p> to be arraigned and tried as a military officer.  But the court-martial proceeded with the trial, found him "guilty of the whole of the charge produced against him, in breach of the articles of war," and sentenced him to be dismissed the service, and added</p>\n<p>"that it has considered the charge produced against the prisoner entirely in a military point of view, as affecting the good order and discipline of the army, and that it does not mean by its sentence to offer any opinion as to the original charge of theft, of which the prisoner was accused by the man Ross."</p>\n<p>The sentence was approved by the King and carried into execution, and for that reason the Court of King\'s Bench denied a writ of prohibition.  Lord Denman, in delivering judgment, said that the court did not think it necessary to consider whether the charge was so framed as to bring the party within the Articles of War, but that it agreed with Lord Loughborough\'s remark in <em>Grant v. Gould,</em> above cited that it would be extremely absurd to expect the same precision in a charge brought before a court-martial as was required to support a conviction by a justice of the peace.  <em>In re Poe,</em> 5 B. &amp; Ad. 681, 688; <em>S.C.,</em> 2 Nev. &amp; Man. 636, 644.</p>\n<p>Under the 61st of the Articles of War for the Government of the Army of the United States, which, omitting the words "scandalous or infamous," provides that "any officer who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be dismissed from the service," it is observed in the most recent treatise on military law, and supported by copious references to precedents,</p>\n<p>"While the act charged will more usually have been committed in a military capacity or have grown out of some military status or relation, it is by no means essential that this should have been its history.  It may equally well have originated in some private transaction of the party -- as a member of civil society or as a man of business which, while impeaching his personal honor, has involved such notoriety or publicity or led to such just complaint to superior military authority as to have seriously compromised his character and position as an officer of the army and brought scandal or reproach upon the service."</p>\n<p>1 Winthrop on Military Law 1023 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 116 U.

It is hardly necessary to add that by the Navy Regulations of 1870, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 260-265, the court-martial could only be dissolved by the Secretary of the Navy, and might at any time before he had dissolved it, be lawfully reconvened by him to reconsider its proceedings.  <em>Ex Parte Reed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/13/case.html">100 U.
