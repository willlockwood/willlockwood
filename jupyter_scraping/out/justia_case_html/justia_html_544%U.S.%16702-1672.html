He then received negative work evaluations and ultimately was removed as the girls\xe2\x80\x99 coach.  He brought this suit alleging that respondent school board (Board) had retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school\xe2\x80\x99s athletic program, and that such retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person \xe2\x80\xa6 shall, on the basis of sex, be \xe2\x80\xa6 subjected to discrimination under any education program \xe2\x80\xa6 receiving Federal financial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action does not include claims of retaliation, and the Eleventh Circuit agreed and affirmed.  The appeals court also concluded that, under <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does not create a private cause of action, and that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, petitioner is not within the class of persons the statute protects.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses claims of retaliation against an individual because he has complained about sex discrimination.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0When a funding recipient retaliates against a person <em>because</em> he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of Title IX.  This Court has held that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforce its prohibition on intentional sex discrimination, <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 690\xe2\x80\x93693, and that that right includes actions for monetary damages by private persons, <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Gwinnett County Public Schools</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/60/index.html">503 U. S. 60</a>, and encompasses intentional sex discrimination in the form of a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of a student by a teacher, <em>Gebser </em>v. <em>Lago Vista Independent School District</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/274/index.html">524 U. S. 274</a>, 290\xe2\x80\x93291, or by another student, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/629/index.html">526 U. S. 629</a>, 642.  In all of these cases, the Court relied on Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s broad language prohibiting a funding recipient from intentionally subjecting any person to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act.  It is a form of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d because the complainant is subjected to differential treatment.  Moreover, it is discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.  The Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Title IX does not prohibit retaliation because it is silent on the subject ignores the import of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated holdings construing \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d under Title IX broadly to include conduct, such as sexual harassment, which the statute does not expressly mention.  The fact that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits retaliation is of limited use with respect to Title IX.  Title VII is a vastly different statute, which details the conduct that constitutes prohibited discrimination.  Because Congress did not list <em>any</em> specific discriminatory practices in Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice says nothing about whether it intended that practice to be covered.  Moreover, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a>\xe2\x80\x94in which this Court interpreted 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition of racial discrimination to include retaliation against a white man for advocating the rights of blacks\xe2\x80\x94provides a realistic basis for presuming that Congress expected Title IX to be interpreted in conformity with <em>Sullivan</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Board cannot rely on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Sandoval, supra</em>, at 285, that, because Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself prohibits only intentional discrimination, private parties could not obtain redress for disparate-impact discrimination based on the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Title VI regulations forbidding federal funding recipients from adopting policies with such an impact.  Citing the Education Department\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX retaliation regulation, the Board contends that Jackson, like the <em>Sandoval</em> petitioners, seeks an impermissible extension of the statute when he argues that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses retaliation.  This argument, however, entirely misses the point.  The Court does not here rely on the Education Department regulation at all, because Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s text <em>itself</em> contains the necessary prohibition: Retaliation against a person who speaks out against sex discrimination is intentional \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Nor is the Court convinced by the Board\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, even if Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not entitled to invoke it because he is an \xe2\x80\x9cindirect victi[m]\xe2\x80\x9d of sex discrimination.  The statute is broadly worded; it does not require that the victim of the retaliation also be the victim of the discrimination that is the subject of the original complaint.  Where the retaliation occurs because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is satisfied.  The complainant is himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the original complaint.  Cf. <em>Sullivan, supra</em>, at 237.  Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of federal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also \xe2\x80\x9cto provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cannon, supra</em>, at 704.  This objective would be difficult to achieve if persons complaining about sex discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Nor can the Board rely on the principle that, because Title IX was enacted as an exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Spending Clause powers, a private damages action is available only if the federal funding recipient had adequate notice that it could be held liable for the conduct at issue, see, <em>e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17.  <em>Pennhurst</em> does not preclude such an action where, as here, the funding recipient engages in intentional acts that clearly violate Title IX.  See, <em>e.g., Davis, supra</em>, at 642.  Moreover, the Board should have been put on notice that it could be held liable for retaliation by the fact that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases since <em>Cannon</em> have consistently interpreted Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination; by Title IX itself, which expressly prohibits intentional conduct that violates clear statutory terms, <em>Davis, </em>526 U. S., at 642; by the regulations implementing Title IX, which clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years; and by the holdings of all of the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue that Title IX covers retaliation.  The Board could not have realistically supposed that, given this context, it remained free to retaliate against those who reported sex discrimination.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 644.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove that the Board retaliated against him <em>because</em> he complained of sex discrimination.  At the present stage, the issue is not whether he will ultimately prevail, but whether he is entitled to offer evidence to support his claims.

Jackson claimed that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92\xe2\x80\x93318, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681 <em>et seq</em>.  The District Court dismissed Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s complaint on the ground that Title IX does not prohibit retaliation, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  309 F. 3d 1333 (2002).  We consider here whether the private right of action implied by Title IX encompasses claims of retaliation.  We hold that it does where the funding recipient retaliates against an individual because he has complained about sex discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX claim was dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must assume the truth of the material facts as alleged in the complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Summit Health, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Pinhas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/322/index.html">500 U. S. 322</a>, 325 (1991).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the complaint, Jackson has been an employee of the Birmingham school district for over 10 years.  In 1993, the Board hired Jackson to serve as a physical education teacher and girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball coach.  Jackson was transferred to Ensley High School in August 1999.  At Ensley, he discovered that the girls\xe2\x80\x99 team was not receiving equal funding and equal access to athletic equipment and facilities.  The lack of adequate funding, equipment, and facilities made it difficult for Jackson to do his job as the team\xe2\x80\x99s coach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2000, Jackson began complaining to his supervisors about the unequal treatment of the girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team, but to no avail.  Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s complaints went unanswered, and the school failed to remedy the situation.  Instead, Jackson began to receive negative work evaluations and ultimately was removed as the girls\xe2\x80\x99 coach in May 2001.  Jackson is still employed by the Board as a teacher, but he no longer receives supplemental pay for coaching.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Board terminated Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s coaching duties, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  He alleged, among other things, that the Board violated Title IX by retaliating against him for protesting the discrimination against the girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team.  Amended Complaint 2\xe2\x80\x933, App. 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The Board moved to dismiss on the ground that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action does not include claims of retaliation.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  309 F.\xc2\xa03d 1333 (2002).  It assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that the Board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about Title IX violations.  It then held that Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s suit failed to state a claim because Title IX does not provide a private right of action for retaliation, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the text indicates any congressional concern with retaliation that might be visited on those who complain of Title IX violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1344.  Relying on our decision in <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a> (2001), the Court of Appeals also concluded that a Department of Education regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does not create a private cause of action for retaliation: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause Congress has not created a right through Title IX to redress harms resulting from retaliation, [the regulation] may not be read to create one either.\xe2\x80\x9d  309 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1346.  Finally, the court held that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, Jackson would not be entitled to relief because he is not within the class of persons protected by the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. __ (2004), to resolve a conflict in the Circuits over whether Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination.  Compare <em>Lowrey</em> v. <em>Texas A &amp; M Univ. System</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa03d 242, 252 (CA5 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]itle IX affords an implied cause of action for retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Preston</em> v. <em>Virginia ex rel. New River Community College</em>, 31 F.\xc2\xa03d 203, 206 (CA4 1994) (same); with the case below,  <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title IX prohibits sex discrimination by recipients of federal education funding.  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a).  More than 25 years ago, in <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 690\xe2\x80\x93693 (1979), we held that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforce its prohibition on intentional sex discrimination.  In subsequent cases, we have defined the contours of that right of action.  In <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Gwinnett County Public Schools</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/60/index.html">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992), we held that it authorizes private parties to seek monetary damages for intentional violations of Title IX.  We have also held that the private right of action encompasses intentional sex discrimination in the form of a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sexual harassment of a student, <em>Gebser</em> v. <em>Lago Vista Independent School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/274/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/274/index.html">524 U. S. 274</a>, 290\xe2\x80\x93291 (1998), or to sexual harassment of a student by another student, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/629/index.html"></a><a href="/us/526/629/index.html">526 U. S. 629</a>, 642 (1999).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all of these cases, we relied on the text of Title IX, which, subject to a list of narrow exceptions not at issue here, broadly prohibits a funding recipient from subjecting any person to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681.   Retaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action.  Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act.  It is a form of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment.  See generally <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>L. C., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/581/index.html">527 U. S. 581</a>, 614 (1999) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal definition of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cdifferential treatment\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/index.html">462 U. S. 669</a>, 682, n. 22 (1983) (discrimination means \xe2\x80\x9cless favorable\xe2\x80\x9d treatment).  Moreover, retaliation is discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.  We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person <em>because</em> he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of Title IX.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Title IX does not prohibit retaliation because the \xe2\x80\x9cstatute makes no mention of retaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d 309 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1344, ignores the import of our repeated holdings construing \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d under Title IX broadly.  Though the statute does not mention sexual harassment, we have held that sexual harassment is intentional discrimination encompassed by Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action.  <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U. S., at 74\xe2\x80\x9375; see also <em>id</em>., at 75 (noting that, under <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Vinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/57/index.html">477 U. S. 57</a>, 64 (1986), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s sex, that supervisor \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses \xe2\x80\xa6 a student\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s sexual harassment of a student also \xe2\x80\x9cviolate[s] Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis, supra,</em> at 643 (citing <em>Gebser</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 290\xe2\x80\x93291).  Likewise, a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of a student by another student also squarely constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 526 U. S., at 643; see also <em>id</em>., at 650 (\xe2\x80\x9cHaving previously determined that \xe2\x80\x98sexual harassment\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 . . . under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude that student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination actionable under the statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cDiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is a term that covers a wide range of intentional unequal treatment; by using such a broad term, Congress gave the statute a broad reach.  See <em>North Haven Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Bell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/512/index.html">456 U. S. 512</a>, 521 (1982) (Courts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must accord\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Title IX  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a sweep as broad as its language\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress certainly could have mentioned retaliation in Title IX expressly, as it did in \xc2\xa7704 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 86 Stat. 109, 42 U.

Title VII, however, is a vastly different statute from Title IX, see <em>Gebser</em>, 524 U.

Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action is implied, while Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s is express.  See <em>id.,</em> at 283\xe2\x80\x93284.  Title IX is a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination, followed by specific, narrow exceptions to that broad prohibition.  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681.  By contrast, Title VII spells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 (giving examples of unlawful employment practices), 2000e\xe2\x80\x933 (prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther unlawful employment practices,\xe2\x80\x9d including (a) \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of retaliation; and (b) the discriminatory practice of \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rinting or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because Congress did not list <em>any</em> specific discriminatory practices when it wrote Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does not tell us anything about whether it intended that practice to be covered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title IX was enacted in 1972, three years after our decision in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U.

Sullivan had rented a house to a black man and assigned him a membership share and use rights in a private park.  The corporation that owned the park would not approve the assignment to the black lessee.  Sullivan protested, and the corporation retaliated against him by expelling him and taking his shares.  Sullivan sued the corporation, and we upheld Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982 for \xe2\x80\x9c[retaliation] for the advocacy of [the black person\xe2\x80\x99s] cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  396 U. S., at 237.

S. 275</a> (2001), compels a holding that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not encompass retaliation.  <em>Sandoval</em> involved an interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d <em>et seq.,</em> which provides in \xc2\xa7601 that no person shall, \xe2\x80\x9con the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\xe2\x80\x9d covered by Title VI.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d.  Section 602 of Title VI authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisions in \xc2\xa7601 by enacting regulations.  Pursuant to that authority, the Department of Justice promulgated regulations forbidding funding recipients from adopting policies that had \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 CFR \xc2\xa742.104(b)(2) (1999).  The <em>Sandoval</em> petitioners brought suit to enjoin an English-only policy of the Alabama Department of Public Safety on grounds that it disparately impacted non-English speakers in violation of the regulations.  Though we assumed that the regulations themselves were valid, see 532 U. S., at 281, we rejected the contention that the private right of action to enforce intentional violations of Title VI encompassed suits to enforce the disparate-impact regulations.  We did so because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is clear . . . that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply \xc2\xa7601\xe2\x80\x94since they indeed forbid conduct that \xc2\xa7601 permits\xe2\x80\x94and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce \xc2\xa7601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 285.

Thus, <em>Sandoval</em> held that private parties may not invoke Title VI regulations to obtain redress for disparate-impact discrimination because Title VI itself prohibits only intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board cites a Department of Education regulation prohibiting retaliation \xe2\x80\x9cagainst any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by [Title IX],\xe2\x80\x9d 34 CFR \xc2\xa7100.7(e) (2004) (incorporated by reference by \xc2\xa7106.71), and contends that Jackson, like the petitioners in <em>Sandoval</em>, seeks an \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissible extension of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d when he argues that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses retaliation.  Brief for Respondent 45.  This argument, however, entirely misses the point.  We do not rely on regulations extending Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s protection beyond its statutory limits; indeed, we do not rely on the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s regulation at all, because the statute <em>itself</em> contains the necessary prohibition.  As we explain above, see <em>supra,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, the text of Title IX prohibits a funding recipient from retaliating against a person who speaks out against sex discrimination, because such retaliation is intentional \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  We reach this result based on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  In step with <em>Sandoval</em>, we hold that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses suits for retaliation, because retaliation falls within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we convinced by the Board\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, even if Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not entitled to invoke it because he is an \xe2\x80\x9cindirect victi[m]\xe2\x80\x9d of sex discrimination.  Brief for Respondent 33.  The statute is broadly worded; it does not require that the victim of the retaliation must also be the victim of the discrimination that is the subject of the original complaint.  If the statute provided instead that \xe2\x80\x9cno person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of <em>such individual\xe2\x80\x99s</em> sex,\xe2\x80\x9d then we would agree with the Board.  Cf. 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual \xe2\x80\xa6 because of <em>such individual\xe2\x80\x99s </em>race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  However, Title IX contains no such limitation.  Where the retaliation occurs because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is satisfied.  The complainant is himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the original complaint.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As we explain above, see <em>supra,</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x937, this is consistent with <em>Sullivan</em>, which formed an important part of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX.  <em>Sullivan</em> made clear that retaliation claims extend to those who oppose discrimination against others.  See 396 U. S., at 237 (holding that a person may bring suit under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982 if he can show that he was \xe2\x80\x9cpunished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of federal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also \xe2\x80\x9cto provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cannon</em>, 441 U. S., at 704.  We agree with the United States that this objective \xe2\x80\x9cwould be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about sex discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13.  If recipients were permitted to retaliate freely, individuals who witness discrimination would be loathe to report it, and all manner of Title IX violations might go unremedied as a result.  See <em>Sullivan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 237 (noting that without protection against retaliation, the underlying discrimination is perpetuated).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reporting incidents of discrimination is integral to Title IX enforcement and would be discouraged if retaliation against those who report went unpunished.  Indeed, if retaliation were not prohibited, Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement scheme would unravel.  Recall that Congress intended Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action to encompass claims of a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to sexual harassment.  See generally <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/629/index.html"></a><a href="/us/526/629/index.html">526 U. S. 629</a>.  Accordingly, if a principal sexually harasses a student, and a teacher complains to the school board but the school board is indifferent, the board would likely be liable for a Title IX violation.  See generally <em>Gebser</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/274/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/274/index.html">524 U. S. 274</a>.  But if Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not encompass retaliation claims, the teacher would have no recourse if he were subsequently fired for speaking out.  Without protection from retaliation, individuals who witness discrimination would likely not report it, indifference claims would be short-circuited, and the underlying discrimination would go unremedied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement scheme also depends on individual reporting because individuals and agencies may not bring suit under the statute unless the recipient has received \xe2\x80\x9cactual notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the discrimination.  <em>Id., </em>at 288, 289\xe2\x80\x93290 (holding that an appropriate official of the recipient must have actual knowledge of discrimination and respond with deliberate indifference before a private party may bring suit); 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71682 (providing that a federal agency may terminate funding only after it \xe2\x80\x9chas advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means\xe2\x80\x9d).  If recipients were able to avoid such notice by retaliating against all those who dare complain, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement scheme would be subverted.  We should not assume that Congress left such a gap in its scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, teachers and coaches such as Jackson are often in the best position to vindicate the rights of their students because they are better able to identify discrimination and bring it to the attention of administrators.  Indeed, sometimes adult employees are \xe2\x80\x9cthe only effective adversar[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination in schools.  See <em>Sullivan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 237 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] white owner is at times \xe2\x80\x98the only effective adversary\xe2\x80\x99 of the unlawful restrictive covenant\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U.

When Congress enacts legislation under its spending power, that legislation is \xe2\x80\x9cin the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U.

As we have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here can \xe2\x80\xa6 be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the contract] if a State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the legislation on its receipt of funds].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board insists that we should not interpret Title IX to prohibit retaliation because it was not on notice that it could be held liable for retaliating against those who complain of Title IX violations.  We disagree.  Funding recipients have been on notice that they could be subjected to private suits for intentional sex discrimination under Title IX since 1979, when we decided <em>Cannon</em>.  <em>Pennhurst</em> does not preclude private suits for intentional acts that clearly violate Title IX.  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 642.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in <em>Davis</em>, we held that <em>Pennhurst</em> did not pose an obstacle to private suits for damages in cases of a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate indifference to one student\xe2\x80\x99s sexual harassment of another, because the deliberate indifference constituted intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 650.  See also <em>Franklin</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 75 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress surely did not intend for federal monies to be expended to support the intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, we held in <em>Gebser</em> that a recipient of federal funding could be held liable for damages under Title IX for deliberate indifference to a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s harassment of a student.  524 U. S., at 287\xe2\x80\x93288.  In <em>Gebser</em>, as in <em>Davis</em>, we acknowledged that federal funding recipients must have notice that they will be held liable for damages.  See <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 642; <em>Gebser</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 287.  But we emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthis limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 642 (citing <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U. S.,<em> </em>at 74\xe2\x80\x9375).  See also <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he <em>[Pennhurst]</em> notice problem does not arise in a case such as this, in which intentional discrimination is alleged\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bennett</em> v. <em>Kentucky Dept. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/656/index.html">470 U. S. 656</a>, 665\xe2\x80\x93666 (1985) (holding that there was sufficient notice under <em>Pennhurst</em> where a statute made clear that some conditions were placed on the receipt of federal funds, and stating that Congress need not \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically identif[y] and proscrib[e]\xe2\x80\x9d each condition in the legislation).  Simply put, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Pennhurst</em> does not bar a private damages action under Title IX where the funding recipient engages in intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 526 U. S., at 642.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Board should have been put on notice by the fact that our cases since <em>Cannon</em>, such as <em>Gebser</em> and <em>Davis</em>, have consistently interpreted Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination.  Indeed, retaliation presents an even easier case than deliberate indifference.  It is easily attributable to the funding recipient, and it is always\xe2\x80\x94by definition\xe2\x80\x94intentional.  We therefore conclude that retaliation against individuals because they complain of sex discrimination is \xe2\x80\x9cintentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis,</em> 526 U. S., at 642, and that Title IX itself therefore supplied sufficient notice to the Board that it could not retaliate against Jackson after he complained of discrimination against the girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations implementing Title IX clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 643 (holding that Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory scheme \xe2\x80\x9chas long provided funding recipients with notice that they may be liable for their failure to respond to the discriminatory acts of certain nonagents\xe2\x80\x9d).  More importantly, the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue in this case all had already interpreted Title IX to cover retaliation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lowrey</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 252; <em>Preston</em>, 31 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 206.  The Board could not have realistically supposed that, given this context, it remained free to retaliate against those who reported sex discrimination.  Cf. <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 644 (stating that the common law of torts \xe2\x80\x9chas put schools on notice that they may be held responsible under state law for their failure to protect students from the tortious acts of third parties\xe2\x80\x9d).  A reasonable school board would realize that institutions covered by Title IX cannot cover up violations of that law by means of discriminatory retaliation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove that the Board retaliated against him <em>because</em> he complained of sex discrimination.  The amended complaint alleges that the Board retaliated against Jackson for complaining to his supervisor, Ms. Evelyn Baugh, about sex discrimination at Ensley High School.  At this stage of the proceedings, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scheuer</em> v.<em> Rhodes, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/232/index.html">416 U.

And, in cases in which a party asserts that a cause of action should be implied, we require that the statute itself evince a plain intent to provide such a cause of action.  Section 901 of Title IX meets none of these requirements.  I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Title IX provides education funding to States, subject to \xc2\xa7901\xe2\x80\x99s condition that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681(a).  Section 901 does not refer to retaliation.  Consequently, the statute prohibits such conduct only if it falls within \xc2\xa7901\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A claim of retaliation is not a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex.  In the context of \xc2\xa7901, the natural meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d is on the basis of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s sex, not the sex of some other person.  See <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen interpreting a statute we must give words their ordinary or natural meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  For example, suppose a sexist air traffic controller withheld landing permission for a plane because the pilot was a woman.  While the sex discrimination against the female pilot no doubt adversely impacted male passengers aboard that plane, one would never say that they were discriminated against \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d by the controller\xe2\x80\x99s action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 usage of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d confirms this commonsense conclusion.  Even within Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself, Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d as a shorthand for discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  Specifically, in ensuring that Title VII reached discrimination because of pregnancy, Congress provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he terms \xe2\x80\x98because of sex\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99 include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

S. 272</a>, 277 (1987) (describing how Congress amended Title VII to specify that sex discrimination included discrimination on the basis of pregnancy).  The reference to \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d in this provision must refer to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 sex,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that Congress used the phrases interchangeably.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  After all, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition against discriminatory employer practices does not use \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he terms \xe2\x80\x98because of sex\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  It uses only the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has also consistently used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d as a shorthand for on the basis of the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s sex.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burke,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/229/index.html">504 U. S. 229</a>, 239 (1992);<em> Meritor Savings Bank, FSB</em> v. <em>Vinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/57/index.html">477 U. S. 57</a>, 64 (1986).  Thus, for a disparate-treatment claim to be a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex, the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s sex must have \xe2\x80\x9cactually played a role in [the decisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html">507 U.

The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or [other protected trait]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the Birmingham Board of Educaton (Board) retaliated against him fails to allege sex discrimination in this sense.  Jackson does not claim that his own sex played any role, let alone a decisive or predominant one, in the decision to relieve him of his position.  Instead, he avers that he complained to his supervisor about sex discrimination against the girls\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team and that, sometime subsequent to his complaints, he lost his coaching position.  App. 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  At best, then, he alleges discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d founded on the attenuated connection between the supposed adverse treatment and the sex of others.  Because Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s claim for retaliation is not a claim that his sex played a role in his adverse treatment, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms do not encompass it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit therefore differs fundamentally from other examples of sex discrimination, like sexual harassment.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  A victim of sexual harassment suffers discrimination because of her own sex, not someone else\xe2\x80\x99s.  Cases in which this Court has held that \xc2\xa7901 reaches claims of vicarious liability for sexual harassment are therefore inapposite here.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/629/index.html">526 U. S. 629</a>, 641\xe2\x80\x93649 (1999); <em>Gebser</em> v. <em>Lago Vista Independent School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/274/index.html">524 U.

In fact, virtually every case in which this Court has addressed Title IX concerned a claimant who sought to recover for discrimination because of her own sex.  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 633\xe2\x80\x93635; <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</em> v. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/459/index.html">525 U.

S., at 680.  Again, Jackson makes no such claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim lacks the connection to actual sex discrimination that the statute requires.  Jackson claims that he suffered reprisal because he <em>complained about </em>sex discrimination, not that the sex discrimination underlying his complaint occurred.  This feature of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is not surprising, since a retaliation claimant need not prove that the complained-of sex discrimination happened.  Although this Court has never addressed the question, no Court of Appeals requires a complainant to show more than that he had a reasonable, good-faith belief that discrimination occurred to prevail on a retaliation claim.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Retaliation therefore cannot be said to be discrimination on the basis of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s sex, because a retaliation claim may succeed where no sex discrimination ever took place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority ignores these fundamental characteristics of retaliation claims.  Its sole justification for holding that Jackson has suffered sex discrimination is its statement that \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation is discrimination \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But the sex-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not based on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s sex, much less the complainer\xe2\x80\x99s sex.  For example, if a coach complains to school officials about the dismantling of the men\xe2\x80\x99s swimming team, which he honestly and reasonably, but incorrectly, believes is occurring because of the sex of the team, and he is fired, he may prevail.  Yet, he would not have been discriminated against on the basis of his sex, for his own sex played no role, and the men\xe2\x80\x99s swimming team over which he expressed concern also suffered no discrimination on the basis of sex.  In short, no discrimination on the basis of sex has occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At bottom, and petitioner as much as concedes, retaliation is a claim that aids in enforcing another separate and distinct right.  Brief for Petitioner 13 (noting the relationship retaliation bears to \xe2\x80\x9cprimary discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other contexts, this Court has recognized that protection from retaliation is separate from direct protection of the primary right and serves as a prophylactic measure to guard the primary right.  See <em>Crawford-El</em> v. <em>Britton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/574/index.html">523 U. S. 574</a>, 588, n. 10 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason why such retaliation offends the Constitution is that it threatens to inhibit the exercise of the protected right\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As we explained with regard to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation prohibition, \xe2\x80\x9ca primary purpose of antiretaliation provisions\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 346 (1997).  To describe retaliation as discrimination on the basis of sex is to conflate the enforcement mechanism with the right itself, something for which the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text provides no warrant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, that the text of Title IX does not mention retaliation is significant.  By contrast to Title IX, Congress enacted a separate provision in Title VII to address retaliation, in addition to its general prohibition on discrimination.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to include similar text in Title IX shows that it did not authorize private retaliation actions.  This difference cannot be dismissed, as the majority suggests, on the ground that Title VII is a more specific statute in which Congress proscribed particular practices, as opposed to the general prohibition here.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  The fact that Congress created those specific prohibitions in Title VII is evidence that it intended to preclude courts from implying similar specific prohibitions in Title IX.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even apart from Title VII, Congress expressly prohibited retaliation in other discrimination statutes.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712203(a) (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990); 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(d) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967).  If a prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d plainly encompasses retaliation, the explicit reference to it in these statutes, as well as in Title VII, would be superfluous\xe2\x80\x94a result we eschew in statutory interpretation.  The better explanation is that when Congress intends to include a prohibition against retaliation in a statute, it does so.  See<em> Central Bank of Denver, N. A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html">511 U. S. 164</a>, 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (1994).  Its failure to do so in \xc2\xa7901 is therefore telling.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is also inconsistent with two lines of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent: Our rule that Congress must speak with a clear voice when it imposes liability on the States through its spending power and our refusal to imply a cause of action when Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to create a right or a remedy is not evident.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority acknowledges, Congress enacted Title IX pursuant to its spending power.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (citing <em>Davis, </em>526 U.

This Court has repeatedly held that the obligations Congress imposes on States in spending power legislation must be clear.  Such legislation is \xe2\x80\x9cin the nature of a contract\xe2\x80\x9d and funding recipients\xe2\x80\x99 acceptance of the terms of that contract must be \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntar[y] and knowin[g].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U.

For their acceptance to be voluntary and knowing, funding recipients must \xe2\x80\x9chave notice of their potential liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 526 U. S., at 641.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n interpreting language in spending legislation, we \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98insis[t] that Congress speak with a clear voice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 640 (quoting <em>Pennhurst</em>, 451 U.

As I have explained, <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x937, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms do not authorize claims of retaliation.  The same analysis shows that, at the least, the statute does not clearly authorize retaliation claims.  The majority points out that the statute does not say: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of <em>such individual\xe2\x80\x99s</em> sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (emphasis in original).  But this reasoning puts the analysis backwards.  The question is not whether Congress clearly excluded retaliation claims under Title IX, but whether it clearly included them.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s statement at best points to ambiguity in the statute; yet ambiguity is resolved in favor of the States, which must be aware when they accept federal funds of the obligations they thereby agree to assume.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Board should have been put on notice by the fact that our cases since <em>Cannon</em>, such as <em>Gebser</em> and <em>Davis</em>, have consistently interpreted Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  <em>Gebser </em>and <em>Davis </em>did not hold or imply that Title IX prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cdiverse forms of intentional sex discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d; they held that schools could be held vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by students or teachers.  See <em>Gebser</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 277; <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 633.  There was no question that the sexual harassment in those cases was sex discrimination.  See <em>Meritor Savings,</em> 477 U. S., at 64 (\xe2\x80\x9cWithout question, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s sex, that supervisor \xe2\x80\x98discriminate[s]\xe2\x80\x99 on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d).  These cases hardly gave notice to the Board here that retaliation liability loomed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More important, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale untethers notice from the statute.  The Board, and other Title IX recipients, must now assume that if conduct can be linked to sex discrimination\xe2\x80\x94no matter how attenuated that link\xe2\x80\x94this Court will impose liability under Title IX.<em> </em>That there is a regulation proscribing retaliation in Title IX administrative enforcement proceedings is no answer, <em>ante</em>, at 13, for it says nothing about whether retaliation is discrimination on the basis of sex, much less whether there is a private cause of action for such conduct.  Rather than requiring clarity from Congress, the majority requires clairvoyance from funding recipients.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even apart from the clarity we consistently require of obligations imposed by spending power legislation, extending the cause of action implied in <em>Cannon</em> to Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s claim contradicts the standard we have set for implying causes of action to enforce federal statutes.  Whether a statute supplies a cause of action is a matter of statutory interpretation.  See <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Redington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/index.html">442 U. S. 560</a>, 568 (1979).  We must examine whether the statute creates a right.  That right \xe2\x80\x9cmust be phrased in terms of the person benefited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzaga</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted);<em> </em>see also<em> Virginia Bankshares, Inc.</em> v. <em>Sandberg,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/1083/index.html">501 U. S. 1083</a>, 1102, 1103 (1991).  And our inquiry is not merely whether the statute benefits some class of people, but whether that class includes the plaintiff in the case before us.  Our role, then, is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose\xe2\x80\x99 expressed by a statute,\xe2\x80\x9d but to examine the text of what Congress enacted into law.  <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 287 (2001)<em> </em>(quoting <em>J. I. Case Co.</em> v. <em>Borak,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/426/index.html">377 U.

If the statute evinces no intent to create a right for the plaintiff in the case before us, we should not imply a cause of action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has held that these principles apply equally when the Court has previously found that the statute in question provides an implied right of action and a party attempts to expand the class of persons or the conduct to which the recognized action applies.  <em>Virginia Bankshares,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 1102.  More specifically, this Court has rejected the creation of implied causes of action for ancillary claims like retaliation.  In <em>Central Bank</em>, we concluded that \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j provided no civil action against those who aid and abet individuals engaging in manipulative or deceptive practices, though the respondents urged that such a claim was necessary to fulfill the statute\xe2\x80\x99s protection against deceit in the securities marketplace.  511 U. S.,  at 177, 188.  We declined to do so even though this Court had implied a cause of action for \xc2\xa710(b).  See <em>Borak</em>,<em> supra</em>.  In our view, while the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language potentially reached the conduct of some aiders and abettors, the full scope of liability for aiding and abetting would have extended liability beyond the conduct prohibited by the statute.  <em>Central Bank</em>, 511 U. S., at 176.  We surveyed other statutes and found that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress knew how to impose aiding and abetting liability when it chose to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 176\xe2\x80\x93177<em>.</em>  Our view that the statute did not reach aiding and abetting was also confirmed by the fact that an \xe2\x80\x9celement critical for recovery\xe2\x80\x9d in actions against those engaging in fraudulent and manipulative acts was not required in proving that someone had aided and abetted such persons.  <em>Id.</em>, at 180.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same reasons militate equally against extending the implied cause of action under Title IX to retaliation claims.  As in <em>Central Bank</em>, imposing retaliation liability expands the statute beyond discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d to instances in which no discrimination on the basis of sex has occurred.  Again, \xc2\xa7901 protects individuals only from discrimination on the basis of their own sex.  <em>Supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  Thus, extending the implied cause of action under Title IX to claims of retaliation expands the class of people the statute protects beyond the specified beneficiaries.  As with the absence of aiding and abetting from the statute at issue in <em>Central Bank</em>, I find it instructive that \xc2\xa7901 does not expressly prohibit retaliation, while other discrimination statutes do so explicitly.  And like the aiding and abetting liability in <em>Central</em> <em>Bank</em>, prevailing on a claim of retaliation lacks elements necessary to prevailing on a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex, for no sex discrimination need have occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a> (1969), is wholly misplaced.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Rather than holding that a general prohibition against discrimination permitted a claim of retaliation, <em>Sullivan </em>held that a white lessor had standing to assert the right of a black lessee to be free from racial discrimination pursuant to Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71978, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982.  396 U. S., at 237 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here can be no question but that Sullivan has standing to maintain this action,\xe2\x80\x9d citing <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a> (1953), a standing case)).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To make out his third-party claim on behalf of the black lessee, the white lessor would necessarily be required to demonstrate that the defendant had discriminated against the black lessee on the basis of race.  Jackson, by contrast, need not show that the sex discrimination forming the basis of his complaints actually occurred.  Thus, by recognizing Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the majority creates an entirely new cause of action for a secondary rights holder, beyond the claim of the original rights holder, and well beyond <em>Sullivan</em>.  In any event, <em>Sullivan</em> involved \xc2\xa71982, a statute enacted pursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Thirteenth Amendment enforcement power, <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html">392 U. S. 409</a>, 437\xe2\x80\x93438 (1968), not its spending power.  <em>Sullivan</em> therefore says nothing about whether Title IX clearly conditions States\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of federal funds on retaliation liability.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court establishes a prophylactic enforcement mechanism designed to encourage whistleblowing about sex discrimination.  The language of Title IX does not support this holding.  The majority also offers nothing to demonstrate that its prophylactic rule is necessary to effectuate the statutory scheme.  Nothing prevents students\xe2\x80\x94or their parents\xe2\x80\x94from complaining about inequality in facilities or treatment.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U. S., at 63 (student brought suit); <em>Davis</em>, 526 U. S., at 633 (suit brought by minor\xe2\x80\x99s parent).  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, courts may expand liability as they, rather than Congress, see fit.  This is no idle worry.  The next step is to say that someone closely associated with the complainer, who claims he suffered retaliation for those complaints, likewise has a retaliation claim under Title IX.  See 2 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II, p.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be unlawful for a respondent to retaliate against an employee because his or her spouse, who is also an employee, filed an EEOC charge\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By crafting its own additional enforcement mechanism, the majority returns this Court to the days in which it created remedies out of whole cloth to effectuate its vision of congressional purpose.  In doing so, the majority substitutes its policy judgments for the bargains struck by Congress, as reflected in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The question before us is only whether Title IX prohibits retaliation, not whether prohibiting it is good policy.  <em>Central Bank</em>, 511 U. S., at 177.  For the reasons addressed above, I would hold that \xc2\xa7901 does not encompass private actions for retaliation.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Higgins</em> v. <em>New Balance Athletic Shoe</em>,<em> Inc.</em>, 194 F.\xc2\xa03d 252, 262 (CA1 1999); <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Daly</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 687, 701 (CA2 2001); <em>Aman</em> v. <em>Cort Furniture Rental Corp.</em>, 85 F.\xc2\xa03d 1074, 1085 (CA3 1996); <em>Byers</em> v. <em>Dallas Morning News, Inc.</em>, 209 F.\xc2\xa03d 419, 428 (CA5 2000); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>University of Cincinnati</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 561, 579\xe2\x80\x93580 (CA6 2000); <em>Talanda</em> v. <em>KFC Nat.

This \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d chain exposes the faulty premise in the position that retaliation is on the basis of sex.  The first and necessary step in this chain of causation is that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d occurred.  Yet, retaliation claims require proving no such thing.  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d link articulated by counsel between \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d and the adverse employment action does not exist.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See also <em>Great American Fed.
