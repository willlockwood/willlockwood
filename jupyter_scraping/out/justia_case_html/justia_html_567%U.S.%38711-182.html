The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its provisions from taking effect.  Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; \xc2\xa75(C) makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; \xc2\xa76 authorizes state and local officers to arrest without a warrant a person \xe2\x80\x9cthe officer has probable cause to believe .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xc2\xa72(B) requires officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to verify the person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status with the Federal Government.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had established a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0The Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad, undoubted power over immigration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04, and on its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations, see Toll v. Moreno, \n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  Federal governance is extensive and complex.  Among other things, federal law specifies categories of aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, \xc2\xa71324a; and specifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so, see \xc2\xa71227.  Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must decide whether to pursue removal at all.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing illegal aliens.  It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center, which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and local officials around the clock.

A statute may contain an express preemption provision, see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal law in at least two other circumstances.  First, States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.  See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 88\n.  Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation \xe2\x80\x9cso pervasive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it\xe2\x80\x9d or where a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n.  Second, state laws are preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they stand \xe2\x80\x9cas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hines v. Davidowitz, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52\n.

In Hines, a state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that Congress intended its \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d federal registration plan to be a \xe2\x80\x9csingle integrated and all-embracing system.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 74.  That scheme did not allow the States to \xe2\x80\x9ccurtail or complement\xe2\x80\x9d federal law or \xe2\x80\x9cenforce additional or auxiliary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  The federal registration framework remains comprehensive.  Because Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation is impermissible.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Section 5(C)\xe2\x80\x99s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the federal regulatory system.  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for \xe2\x80\x9ccombating the employment of illegal aliens,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137\n, makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify prospective employees\xe2\x80\x99 employment authorization status, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(B), (b).  It imposes criminal and civil penalties on employers, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71255(c)(2), (c)(8).   IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s express preemption provision, though silent about whether additional penalties may be imposed against employees, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles\xe2\x80\x9d or impose a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial burden\xe2\x80\x9d making it more difficult to establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.  Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 861\n\xe2\x80\x93872.  The correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized employees.  It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Congress chose.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless arrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, \xc2\xa76 too creates an obstacle to federal law.  As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States.  The federal scheme instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.  The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a warrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute.  If no federal warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited authority.  They may arrest an alien for being \xe2\x80\x9cin the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, but only where the alien \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71357(a)(2).  Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with even greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the Federal Government.  This is not the system Congress created.  Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform an immigration officer\xe2\x80\x99s functions.  This includes instances where the Attorney General has granted that authority in a formal agreement with a state or local government.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa71357(g)(1).  Although federal law permits state officers to \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral decision to detain authorized by \xc2\xa76.

Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system.  In fact, Congress has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(A), 1373(c).  The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.  Cf. Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.

This would raise constitutional concerns.  And it would disrupt the federal framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision.  But \xc2\xa72(B) could be read to avoid these concerns.  If the law only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been released, the provision would likely survive preemption\xe2\x80\x94at least absent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objectives.  Without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume \xc2\xa72(B) will be construed in a way that conflicts with federal law.  Cf. Fox v.

B. 1070 as preempted.  Four provisions of the law are at issue here.  Two create new state offenses.  Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x931509 (West Supp. 2011).

See \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x932928(C).  Two other provisions give specific arrest authority and inves- tigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and local law enforcement officers.

See Chy Lung v. Freeman, \n\n92 U.\xc2\xa0S. 275\n\xe2\x80\x93280 (1876); see also The Federalist No. 3, p.\xc2\xa039 (C. Rossiter ed. 2003) (J.

This Court has reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all international relationships .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country\xe2\x80\x99s own nationals when those nationals are in another country.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hines v.

Congress has specified catego- ries of aliens who may not be admitted to the United States.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182.  Unlawful entry and unlawful reentry into the country are federal offenses.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71325, 1326.  Once here, aliens are required to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status on their person.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71301\xe2\x80\x931306.  Failure to do so is a federal misdemeanor.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71304(e), 1306(a).  Federal law also authorizes States to deny noncitizens a range of public benefits, \xc2\xa71622; and it imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, \xc2\xa71324a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress has specified which aliens may be removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so.  Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.  See \xc2\xa71227.  Re- moval is a civil, not criminal, matter.  A principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.  See Brief for Former Commissioners of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service as Amici Curiae 8\xe2\x80\x9313 (hereinafter Brief for Former INS Commissioners).  Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.  If removal proceedings commence, aliens may seek asylum and other discretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without formal removal.  See \xc2\xa71229a(c)(4); see also, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71158 (asylum), 1229b (cancellation of removal), 1229c (voluntary departure).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDiscretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns.  Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime.  The equities of an individual case may turn on many factors, including whether the alien has children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished military service.  Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s international relations.  Returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for admission.  The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be harmed upon return.  The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are con- sistent with this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy with respect to these and other realities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgencies in the Department of Homeland Security play a major role in enforcing the country\xe2\x80\x99s immigration laws.  United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is re- sponsible for determining the admissibility of aliens and securing the country\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  See Dept. of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Immigration Enforcement Actions: 2010, p.\xc2\xa01 (2011).  In 2010, CBP\xe2\x80\x99s Border Patrol apprehended almost half a million people.  Id., at 3.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a second agency, \xe2\x80\x9cconducts criminal investigations involving the enforcement of immigration-related statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 2.  ICE also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center.  LESC, as the Center is known, provides immigra- tion status information to federal, state, and local officials around the clock.  See App. 91.  ICE officers are respon- sible \xe2\x80\x9cfor the identification, apprehension, and removal of illegal aliens from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Immigration Enforcement Actions, supra, at 2.  Hundreds of thousands of aliens are removed by the Federal Government every year.  See id., at 4 (reporting there were 387,242 removals, and 476,405 returns without a removal order, in 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe pervasiveness of federal regulation does not di- minish the importance of immigration policy to the States.  Arizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful immigration.  Hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens are apprehended in Arizona each year.  Dept. of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, 2010 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 93 (2011) (Table 35).  Unauthorized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one es- timate, almost six percent of the population.  See Passel &amp; Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, U.\xc2\xa0S. Unauthorized Im- migration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade 3 (2010).  And in the State\xe2\x80\x99s most populous county, these aliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate share of serious crime.  See, e.g., Camarota &amp; Vaughan, Center for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Crime: Assessing a Conflicted Situation 16 (2009) (Table 3) (estimating that unauthorized aliens comprise 8.9% of the population and are responsible for 21.8% of the felonies in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStatistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.  Accounts in the record suggest there is an \xe2\x80\x9cepidemic of crime, safety risks, serious property damage, and environmental problems\xe2\x80\x9d associated with the influx of illegal migration across private land near the Mexican border.  Brief for Petitioners 6.  Phoenix is a major city of the United States, yet signs along an interstate highway 30 miles to the south warn the public to stay away.

The issue is whether, under pre- emption principles, federal law permits Arizona to implement the state-law provisions in dispute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts the principle that both the National and State Governments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to respect.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, \n457 (1991)\n; U.\xc2\xa0S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 779, \n838 (1995)\n (Kennedy, J., concurring).  From the existence of two sovereigns follows the possibility that laws can be in conflict or at cross-purposes.  The Supremacy Clause provides a clear rule that federal law \xe2\x80\x9cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02.  Under this principle, Congress has the power to preempt state law.  See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 363, \n372 (2000)\n; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210\xe2\x80\x93211 (1824).  There is no doubt that Congress may withdraw specified powers from the States by enacting a statute containing an express preemption provision.  See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tState law must also give way to federal law in at least two other circumstances.  First, the States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.  See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 88, \n115 (1992)\n.  The intent to displace state law altogether can be inferred from a framework of regulation \xe2\x80\x9cso pervasive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it\xe2\x80\x9d or where there is a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n\n331 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n230 (1947)\n; see English v. General Elec.

Crosby, supra, at 372.  This includes cases where \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132\n\xe2\x80\x93143 (1963), and those instances where the challenged state law \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Hines, 312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 67; see also Crosby, supra, at 373 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects\xe2\x80\x9d).  In preemption analysis, courts should assume that \xe2\x80\x9cthe historic police powers of the States\xe2\x80\x9d are not superseded \xe2\x80\x9cunless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rice, supra, at 230; see Wyeth v.

B. 1070 creates a new state misde- meanor.  It forbids the \xe2\x80\x9cwillful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in violation of 8 United States Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x931509(A) (West Supp. 2011).  In effect, \xc2\xa73 adds a state-law penalty for conduct proscribed by federal law.  The United States contends that this state enforcement mechanism intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in which Congress has left no room for States to regulate.  See Brief for United States 27, 31.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court discussed federal alien-registration requirements in Hines v. Davidowitz, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52\n.  In 1940, as international conflict spread, Congress added to federal immigration law a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete system for alien registration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 70.  The new federal law struck a careful balance.  It punished an alien\xe2\x80\x99s willful failure to register but did not require aliens to carry identification cards.  There were also limits on the sharing of registration records and fingerprints.  The Court found that Congress intended the federal plan for registration to be a \xe2\x80\x9csingle integrated and all-embracing system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 74.  Because this \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the registration of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d touched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to \xe2\x80\x9ccurtail or complement\xe2\x80\x9d federal law or to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce additional or auxiliary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  As a con- sequence, the Court ruled that Pennsylvania could not enforce its own alien-registration program.  See id., at 59, 74.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe present regime of federal regulation is not identi- cal to the statutory framework considered in Hines, but it remains comprehensive.  Federal law now includes a requirement that aliens carry proof of registration.  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304(e).  Other aspects, however, have stayed the same.  Aliens who remain in the country for more than 30 days must apply for registration and be fingerprinted.  Compare \xc2\xa71302(a) with id., \xc2\xa7452(a) (1940 ed.).  Detailed information is required, and any change of address has to be reported to the Federal Government.  Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71304(a), 1305(a) (2006 ed.), with id., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7455(a), 456 (1940 ed.).  The statute continues to provide penalties for the willful failure to register.  Compare \xc2\xa71306(a) (2006 ed.), with id., \xc2\xa7457 (1940 ed.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclusion here, as it did in Hines, that the Federal Government has occupied the field of alien registration.  See American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396\n, n.\xc2\xa011 (2003) (characterizing Hines as a field preemption case); Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n\n350 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497, \n504 (1956)\n (same); see also Dinh, Reassessing the Law of Preemption, 88 Geo. L.\xc2\xa0J. 2085, 2098\xe2\x80\x932099, 2107 (2000) (same).  The federal statu- tory directives provide a full set of standards governing alien registration, including the punishment for noncompliance.  It was designed as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98harmonious whole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Hines, supra, at 72.  Where Congress occupies an entire field, as it has in the field of alien registration, even complementary state regulation is impermissible.  Field pre- emption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any state regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to fed- eral standards.  See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n249 (1984)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederal law makes a single sovereign responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep track of aliens within the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  If \xc2\xa73 of the Arizona statute were valid, every State could give itself independent authority to prosecute federal registration violations, \xe2\x80\x9cdiminish[ing] the [Federal Government]\xe2\x80\x99s control over enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdetract[ing] from the \xe2\x80\x98integrated scheme of regulation\xe2\x80\x99 created by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 282\n\xe2\x80\x93289 (1986).  Even if a State may make violation of federal law a crime in some instances, it cannot do so in a field (like the field of alien registration) that has been occupied by federal law.  See California v. Zook, \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725\n\xe2\x80\x93731, 733 (1949); see also In re Loney, \n\n134 U.\xc2\xa0S. 372\n\xe2\x80\x93376 (1890) (States may not impose their own punishment for perjury in federal courts).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArizona contends that \xc2\xa73 can survive preemption because the provision has the same aim as federal law and adopts its substantive standards.  This argument not only ignores the basic premise of field preemption\xe2\x80\x94that States may not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Government has reserved for itself\xe2\x80\x94but also is unpersuasive on its own terms.  Permitting the State to impose its own penalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with the careful framework Congress adopted.  Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Legal Comm., \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 341\n\xe2\x80\x93348 (2001) (States may not impose their own punishment for fraud on the Food and Drug Administration); Wisconsin Dept., supra, at 288 (States may not impose their own punishment for repeat violations of the National Labor Relations Act).  Were \xc2\xa73 to come into force, the State would have the power to bring criminal charges against individuals for violating a federal law even in circumstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is a further intrusion upon the federal scheme.  Even where federal authorities believe prosecution is ap- propriate, there is an inconsistency between \xc2\xa73 and fed- eral law with respect to penalties.  Under federal law, the failure to carry registration papers is a misdemeanor that may be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or a term of probation.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304(e) (2006 ed.); \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73561.  State law, by contrast, rules out probation as a possible sentence (and also eliminates the possibility of a pardon).  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x931509(D) (West Supp. 2011).  This state framework of sanctions creates a conflict with the plan Congress put in place.  See Wisconsin Dept., supra, at 286 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]onflict is imminent whenever two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same activity\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese specific conflicts between state and federal law simply underscore the reason for field preemption.  As it did in Hines, the Court now concludes that, with respect to the subject of alien registration, Congress intended to preclude States from \xe2\x80\x9ccomplement[ing] the federal law, or enforc[ing] additional or auxiliary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x932928(C) (West Supp. 2011).  Violations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarceration for up to six months.

The United States contends that the provision upsets the bal- ance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle to the federal plan of regulation and control.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen there was no comprehensive federal program regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens, this Court found that a State had authority to pass its own laws on the subject.  In 1971, for example, California passed a law imposing civil penalties on the employment of aliens who were \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  1971 Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, \xc2\xa71(a).  The law was upheld against a preemption challenge in De Canas v. Bica, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351 (1976)\n.  De Canas recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cStates possess broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 356.  At that point, however, the Federal Government had expressed no more than \xe2\x80\x9ca peripheral concern with [the] employment of illegal entrants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 360; see Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCurrent federal law is substantially different from the regime that prevailed when De Canas was decided.  Congress enacted IRCA as a comprehensive framework for \xe2\x80\x9ccombating the employment of illegal aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137, \n147 (2002)\n.  The law makes it illegal for employers to know- ingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  It also requires every employer to verify the employment authorization status of prospective employees.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(a) (1)(B), (b); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.2(b) (2012).  These requirements are enforced through criminal penalties and an escalat- ing series of civil penalties tied to the number of times an employer has violated the provisions.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(e)(4), (f); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7274a.10.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis comprehensive framework does not impose federal criminal sanctions on the employee side (i.e., penalties on aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work).  Under federal law some civil penalties are imposed instead.  With certain exceptions, aliens who accept unlawful employment are not eligible to have their status adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71255(c)(2), (c)(8).  Aliens also may be removed from the country for having engaged in unauthorized work.  See \xc2\xa71227(a)(1)(C)(i); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7214.1(e).  In addition to specifying these civil consequences, federal law makes it a crime for unauthorized workers to obtain employment through fraudulent means.  See \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71546(b).  Congress has made clear, however, that any information employees submit to indicate their work status \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be used\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes other than prosecution under specified federal criminal statutes for fraud, perjury, and related conduct.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71324a(b)(5), (d)(2)(F)\xe2\x80\x93(G).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact that Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose crim- inal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment.  A commission established by Congress to study immigration policy and to make recommen- dations concluded these penalties would be \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary and unworkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S.

See Brief for Service Employees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  But Congress rejected them.  See, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. 14184 (1973) (statement of Rep. Dennis).  In the end, IRCA\xe2\x80\x99s framework reflects a considered judgment that making criminals out of aliens engaged in unauthorized work\xe2\x80\x94aliens who already face the possibility of employer exploitation because of their removable status\xe2\x80\x94would be inconsistent with federal policy and ob- jectives.  See, e.g., Hearings before the Subcommittee No.\xc2\xa01 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., pt.\xc2\xa03, pp.\xc2\xa0919\xe2\x80\x93920 (1971) (statement of Rep.

Under \xc2\xa75(C) of S. B. 1070, Arizona law would interfere with the careful balance struck by Congress with respect to unauthorized employment of aliens.  Although \xc2\xa75(C) attempts to achieve one of the same goals as federal law\xe2\x80\x94the deterrence of unlawful employment\xe2\x80\x94it involves a conflict in the method of enforcement.  The Court has recognized that a \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onflict in technique can be fully as disruptive to the system Congress enacted as conflict in overt policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, \n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 274, \n287 (1971)\n.  The correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized employment.  It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Congress chose.  See Puerto Rico Dept. of Con- sumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495, \n503 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a comprehensive federal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regulated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn\xe2\x80\x94not from federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with action\xe2\x80\x9d).

[the person] has committed any public offense that makes [him] removable from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x933883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011).  The United States argues that arrests authorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the removal system Congress created.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.  See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1032, \n1038 (1984)\n.  If the police stop someone based on nothing more than possible removability, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent.  When an alien is suspected of being removable, a federal official issues an administrative document called a Notice to Ap- pear.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229(a); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7239.1(a) (2012).   The form does not authorize an arrest.  Instead, it gives the alien information about the proceedings, including the time and date of the removal hearing.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229(a)(1).  If an alien fails to appear, an in absentia order may direct removal.  \xc2\xa71229a(5)(A).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal statutory structure instructs when it is ap- propriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.  For example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion to issue a warrant for an alien\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and detention \xe2\x80\x9cpending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71226(a); see Memorandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field Office Directors et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter 2011 ICE Memorandum) (describing factors informing this and re- lated decisions).  And if an alien is ordered removed after a hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant.   See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7241.2(a)(1).  In both instances, the warrants are executed by federal officers who have received training in the enforcement of immigration law.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7241.2(b), 287.5(e)(3).  If no federal warrant has been issued, those officers have more limited authority.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(a).  They may arrest an alien for being \xe2\x80\x9cin the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or regula- tion,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, but only where the alien \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71357(a)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 6 attempts to provide state officers even greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability than Congress has given to trained federal immi- gration officers.  Under state law, officers who believe an alien is removable by reason of some \xe2\x80\x9cpublic offense\xe2\x80\x9d would have the power to conduct an arrest on that basis regardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or the alien is likely to escape.  This state authority could be exercised without any input from the Federal Government about whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case.  This would allow the State to achieve its own immigra- tion policy.  The result could be unnecessary harassment of some aliens (for instance, a veteran, college student, or someone assisting with a criminal investigation) whom federal officials determine should not be removed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not the system Congress created.  Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.  A principal example is when the Attorney General has granted that authority to specific officers in a formal agreement with a state or local government.  See \xc2\xa71357(g)(1); see also \xc2\xa71103(a)(10) (authority may be extended in the event of an \xe2\x80\x9cimminent mass influx of aliens off the coast of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71252c (authority to arrest in specific circumstance after consultation with the Federal Government); \xc2\xa71324(c) (authority to arrest for bringing in and harboring certain aliens).  Officers covered by these agreements are subject to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s direction and super- vision.  \xc2\xa71357(g)(3).  There are significant complexities involved in enforcing federal immigration law, including the determination whether a person is removable.  See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2010) (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x937).  As a result, the agreements reached with the Attorney General must contain written certification that officers have received adequate training to carry out the duties of an immigration officer.  See \xc2\xa71357(g)(2); cf. 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7287.5(c) (ar- rest power contingent on training), 287.1(g) (defining the training).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy authorizing state officers to decide whether an alien should be detained for being removable, \xc2\xa76 violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government.  See, e.g., Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., \n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471\n\xe2\x80\x93484 (1999); see also Brief for Former INS Commissioners 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  A decision on removability requires a determination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign national to continue living in the United States.  Decisions of this nature touch on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, \n348 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cRemoval decisions, including the selection of a removed alien\xe2\x80\x99s destination, may implicate [the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s] relations with foreign powers and require consideration of changing political and economic circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Galvan v.

There may be some ambiguity as to what constitutes cooperation under the federal law; but no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien for being removable absent any request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.  The Department of Homeland Security gives examples of what would constitute cooperation under federal law.  These include situations where States participate in a joint task force with federal officers, provide operational support in executing a warrant, or allow federal immigration officials to gain access to detainees held in state facilities.  See Dept. of Homeland Security, Guidance on State and Local Governments\xe2\x80\x99 Assistance in Immigration Enforcement and Related Matters 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (2011), online at http:// www.dhs.gov/files/resources/immigration.shtm (all Internet materials as visited June 21, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  State officials can also assist the Federal Government by responding to requests for information about when an alien will be released from their custody.  See \xc2\xa71357(d).  But the unilateral state action to detain authorized by \xc2\xa76 goes far beyond these measures, defeating any need for real cooperation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress has put in place a system in which state officers may not make warrantless arrests of aliens based on possible removability except in specific, limited circumstances.

Congress has made clear that no formal agreement or special training needs to be in place for state officers to \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicate with the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration status of any individual, including reporting knowledge that a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(A).  And Congress has obligated ICE to respond to any request made by state officials for verification of a person\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship or im- migration status.  See \xc2\xa71373(c); see also \xc2\xa71226(d)(1)(A) (requiring a system for determining whether individuals arrested for aggravated felonies are aliens).  ICE\xe2\x80\x99s Law Enforcement Support Center operates \xe2\x80\x9c24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year\xe2\x80\x9d and provides, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration status, identity information and real-time assistance to local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  ICE, Fact Sheet: Law Enforcement Support Center (May 29, 2012), online at http:// www.ice.gov/news/library/factsheets/lesc.htm.

It is true that \xc2\xa72(B) does not allow state officers to consider federal enforcement priorities in deciding whether to contact ICE about someone they have detained.  See Brief for United States 47\xe2\x80\x9350.  In other words, the officers must make an inquiry even in cases where it seems unlikely that the Attorney General would have the alien removed.  This might be the case, for example, when an alien is an elderly veteran with significant and longstanding ties to the community.  See 2011 ICE Memorandum 4\xe2\x80\x935 (mentioning these factors as relevant).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate to communicate with ICE in these situations, however.  Indeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(g) (10)(A).  A federal statute regulating the public benefits provided to qualified aliens in fact instructs that \xe2\x80\x9cno State or local government entity may be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from [ICE] information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71644.  The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.  Cf. Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324) (rejecting argument that federal law preempted Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that employers determine whether employees were eligible to work through the federal E-Verify system where the Federal Government had encouraged its use).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSome who support the challenge to \xc2\xa72(B) argue that, in practice, state officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their immigration status.  See, e.g., Brief for Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 37, n.\xc2\xa049.  Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323, \n333 (2009)\n; Illinois v. Caballes, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405, \n407 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it would disrupt the federal framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision.  Cf. Part IV\xe2\x80\x93C, supra (concluding that Ari- zona may not authorize warrantless arrests on the basis of removability).  The program put in place by Congress does not allow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement mechanism.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut \xc2\xa72(B) could be read to avoid these concerns.  To take one example, a person might be stopped for jaywalking in Tucson and be unable to produce identification.  The first sentence of \xc2\xa72(B) instructs officers to make a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d attempt to verify his immigration status with ICE if there is reasonable suspicion that his presence in the United States is unlawful.  The state courts may conclude that, unless the person continues to be suspected of some crime for which he may be detained by state officers, it would not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration inquiry.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 12, n.\xc2\xa04 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Section 2(B)] does not require the verification be completed during the stop or detention if that is not reasonable or practicable\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. Muehler v. Mena, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93, \n101 (2005)\n (finding no \n \nFourth Amendment violation where questioning about immigration status did not prolong a stop).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo take another example, a person might be held pending release on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.  As this goes beyond a mere stop, the arrestee (unlike the jaywalker) would appear to be subject to the categorical requirement in the second sentence of \xc2\xa72(B) that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status determined before [he] is released.\xe2\x80\x9d  State courts may read this as an instruction to initiate a status check every time someone is arrested, or in some subset of those cases, rather than as a command to hold the person until the check is complete no matter the circumstances.  Even if the law is read as an instruction to complete a check while the person is in custody, moreover, it is not clear at this stage and on this record that the verification process would result in prolonged detention.  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHowever the law is interpreted, if \xc2\xa72(B) only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been released, the provision likely would survive pre- emption\xe2\x80\x94at least absent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objectives.  There is no need in this case to address whether reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigration crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a detention, or whether this too would be preempted by federal law.  See, e.g., United States v. Di Re, \n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581, \n589 (1948)\n (authority of state officers to make arrests for federal crimes is, absent federal statutory instruction, a matter of state law); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F.\xc2\xa02d 468, 475\xe2\x80\x93476 (CA9 1983) (concluding that Arizona officers have authority to enforce the criminal provisions of federal immigration law), overruled on other grounds in Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.\xc2\xa03d 1037 (CA9 1999).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe nature and timing of this case counsel caution in evaluating the validity of \xc2\xa72(B).  The Federal Government has brought suit against a sovereign State to challenge the provision even before the law has gone into effect.  There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced.  At this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume \xc2\xa72(B) will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.  Cf. Fox v. Washington, \n\n236 U. S. 273, \n277 (1915)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as statutes fairly may be construed in such a way as to avoid doubtful constitutional questions they should be so construed; and it is to be presumed that state laws will be construed in that way by the state courts\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  As a result, the United States cannot prevail in its current challenge.  See Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, \n\n362 U. S. 440, \n446 (1960)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cTo hold otherwise would be to ignore the teaching of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions which enjoin seeking out conflicts between state and federal regulation where none clearly exists\xe2\x80\x9d).  This opinion does not foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tImmigration policy shapes the destiny of the Nation.

Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 132\xe2\x80\x93133 (1837).  And the Constitution did not strip the States of that authority.  To the contrary, two of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s provisions were designed to enable the States to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cthe intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from James Madison to Edmund Randolph (Aug. 27, 1782), in 1 The Writings of James Madison 226 (1900); accord, The Federalist No. 42, pp. 269\xe2\x80\x93271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  The Articles of Confederation had provided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe free inhabitants of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Articles of Confederation, Art. IV.  This meant that an unwelcome alien could obtain all the rights of a citizen of one State simply by first becoming an inhabitant of another.  To remedy this, the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Privileges and Immunities Clause provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. IV, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01 (emphasis added).  But if one State had particularly lax citizenship standards, it might still serve as a gateway for the entry of \xe2\x80\x9cobnoxious aliens\xe2\x80\x9d into other States.  This problem was solved \xe2\x80\x9cby authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 42, supra, at 271; see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04.  In other words, the naturalization power was given to Congress not to abrogate States\xe2\x80\x99 power to exclude those they did not want, but to vindicate it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo other provisions of the Constitution are an acknowledgment of the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign interest in protecting their borders.  Article I provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it\xe2\x80\x99s inspection Laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa02 (emphasis added).  This assumed what everyone assumed: that the States could exclude from their territory dangerous or unwholesome goods.  A later portion of the same section provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State shall, without the Consent of Congress, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa03 (emphasis added).  This limits the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty (in a way not relevant here) but leaves intact their inherent power to protect their territory.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNotwithstanding \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he myth of an era of unrestricted immigration\xe2\x80\x9d in the first 100 years of the Republic, the States enacted numerous laws restricting the immigra- tion of certain classes of aliens, including convicted criminals, indigents, persons with contagious diseases, and (in Southern States) freed blacks.

Notably, moreover, the Federalist proponents of the Act defended it primarily on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he removal of aliens is the usual preliminary of hostility\xe2\x80\x9d and could therefore be justified in exercise of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s war powers.

Since the founding era (though not immediately), doubt about the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s power has disappeared.  Indeed, primary responsibility for immigration policy has shifted from the States to the Federal Government.  Congress exercised its power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04, very early on, see An Act to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, \n\n1Stat.\n103.  But with the fleeting exception of the Alien Act, Congress did not enact any legislation regulating immigration for the better part of a century.  In 1862, Congress passed \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to prohibit the \xe2\x80\x98Coolie Trade\xe2\x80\x99 by American Citizens in American Vessels,\xe2\x80\x9d which prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cprocuring [Chinese nationals] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be disposed of, or sold, or transferred, for any term of years or for any time what- ever, as servants or apprentices, or to be held to service or labor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n12Stat.\n340.  Then, in 1875, Congress amended that act to bar admission to Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian immigrants who had \xe2\x80\x9centered into a contract or agreement for a term of service within the United States, for lewd and immoral purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  An act supplementary to the acts in relation to immigration, ch. 141, \n\n18Stat.\n477.  And in 1882, Congress enacted the first general immi- gration statute.  See An act to regulate Immigration, \n\n22Stat.\n214.  Of course, it hardly bears mention that Federal immigration law is now extensive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI accept that as a valid exercise of federal power\xe2\x80\x94not because of the Naturalization Clause (it has no necessary connection to citizenship) but because it is an inherent attribute of sovereignty no less for the United States than for the States.  As this Court has said, it is an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98accepted maxim of international law, that every sovereign nation has the power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to self-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Fong Yue Ting v.

That is why there was no need to set forth control of immigration as one of the enumer- ated powers of Congress, although an acknowledgment of that power (as well as of the States\xe2\x80\x99 similar power, subject to federal abridgment) was contained in Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, which provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the predominance of federal immigration restrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional role in regulating immigration\xe2\x80\x94and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so.  I accept as a given that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution when (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or (2) it conflicts with federal regulation\xe2\x80\x94when, for example, it admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or excludes those whom federal regulation would admit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPossibility (1) need not be considered here: there is no federal law prohibiting the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power to ex- clude (assuming federal authority to enact such a law).  The mere existence of federal action in the immigration area\xe2\x80\x94and the so-called field preemption arising from that action, upon which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion so heavily relies, ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x94cannot be regarded as such a prohibition.  We are not talking here about a federal law prohibiting the States from regulating bubble-gum advertising, or even the construction of nuclear plants.  We are talking about a federal law going to the core of state sovereignty: the power to exclude.  Like elimination of the States\xe2\x80\x99 other inherent sovereign power, immunity from suit, elimina- tion of the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power to exclude requires that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unequivocally expres[s] its intent to abrogate,\xe2\x80\x9d Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 44, \n55 (1996)\n (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Implicit \xe2\x80\x9cfield preemption\xe2\x80\x9d will not do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor can federal power over illegal immigration be deemed exclusive because of what the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion solicitously calls \xe2\x80\x9cforeign countries[\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99] concern[s] about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3.  The Constitution gives all those on our shores the protections of the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x94but just as those rights are not expanded for foreign nationals because of their countries\xe2\x80\x99 views (some countries, for example, have recently discovered the death penalty to be barbaric), neither are the fundamental sovereign powers of the States abridged to accommodate foreign countries\xe2\x80\x99 views.  Even in its international relations, the Federal Government must live with the inconvenient fact that it is a Union of independent States, who have their own sovereign powers.  This is not the first time it has found that a nuisance and a bother in the conduct of foreign policy.  Four years ago, for example, the Government importuned us to interfere with thoroughly constitutional state judicial procedures in the criminal trial of foreign nationals because the international community, and even an opinion of the International Court of Justice, disapproved them.  See Medell\xc3\xadn v. Texas, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491 (2008)\n.  We rejected that request, as we should reject the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of foreign-affairs considerations here.  Though it may upset foreign powers\xe2\x80\x94and even when the Federal Government desperately wants to avoid upsetting foreign powers\xe2\x80\x94the States have the right to protect their borders against foreign nationals, just as they have the right to execute foreign nationals for murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat this case comes down to, then, is whether the Arizona law conflicts with federal immigration law\xe2\x80\x94whether it excludes those whom federal law would admit, or admits those whom federal law would exclude.  It does not purport to do so.  It applies only to aliens who neither possess a privilege to be present under federal law nor have been removed pursuant to the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s inherent authority.

That concession, in my view, ob- viates the need for further inquiry.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s conflict-pre-emption claim calls on us \xe2\x80\x9cto determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hines v. Davidowitz, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52, \n67 (1941)\n (emphasis added).  It is impossible to make such a finding without a factual record concerning the manner in which Arizona is implementing these provisions\xe2\x80\x94something the Government\xe2\x80\x99s pre-enforcement challenge has pretermitted.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that [a law] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insuf- ficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an \xe2\x80\x98overbreadth\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine outside the limited context of the \n \nFirst Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Sal- erno, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 739, \n745 (1987)\n.  And on its face, \xc2\xa72(B) merely tells state officials that they are authorized to do something that they were, by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s con- cession, already authorized to do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court therefore properly rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, recognizing that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume \xc2\xa72B will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 23.  Before reaching that conclusion, however, the Court goes to great length to assuage fears that \xe2\x80\x9cstate officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their immigration status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  Of course, any investigatory detention, including one under \xc2\xa72(B), may become an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. seizur[e],\xe2\x80\x9d U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt.

But that has nothing to do with this case, in which the Government claims that \xc2\xa72(B) is pre-empted by federal immigration law, not that anyone\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFourth Amendment rights have been violated.  And I know of no reason why a protracted detention that does not violate the \n \nFourth Amendment would contradict or conflict with any federal immigration law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa76\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cA peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

See \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x933883.  If an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is \xe2\x80\x9cremovable\xe2\x80\x9d by reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not required to make an arrest.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary contention is that \xc2\xa76 is pre-empted by federal immigration law because it allows state officials to make arrests \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to federal priorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 53.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion focuses on limits that Congress has placed on federal officials\xe2\x80\x99 authority to arrest remov- able aliens and the possibility that state officials will make arrests \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve [Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s] own immigration policy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any input from the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course on this pre-enforcement record there is no reason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal immigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of not wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed offenses that make them removable).  As Arizona points out, federal law expressly provides that state officers may \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(B); and \xe2\x80\x9ccooperation\xe2\x80\x9d requires neither identical efforts nor prior federal approval.  It is consistent with the Arizona statute, and with the \xe2\x80\x9ccooperat[ive]\xe2\x80\x9d system that Congress has created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien, contact federal immigration authorities, and follow their lead on what to do next.  And it is an assault on logic to say that identifying a removable alien and holding him for federal determination of whether he should be removed \xe2\x80\x9cviolates the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s detention does not represent commencement of the removal process unless the Federal Government makes it so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that is not the most important point.  The most important point is that, as we have discussed, Arizona is entitled to have \xe2\x80\x9cits own immigration policy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including a more rigorous enforcement policy\xe2\x80\x94so long as that does not conflict with federal law.  The Court says, as though the point is utterly dispositive, that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15.  It is not a federal crime, to be sure.  But there is no reason Arizona cannot make it a state crime for a removable alien (or any illegal alien, for that matter) to remain present in Arizona.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court quotes \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71226(a), which provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1357(a)(2) also provides that a federal immigration official \xe2\x80\x9cshall have power without warrant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any [federal immigration] law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  But statutory limitations upon the actions of federal officers in enforcing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 power to protect its borders do not on their face apply to the actions of state officers in enforcing the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to protect its borders.  There is no more reason to read these provisions as implying that state officials are subject to similar limitations than there is to read them as implying that only federal officials may arrest removable aliens.  And in any event neither implication would constitute the sort of clear elimination of the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power that our cases demand.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court raises concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary harassment of some aliens .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whom federal officials determine should not be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  But we have no license to assume, without any support in the record, that Arizona officials would use their arrest authority under \xc2\xa76 to harass anyone.  And it makes no difference that federal officials might \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine [that some unlawfully present aliens] should not be removed,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  They may well determine not to remove from the United States aliens who have no right to be here; but unless and until these aliens have been given the right to remain, Arizona is entitled to arrest them and at least bring them to federal officials\xe2\x80\x99 attention, which is all that \xc2\xa76 necessarily entails.  (In my view, the State can go further than this, and punish them for their unlawful entry and presence in Arizona.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government complains that state officials might not heed \xe2\x80\x9cfederal priorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed they might not, particularly if those priorities include willful blindness or delib- erate inattention to the presence of removable aliens in Arizona.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s whole complaint\xe2\x80\x94the reason this law was passed and this case has arisen\xe2\x80\x94is that the citizens of Arizona believe federal priorities are too lax.  The State has the sovereign power to protect its borders more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal prohibition.  The Executive\xe2\x80\x99s policy choice of lax federal enforcement does not constitute such a prohibition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa73\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to any violation of federal law, a person is guilty of willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document if the person is in violation of 8 [U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa71304(e) or \xc2\xa71306(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0B. 1070, \xc2\xa73(A), as amended, Ariz.

Much more is that so when, as here, the State is protecting its own interest, the integrity of its borders.  And we have said that explicitly with regard to illegal immigration: \xe2\x80\x9cDespite the exclusive federal control of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders, we cannot conclude that the States are without any power to deter the influx of persons entering the United States against federal law, and whose numbers might have a discernible impact on traditional state concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Plyler v.

But that case did not, as the Court believes, establish a \xe2\x80\x9cfield preemption\xe2\x80\x9d that implicitly eliminates the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign power to exclude those whom federal law excludes.  It held that the States are not permitted to establish \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or auxiliary\xe2\x80\x9d registration requirements for aliens.  312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  But \xc2\xa73 does not establish additional or auxiliary registration requirements.  It merely makes a violation of state law the very same failure to register and failure to carry evidence of registration that are violations of federal law.  Hines does not prevent the State from relying on the federal registration system as \xe2\x80\x9can available aid in the enforcement of a number of statutes of the state applicable to aliens whose constitutional validity has not been questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 75\xe2\x80\x9376 (Stone, J., dissenting).  One such statute is Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law forbidding illegal aliens to collect unemployment benefits, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa723\xe2\x80\x93781(B) (West 2012).  To enforce that and other laws that validly turn on alien status, Arizona has, in Justice Stone\xe2\x80\x99s words, an interest in knowing \xe2\x80\x9cthe number and whereabouts of aliens within the state\xe2\x80\x9d and in having \xe2\x80\x9ca means of their identification,\xe2\x80\x9d 312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75.  And it can punish the aliens\xe2\x80\x99 failure to comply with the provisions of federal law that make that knowledge and identification possible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn some areas of uniquely federal concern\xe2\x80\x94e.g., fraud in a federal administrative process (Buckman Co. v.

But the federal alien registration system is certainly not of uniquely federal interest.  States, private entities, and individuals rely on the federal registration system (including the E-Verify program) on a regular basis.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate in- terest in protecting (among other things) its unemployment-benefits system is an entirely adequate basis for making the violation of federal registration and carry requirements a violation of state law as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court points out, however, ante, at 11, that in some respects the state law exceeds the punishments prescribed by federal law: It rules out probation and pardon, which are available under federal law.  The answer is that it makes no difference.  Illegal immigrants who violate \xc2\xa73 violate Arizona law.  It is one thing to say that the Supremacy Clause prevents Arizona law from excluding those whom federal law admits.  It is quite something else to say that a violation of Arizona law cannot be punished more severely than a violation of federal law.  Especially where (as here) the State is defending its own sovereign interests, there is no precedent for such a limitation.  The sale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state law as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the state penalties cannot exceed the federal.  As I have discussed, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cfield preemption\xe2\x80\x9d cannot establish a prohibition of additional state penalties in the area of immigration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government also suggests that \xc2\xa73 poses an obstacle to the administration of federal immigration law, see Brief for United States 31\xe2\x80\x9333, but \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no conflict in terms, and no possibility of such conflict, [if] the state statute makes federal law its own,\xe2\x80\x9d California v.

That seems to me entirely appropriate when the State uses the federal law (as it must) as the criterion for the exercise of its own power, and the implementation of its own policies of excluding those who do not belong there.  What I do fear\xe2\x80\x94and what Arizona and the States that support it fear\xe2\x80\x94is that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal policies\xe2\x80\x9d of nonenforcement will leave the States helpless before those evil effects of illegal immigration that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion dutifully recites in its prologue (ante, at 6) but leaves unremedied in its disposition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa75(C)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform work as an employee or independent contractor in this state.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0B. 1070, \xc2\xa75(C), as amended, Ariz.

Bica, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351 (1976)\n, which involved a California law providing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]o employer shall knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 352 (quoting California Labor Code Ann. \xc2\xa72805(a)).  This Court concluded that the California law was not pre-empted, as Congress had neither occupied the field of \xe2\x80\x9cregulation of employment of illegal aliens\xe2\x80\x9d nor expressed \xe2\x80\x9cthe clear and manifest purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of displacing such state regulation.  Id., at 356\xe2\x80\x93357 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, at the time De\xc2\xa0Canas was decided, \xc2\xa75(C) would have been indubitably lawful.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe only relevant change is that Congress has since enacted its own restrictions on employers who hire illegal aliens, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a, in legislation that also includes some civil (but no criminal) penalties on illegal aliens who accept unlawful employment.  The Court concludes from this (reasonably enough) \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13.  But that is not the same as a deliberate choice to prohibit the States from imposing criminal penalties.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent with regard to exclusion of state law need not be guessed at, but is found in the law\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision, which excludes \xe2\x80\x9cany State or local law impos- ing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2) (emphasis added).  Common sense, reflected in the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, suggests that the specification of pre-emption for laws punishing \xe2\x80\x9cthose who employ\xe2\x80\x9d implies the lack of pre-emption for other laws, including laws punishing \xe2\x80\x9cthose who seek or accept employment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court has no credible response to this.  It quotes our jurisprudence to the effect that an \xe2\x80\x9cexpress pre-emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14 (quoting Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 861, \n869 (2000)\n (internal quotation marks omitted)).  True enough\xe2\x80\x94conflict preemption principles.  It then goes on say that since \xe2\x80\x9cCongress decided it would be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized employment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Congress chose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  For \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]here a comprehensive federal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regulated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., \n\n485 U.S. 495, \n503 (1988)\n).  All that is a classic description not of conflict pre-emption but of field pre-emption, which (concededly) does not occur beyond the terms of an express pre-emption provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court concludes that \xc2\xa75(C) \xe2\x80\x9cwould interfere with the careful balance struck by Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15, (another field pre-emption notion, by the way) but that is easy to say and impossible to demonstrate.  The Court relies primarily on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roposals to make unauthorized work a criminal offense were debated and discussed during the long process of drafting [the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ut Congress rejected them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  There is no more reason to believe that this rejection was expressive of a desire that there be no sanctions on employees, than expressive of a desire that such sanctions be left to the States.  To tell the truth, it was most likely expressive of what inaction ordinarily expresses: nothing at all.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cna\xc3\xafve assumption that the failure of a bill to make it out of committee, or to be adopted when reported to the floor, is the same as a congressional rejection of what the bill contained.\xe2\x80\x9d  Crosby v.

Of course there is no reason why the Federal Executive\xe2\x80\x99s need to allocate its scarce enforcement resources should disable Arizona from devoting its resources to illegal immigration in Arizona that in its view the Federal Executive has given short shrift.  Despite Congress\xe2\x80\x99s prescription that \xe2\x80\x9cthe immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,\xe2\x80\x9d IRCA \xc2\xa7115, \n\n100Stat.\n3384, Arizona asserts without contradiction and with supporting citations:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the last decade federal enforcement efforts have focused primarily on areas in California and Texas, leaving Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s border to suffer from comparative neglect.

Indeed, over the past decade, over a third of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s illegal border crossings occurred in Arizona.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 2\xe2\x80\x933 (footnote omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tMust Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect its borders yield to the reality that Congress has provided inadequate funding for federal enforcement\xe2\x80\x94or, even worse, to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s unwise targeting of that funding?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut leave that aside.

But there has come to pass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and the States that support it predicted: A Federal Government that does not want to enforce the immigration laws as written, and leaves the States\xe2\x80\x99 borders unprotected against immigrants whom those laws would exclude.  So the issue is a stark one.  Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to enforce the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s immigration laws?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA good way of answering that question is to ask: Would the States conceivably have entered into the Union if the Constitution itself contained the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding?  Today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment surely fails that test.  At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the delegates contended with \xe2\x80\x9cthe jealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Records of the Federal Convention 19 (M.

Arizona bears the brunt of the country\xe2\x80\x99s illegal immigration problem.  Its citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy.  Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so.  Thousands of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants\xe2\x80\x94including not just children but men and women under 30\xe2\x80\x94are now assured immunity from enforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Ari- zona citizens for employment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArizona has moved to protect its sovereignty\xe2\x80\x94not in contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance with it.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x931051(B) (West 2012).

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding on \xc2\xa75(C) is inconsistent with De Canas v. Bica, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351 (1976)\n, which held that employment regulation, even of aliens unlawfully present in the country, is an area of traditional state concern.  Because state police powers are implicated here, our precedents require us to presume that federal law does not displace state law unless Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to do so is clear and manifest.  I do not believe Congress has spoken with the requisite clarity to justify invalidation of \xc2\xa75(C).  Nor do I believe that \xc2\xa76 is invalid.  Like \xc2\xa72(B), \xc2\xa76 adds virtually nothing to the authority that Arizona law enforcement officers already exercise.  And whatever little authority they have gained is consistent with federal law. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tSection 2(B)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough \xc2\xa72(B) of the Arizona law has occasioned much controversy, it adds nothing to the authority that Arizona law enforcement officers, like officers in all other States, already possess under federal law.  For that reason, I agree with the Court that \xc2\xa72(B) is not pre-empted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 2(B) quite clearly does not expand the authority of Arizona officers to make stops or arrests.  It is triggered only when a \xe2\x80\x9clawful stop, detention or arrest [is] made . . . in the enforcement of any other [state or local] law or ordinance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x931051(B) (emphasis added).  Section 2(B) thus comes into play only when an officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a person has committed a nonimmigration offense.  Arizona officers plainly possessed this authority before \xc2\xa72(B) took effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 2(B) also does not expand the authority of Arizona officers to inquire about the immigration status of persons who are lawfully detained.  When a person is stopped or arrested and \xe2\x80\x9creasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72(B) instructs Arizona officers to make a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attempt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhen practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d to ascertain that person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x931051(B).  Even before the Arizona Legislature enacted \xc2\xa72(B), federal law permitted state and local officers to make such inquiries.  In \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(A), Congress has made clear that state and local governments need not enter into formal agreements with the Federal Government in order \xe2\x80\x9cto communicate with the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration status of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  In addition, Congress has mandated that neither the Federal Government nor any state or local government may \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [the Federal Government] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71373(a); see also \xc2\xa71644 (providing that \xe2\x80\x9cno State or local government entity may be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from [the Federal Government] information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  And while these provisions preserve the authority of state and local officers to seek immigration-status information from the Federal Government, another federal statute, \xc2\xa71373(c), requires that the Federal Government respond to any such inquiries \xe2\x80\x9cby providing the requested verification or status information.\xe2\x80\x9d  It comes as no surprise, therefore, that many States and localities permit their law enforcement officers to make the kinds of inquiries that \xc2\xa72(B) prescribes.  See App. 294\xe2\x80\x93298 (reporting that officers in 59 surveyed state and local jurisdictions \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally\xe2\x80\x9d ask arrestees about their immigration status while 34 do not and that officers in 78 jurisdictions \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally\xe2\x80\x9d inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when they believe an arrestee to be an undocumented alien while only 17 do not).  Congress has invited state and local governments to make immigration-related inquiries and has even obligated the Federal Government to respond.  Through \xc2\xa72(B), Arizona has taken Congress up on that invitation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States does not deny that officers may, at their own discretion, inquire about the immigration status of persons whom they lawfully detain.  Instead, the United States argues that \xc2\xa72(B) is pre-empted because it impedes federal-state cooperation by mandating that officers verify the immigration status of every detained person if there is reason to believe that the person is unlawfully present in the country.  The United States claims that \xc2\xa72(B)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate runs contrary to federal law in that it \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes officers from taking [the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s] priorities and discretion into account.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 50.  \xe2\x80\x9c[B]y interposing a mandatory state law between state and local officers and their federal counterparts,\xe2\x80\x9d writes the United States, \xc2\xa72(B) \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the ac- complishment of the federal requirement of cooperation and the full effectuation of the enforcement judgment and discretion Congress has vested in the Executive Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe underlying premise of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 argument seems to be that state and local officers, when left to their own devices, generally take federal enforcement priorities into account.  But there is no reason to think that this premise is true.  And even if it were, it would not follow that \xc2\xa72(B)\xe2\x80\x99s blanket mandate is at odds with federal law.  Nothing in the relevant federal statutes requires state and local officers to consider the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s priorities before requesting verification of a person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status.  Neither \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S. C. \xc2\xa71357(g)(10) nor \xc2\xa71373(a) conditions the right of state and local officers to communicate with the Federal Government on their first taking account of its priorities.  Nor does \xc2\xa71373(c) condition the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to answer requests for in- formation on the sensitivity of state and local officers to its enforcement discretion.  In fact, \xc2\xa71373(c) dictates that the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cshall respond\xe2\x80\x9d to any inquiry seeking verification of immigration status, and that command applies whether or not the requesting officer has bothered to consider federal priorities.  Because no federal statute requires such consideration, \xc2\xa72(B) does not conflict with federal law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, it is hard to see how state and local offi- cers could proceed in conformity with the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement priorities without making an inquiry into a suspected alien\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status.  For example, one of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s highest priorities is the apprehension and removal of aliens who have failed to comply with a final order of removal.  See App. 108.  How can an officer identify those persons without first in- quiring about their status?  At bottom, the discretion that ultimately matters is not whether to verify a person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status but whether to act once the person\xe2\x80\x99s status is known.  For that reason, \xc2\xa72(B)\xe2\x80\x99s verification requirement is not contrary to federal law because the Federal Government retains the discretion that matters most\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93that is, the discretion to enforce the law in par- ticular cases.  If an Arizona officer contacts the Federal Government to verify a person\xe2\x80\x99s immigration status and federal records reveal that the person is in the coun- try unlawfully, the Federal Government decides, presumably based on its enforcement priorities, whether to have the person released or transferred to federal custody.  Enforcement discretion thus lies with the Federal Government, not with Arizona.  Nothing in \xc2\xa72(B) suggests otherwise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States\xe2\x80\x99 attack on \xc2\xa72(B) is quite remarkable.  The United States suggests that a state law may be pre-empted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or regulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s current enforcement priorities.  Those priorities, however, are not law.  They are nothing more than agency policy.  I am aware of no decision of this Court recognizing that mere policy can have pre-emptive force.  Cf. Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 298, \n330 (1994)\n (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Branch communications that express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot render unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise valid, congressionally condoned\xe2\x80\x9d state law).  If \xc2\xa72(B) were pre-empted at the present time because it is out of sync with the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s current priorities, would it be unpre-empted at some time in the future if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s priorities changed?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike most law enforcement agencies, ICE does not set out inflexible rules for its officers to follow.  To the con- trary, it provides a list of factors to guide its officers\xe2\x80\x99 enforcement discretion on a case-by-case basis.  See Memorandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field Office Directors et\xc2\xa0al., p. 4 (June 17, 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis list is not exhaustive and no one factor is determinative.  ICE offi- cers, agents, and attorneys should always consider prosecutorial discretion on a case-by-case basis.  The decisions should be based on the totality of the circumstances, with the goal of conforming to ICE\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement priorities\xe2\x80\x9d).  Among those factors is \xe2\x80\x9cthe agency\xe2\x80\x99s civil immigration enforcement priorities,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., which change from administration to administration.  If accepted, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emption argument would give the Executive unprecedented power to invalidate state laws that do not meet with its approval, even if the state laws are otherwise consistent with federal statutes and duly promulgated regulations.  This argument, to say the least, is fundamentally at odds with our federal system.       \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt has been suggested that \xc2\xa72(B) will cause some persons who are lawfully stopped to be detained in violation of their constitutional rights while a prolonged investigation of their immigration status is undertaken.  But nothing on the face of the law suggests that it will be enforced in a way that violates the \n \nFourth Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The law instructs officers to make a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attempt\xe2\x80\x9d to investigate immigration status, and this language is best understood as incorporating the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s standard of reasonableness.  Indeed, the Arizona Legislature has directed that \xc2\xa72(B) \xe2\x80\x9cshall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz.

To take a common situation, suppose that a car is stopped for speeding, a nonimmigration offense.  (Recall that \xc2\xa72(B) comes into play only where a stop or arrest is made for a nonimmigration offense.)  Suppose also that the officer who makes the stop subsequently acquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver entered the country illegally, which is a federal crime.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is well established that state and local officers generally have authority to make stops and arrests for violations of federal criminal laws.  See, e.g., Miller v. United States, \n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301, \n305 (1958)\n; United States v. Di Re, \n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581, \n589 (1948)\n.  I see no reason why this principle should not apply to immigration crimes as well.  Lower courts have so held.  See, e.g., Estrada v. Rhode Island, 594 F.\xc2\xa03d 56, 65 (CA1 2010) (upholding the lawfulness of a detention because the officer had an objectively reason- able belief that the arrestees \xe2\x80\x9chad committed immigra- tion violations\xe2\x80\x9d); United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176 F.\xc2\xa03d 1294, 1296 (CA10 1999) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cstate law-enforcement officers have the general authority to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal immigration laws\xe2\x80\x9d); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F.\xc2\xa02d 468, 475 (CA9 1983), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.\xc2\xa03d 1037 (1999) (en banc) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal law does not preclude local enforcement of the criminal provisions\xe2\x80\x9d of federal immigration law).  And the United States, consistent with the position long taken by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice, does not contend otherwise.  See Brief for United States 55, n. 33; see also Memorandum from OLC to the Attorney General (Apr. 3, 2002), App. 268\xe2\x80\x93273; Assistance by State and Local Police in Apprehending Illegal Aliens, 20 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 26 (1996).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore importantly, no federal statute casts doubt on this authority.  To be sure, there are a handful of statutes that purport to authorize state and local officers to make immigration-related arrests in certain situations.  See, e.g., \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a)(10) (providing for the extension of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d immigration enforcement authority to state and local officers in the event of an \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent mass in- flux of aliens arriving off the coast\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71252c(a) (provid- ing authority to arrest criminal aliens who had illegally reentered the country but only after consultation with the Federal Government); \xc2\xa71324(c) (providing authority to make arrests for transporting and harboring certain aliens).  But a grant of federal arrest authority in some cases does not manifest a clear congressional intent to displace the States\xe2\x80\x99 police powers in all other cases. Without more, such an inference is too weak to overcome our presumption against pre-emption where traditional state police powers are at stake.  Accordingly, in our hypothetical case, the Arizona officer may arrest the driver for violating \xc2\xa71325(a) if the officer has probable cause.  And if the officer has reasonable suspicion, the officer may detain the driver, to the extent permitted by the \n \nFourth Amendment, while the question of illegal entry is investigated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have held that a detention based on reasonable suspicion that the detainee committed a particular crime \xe2\x80\x9ccan become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Illinois v. Caballes, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405, \n407 (2005)\n.  But if during the course of a stop an officer acquires suspicion that a de- tainee committed a different crime, the detention may be extended for a reasonable time to verify or dispel that suspicion.  Cf. Muehler v. Mena, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 93, \n101 (2005)\n (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cno additional \n \nFourth Amendment justification\xe2\x80\x9d was required because any questioning concerning immigration status did not prolong the detention).  In our hypothetical case, therefore, if the officer, after initially stopping the car for speeding, has a reasonable suspicion that the driver entered the country illegally, the officer may investigate for evidence of illegal entry.  But the length and nature of this investigation must remain within the limits set out in our \n \nFourth Amendment cases.  An investigative stop, if prolonged, can become an arrest and thus require probable cause.  See Caballes, supra, at 407.  Similarly, if a person is moved from the site of the stop, probable cause will likely be required.  See Hayes v. Florida, \n\n470 U. S. 811, \n816 (1985)\n (holding that the line be- tween detention and arrest is crossed \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the police, without probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a person from his home or other place in which he is entitled to be and transport him to the police station, where he is detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf properly implemented, \xc2\xa72(B) should not lead to fed- eral constitutional violations, but there is no denying that enforcement of \xc2\xa72(B) will multiply the occasions on which sensitive \n \nFourth Amendment issues will crop up.  These civil-liberty concerns, I take it, are at the heart of most objections to \xc2\xa72(B).  Close and difficult questions will in- evitably arise as to whether an officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that a person who is stopped for some other reason entered the country illegally, and there is a risk that citizens, lawful permanent residents, and others who are lawfully present in the country will be detained.  To mitigate this risk, Arizona could issue guidance to officers detailing the circumstances that typically give rise to reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence.  And in the spirit of the federal-state cooperation that the United States champions, the Federal Government could share its own guidelines.  Arizona could also provide officers with a nonexclusive list containing forms of identification sufficient under \xc2\xa72(B) to dispel any suspicion of unlawful presence.  If Arizona accepts licenses from most States as proof of legal status, the problem of roadside detentions will be greatly mitigated.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tSection 3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI agree that \xc2\xa73 is pre-empted because, like the Court, I read the opinion in Hines to require that result.  Although there is some ambiguity in Hines, the Court largely spoke in the language of field pre-emption.  The Court explained that where Congress \xe2\x80\x9chas enacted a complete scheme of regulation and has therein provided a standard for the registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  312 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.  In finding the Pennsylvania alien-registration law pre-empted, the Court observed that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cprovided a standard for alien registration in a single integrated and all-embracing system\xe2\x80\x9d and that its intent was \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 74.  If we credit our holding in Hines that Congress has enacted \xe2\x80\x9ca single in- tegrated and all-embracing system\xe2\x80\x9d of alien registration and that States cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccomplement\xe2\x80\x9d that system or \xe2\x80\x9cenforce additional or auxiliary regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 66\xe2\x80\x9367, 74, then Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to impose additional, state-law penalties for violations of federal registration requirements must be invalidated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tSection 5(C)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile I agree that \xc2\xa73 is pre-empted, I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to strike down \xc2\xa75(C).  I do so in large measure because the Court fails to give the same solicitude to our decision in De Canas, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351\n, as it is willing to give our decision in Hines.  In De Canas, the Court upheld against a pre-emption challenge a state law imposing fines on employers that hired aliens who were unlawfully present in the United States.  The Court explained that the mere fact that \xe2\x80\x9caliens are the subject of a state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 355.  The Court emphasized instead that \xe2\x80\x9cStates possess broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 356.  In light of that broad authority, the Court declared that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly a demonstration that complete ouster of state power . . . was \xe2\x80\x98the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 would justify\xe2\x80\x9d the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cstate regulation designed to protect vital state interests must give way to paramount federal legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 357 (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 431, \n449 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn areas of traditional state regulation, [the Court] assume[s] that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless Congress has made such an intention \xe2\x80\x98clear and manifest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (some internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court now tells us that times have changed.

Having no express statement of congressional intent to support its analysis, the Court infers from stale legislative history and from the comprehensiveness of the federal scheme that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress made a deliberate choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthorized employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.  Because \xc2\xa75(C) imposes such penalties, the Court concludes that it stands as an obstacle to the method of enforcement chosen by Congress.  Ante, at 15.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe one thing that is clear from the federal scheme is that Congress chose not to impose federal criminal penalties on aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work.  But that does not mean that Congress also chose to pre-empt state criminal penalties.  The inference is plausible, but far from necessary.  As we have said before, the \xe2\x80\x9cdecision not to adopt a regulation\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of a regulation prohibiting all States and their political subdivisions from adopting such a regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 51, \n65 (2002)\n.  With any statutory scheme, Congress chooses to do some things and not others.  If that alone were enough to demonstrate pre-emptive intent, there would be little left over for the States to regulate, especially now that federal authority reaches so far and wide.  States would occupy tiny islands in a sea of federal power.  This explains why state laws implicating traditional state powers are not pre-empted unless there is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest\xe2\x80\x9d congressional intention to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot only is there little evidence that Congress intended to pre-empt state laws like \xc2\xa75(C), there is some evidence that Congress intended the opposite result.  In making it unlawful for employers to hire unauthorized aliens, see \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(a), Congress made it clear that \xe2\x80\x9cany State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws)\xe2\x80\x9d upon employers was pre-empted, \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2).  Noticeably absent is any similar directive pre-empting state or local laws targeting aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized employment.  Given that Congress expressly pre-empted certain state and local laws pertaining to employers but remained silent about laws pertaining to employees, one could infer that Congress intended to preserve state and local authority to regulate the employee side of the equation.  At the very least, it raises serious doubts about whether Congress intended to pre-empt such authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court dismisses any inferences that might be drawn from the express pre-emption provision.  See ante, at 14.  But even though the existence of that provision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles\xe2\x80\x9d or impose a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special burden\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d against pre-emption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 861\n\xe2\x80\x93870 (2000), it is still probative of congressional intent.  And it is the intent of Congress that is the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate touchstone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, \n\n375 U.\xc2\xa0S. 96, \n103 (1963)\n.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court infers from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to impose federal criminal penalties that Congress intended to pre-empt state criminal penalties.  But given that the express pre-emption provision covers only state and local laws regulating employers, one could just as well infer that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state or local laws aimed at alien employees who unlawfully seek or obtain work.  Surely Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to extend its express pre-emption provision to state or local laws like \xc2\xa75(C) is more probative of its intent on the subject of pre-emption than its decision not to impose federal criminal penalties for unauthorized work.  In any event, the point I wish to emphasize is that inferences can be drawn either way.  There are no necessary inferences that point decisively for or against pre-emption.  Therefore, if we take seriously that state employment regulation is a traditional state concern and can be pre-empted only on a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest\xe2\x80\x9d congressional intent as required by De Canas, then \xc2\xa75(C) must survive.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur precedents establish that a high threshold must be met if a state law is to be pre-empted for conflicting with the purposes of a fed- eral Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks omitted).  I do not believe the United States has surmounted that barrier here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tSection 6\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI also disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that \xc2\xa76 is pre-empted.  This provision adds little to the authority that Arizona officers already possess, and whatever additional authority it confers is consistent with federal law.  Section 6 amended an Arizona statute that authorizes warrantless arrests.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x933883 (West 2010).  Before \xc2\xa76 was added, that statute already permitted arrests without a warrant for felonies, misdemeanors committed in the arresting officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence, petty offenses, and certain traffic-related criminal violations.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x933883(A)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).  Largely duplicating the authority already conferred by these prior subsections, \xc2\xa76 added a new subsection, \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x933883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011), that authorizes officers to make warrantless arrests on probable cause that the arrestee has committed a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic offense\xe2\x80\x9d for which the arrestee is removable from the United States.  A \xe2\x80\x9cpublic offense\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as conduct that is punishable by imprisonment or a fine according to the law of the State where the conduct occurred and that would be punishable under Arizona law had the conduct occurred in Arizona.  See \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93105(27).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn what way, if any, does \xc2\xa76 enlarge the arrest authority of Arizona officers?  It has been suggested that \xc2\xa76 confers new authority in the following three circumstances: (1) where the arrestee committed but has not been charged with committing an offense in another State; (2) where the officer has probable cause to believe the arrestee committed an offense for which he was previously arrested but not prosecuted; and (3) where the arrestee committed but has already served the sentence for a removable offense.  641 F.\xc2\xa03d 359, 361 (CA9 2011). These are exceedingly narrow categories, involving circumstances that will rarely arise.  But such cases are possible, and therefore we must decide whether there are circumstances under which fed- eral law precludes a state officer from making an arrest based on probable cause that the arrestee committed a removable offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe idea that state and local officers may carry out arrests in the service of federal law is not unprecedented.  As previously noted, our cases establish that state and local officers may make warrantless arrests for violations of federal law and that \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of an applicable federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Di Re, 332 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 589; see also Miller, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 305 (stating that, where a state officer makes an arrest based on fed- eral law, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawfulness of the arrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to state law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, given the premise, which I understand both the United States and the Court to accept, that state and local officers do have inherent authority to make arrests in aid of fed- eral law, we must ask whether Congress has done anything to curtail or pre-empt that authority in this particular case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeither the United States nor the Court goes so far as to say that state and local officers have no power to arrest criminal aliens based on their removability.  To do so would fly in the face of \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(g)(10).  Under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71357(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(9), the Federal Government may enter into formal agreements with States and municipalities under which their officers may perform certain duties of a fed- eral immigration officer.  But \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(B) makes clear that States and municipalities need not enter into those agreements \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise to cooperate . . . in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  It goes without saying that state and local officers could not provide meaningful cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and ultimate removal of criminal aliens without some power to make arrests.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough \xc2\xa71357(g)(10) contemplates state and local authority to apprehend criminal aliens for the purpose of removal, the Court rejects out of hand any possibility that officers could exercise that authority without federal direction.  Despite acknowledging that there is \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity as to what constitutes cooperation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says that \xe2\x80\x9cno coherent understanding of the term would incorporate the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien for being removable absent any request, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  The Court adopts an unnecessarily stunted view of cooperation.  No one would say that a state or local officer has failed to cooperate by making an on-the-spot arrest to enforce federal law.  Unsolicited aid is not necessarily uncooperative.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, were an officer to persist in making an arrest that the officer knows is unwanted, such conduct would not count as cooperation.  But nothing in the relevant federal statutes suggests that Congress does not want aliens who have committed removable offenses to be arrested.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  To the contrary, \xc2\xa71226(c)(1) commands that the Executive \xe2\x80\x9cshall take into custody any alien\xe2\x80\x9d who is deportable for having committed a specified offense.  And \xc2\xa71226(c)(2) substantially limits the circumstances under which the Executive has discretion to release aliens held in custody under paragraph (1).  So if an officer arrests an alien who is removable for having committed one of the crimes listed in \xc2\xa71226(c)(1), the Federal Government is obligated to take the alien into custody.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat Congress generally requires the Executive to take custody of criminal aliens casts considerable doubt on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern that \xc2\xa76 is an obstacle to the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion.  The Court claims that the authority conferred by \xc2\xa76 \xe2\x80\x9ccould be exercised without any input from the Federal Government about whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case\xe2\x80\x9d and that this \xe2\x80\x9cwould allow the State to achieve its own immigration policy,\xe2\x80\x9d resulting in the \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary harassment of some aliens . . . whom federal officials determine should not be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  But \xc2\xa71226(c)(1) belies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fear.  In many, if not most, cases involving aliens who are removable for having committed criminal offenses, Congress has left the Executive no discretion but to take the alien into custody.  State and local officers do not frus- trate the removal process by arresting criminal aliens.  The Executive retains complete discretion over whether those aliens are ultimately removed.  And once the Fed- eral Government makes a determination that a particular criminal alien will not be removed, then Arizona officers are presumably no longer authorized under \xc2\xa76 to arrest the alien.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, not all offenses for which officers have authority to arrest under \xc2\xa76 are covered by \xc2\xa71226(c)(1).  As for aliens who have committed those offenses, Congress has given the Executive discretion under \xc2\xa71226(a) over whether to arrest and detain them pending a decision on removal.  But the mere fact that the Executive has enforcement discretion cannot mean that the exercise of state police powers in support of federal law is automatically pre-empted.  If that were true, then state and local officers could never make arrests to enforce any federal statute because the Executive always has at least some general discretion over the enforcement of federal law as a practical matter.  But even assuming that the express statutory grant of discretion in \xc2\xa71226(a) somehow indicates a congressional desire to pre-empt unilateral state and local authority to arrest criminal aliens covered by that provision, \xc2\xa76 is not pre-empted on its face given its substantial overlap with \xc2\xa71226(c)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt bears emphasizing that \xc2\xa76 does not mandate the warrantless apprehension of all aliens who have committed crimes for which they are removable.  Instead, it only grants state and local officers permission to make such arrests.  The trouble with this premature, facial challenge is that it affords Arizona no opportunity to implement its law in a way that would avoid any potential conflicts with federal law.  For example, Arizona could promulgate guidelines or regulations limiting the arrest authority conferred by \xc2\xa76 to the crimes specified in \xc2\xa71226(c)(1).  And to the extent \xc2\xa71226(c)(1) is unclear about which exact crimes are covered,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t Arizona could go even further and identify specific crimes for which there is no doubt an alien would be removable.  The point is that there are plenty of permissible applications of \xc2\xa76, and the Court should not invalidate the statute at this point without at least some indication that Arizona has implemented it in a manner at odds with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear and manifest intent.  We have said that a facial challenge to a statute is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Salerno, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 739, \n745 (1987)\n; see also Anderson v. Edwards, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 143\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (1995) (applying the Salerno standard in a pre-emption case).  As to \xc2\xa76, I do not believe the United States has carried that heavy burden.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Court tells us that \xc2\xa76 conflicts with federal law because it provides state and local officers with \xe2\x80\x9ceven greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability than Congress has given to trained federal immigration officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  The Court points to \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71357(a)(2), which empowers \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized\xe2\x80\x9d offi- cers and employees of ICE to make arrests without a fed- eral warrant if \xe2\x80\x9cthe alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because \xc2\xa76 would allow Arizona officers to make arrests \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or the alien is likely to escape,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 17, the Court concludes that \xc2\xa76 is an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objectives.  But \xc2\xa76 is an obstacle only to the extent it conflicts with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear and manifest intent to preclude state and local officers from making arrests except where a federal warrant has issued or the arrestee is likely to escape.  By granting warrantless arrest authority to federal officers, Congress has not manifested an unmistakable intent to strip state and local officers of their warrantless arrest authority under state law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLikewise, limitations on federal arrest authority do not mean that the arrest authority of state and local officers must be similarly limited.  Our opinion in Miller, \n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301\n, is instructive.  In that case, a District of Columbia officer, accompanied by a federal officer, made an arrest based on a suspected federal narcotics offense.  Id., at 303\xe2\x80\x93304.  The federal officer did not have statutory authorization to arrest without a warrant, but the local officer did.  Id., at 305.  We held that District of Columbia law dictated the lawfulness of the arrest.  Id., at 305\xe2\x80\x93306.  Where a state or local officer makes a warrantless arrest to enforce federal law, we said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawfulness of the arrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 305.  Under \xc2\xa76, an Arizona officer may be authorized to make an arrest that a federal officer may not be authorized to make under \xc2\xa71357(a)(2).  As Miller makes clear, that fact alone does not render arrests by state or local officers pursuant to \xc2\xa76 unlawful.  Nor does it manifest a clear congressional intent to displace the exercise of state police powers that are brought to bear in aid of federal law.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0When the Real ID Act takes effect, the Federal Government will no longer accept state forms of identification that fail to meet certain federal requirements.  \xc2\xa7202(a)(1), \n.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x931051(B) (West 2012).

As Justice Scalia notes, ante, at 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), federal law does limit the authority of federal officials to arrest removable aliens, but those statutes do not apply to state officers.  And, federal law expressly recognizes that state officers may \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9capprehension\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9caliens not lawfully present in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71357(g)(10)(B).  Nothing in that statute indicates that such cooperation requires a prior \xe2\x80\x9crequest, approval, or other instruction from the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18 (majority opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 3 of S.\xc2\xa0B. 1070 makes it a crime under Arizona law for an unlawfully present alien to willfully fail to complete or carry an alien registration document in violation of \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71304(e) and \xc2\xa71306(a).  Section 3 simply incorporates federal registration standards.  Unlike the Court, I would not hold that Congress pre-empted the field of enforcing those standards.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur recent cases have frequently rejected field pre-emption in the absence of statutory language expressly requiring it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564, \n617 (1997)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting); see, e.g., New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, \n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405, \n415 (1973)\n.  Here, nothing in the text of the relevant federal statutes indicates that Congress intended enforcement of its registration requirements to be exclusively the province of the Federal Government.  That Congress created a \xe2\x80\x9cfull set of standards governing alien registration,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 10 (majority opinion), merely indicates that it intended the scheme to be capable of working on its own, not that it wanted to preclude the States from enforcing the federal standards.  Hines v. Davidowitz, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52 (1941)\n, is not to the contrary.  As Justice Scalia explains, ante, at 14, Hines at most holds that federal law pre-empts the States from creating additional registration requirements.  But here, Arizona is merely seeking to enforce the very registration requirements that Congress created.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 5(C) of S.\xc2\xa0B. 1070 prohibits unlawfully present aliens from knowingly applying for, soliciting, or performing work in Arizona.  Section 5(C) operates only on individuals whom Congress has already declared ineligible to work in the United States.  Nothing in the text of the federal immigration laws prohibits States from imposing their own criminal penalties on such individuals.  Fed- eral law expressly pre-empts States from \xe2\x80\x9cimposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(h)(2) (emphasis added).  But it leaves States free to impose criminal sanctions on the employees themselves.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDespite the lack of any conflict between the ordinary meaning of the Arizona law and that of the federal laws at issue here, the Court holds that various provisions of the Arizona law are pre-empted because they \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hines, supra, at 67.  I have explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d theory of implied pre-emption is inconsistent with the Constitution because it invites courts to engage in freewheeling speculation about congressional purpose that roams well beyond statutory text.  See Wyeth, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2011) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933); Haywood v. Drown, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 729, \n767 (2009)\n (dissenting opinion).  Under the Supremacy Clause, pre-emptive effect is to be given to congressionally enacted laws, not to judicially divined legislative purposes.  See Wyeth, supra, at 604 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Thus, even assuming the existence of some tension between Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law and the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress, I would not hold that any of the provisions of the Arizona law at issue here are pre-empted on that basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
