The following is the memorial and grant offered by the appellees, to maintain the claim:</p>\n<p>"His Excellency, the Governor.  Don Pablo Fontane, an inhabitant and merchant of this place, with due respect, represents your Excellency that in consequence of the orders of his Majesty of 29 March, 1815, in which he has been pleased to grant gratuitously to his faithful subjects of this province lands in proportion to the services rendered by them, and as your petitioner considers himself included in the said royal favor, this government granted to him, under date of 25 June of the present year, in absolute property, as it appears by the document duly annexed, a quantity of land comprehended in a square of four miles, on Trout Creek, of the River St. John; and as it happened that when he went to take possession of the said land, he found it in the possession of Dona Beig Bagely, widow, and this he represents to your Excellency, in order that you be pleased to withdraw the said document of ownership which is annexed, and to grant him another in lieu thereof, for the same quantity of land on another creek, which, issuing from the north head of Indian River westwardly, runs to the northwest.  Therefore your petitioner supplicates your Excellency to consider as returned the mentioned document for concession, and in virtue of the said royal order, to grant him in absolute property the square of four miles of land at the place which he has just designated, as the same is vacant, which favor he hopes to receive from the justice of your Excellency. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 40 U.

S. 231</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is contended that the decree should be reversed, because the evidence is insufficient to prove that the grant was made.  The proof is a certificate of Aguilar, the secretary of the government, which has been ruled to be sufficient, in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/39/334/case.html">United States v. Wiggins,</a></span></em> 14 Pet. 334, and again, at this term, in the case of the <em>United States v. Rodman, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/49/124/case.html#130">49 U. S. 130</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The second objection is that if the grant is proved, it is not in conformity to the royal order of 29 March 1815, by virtue of which it is declared the grant was made.  That royal order has been under the consideration of this Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/51/case.html#96">Percheman\'s Case,</a></span></em> 7 Pet. 96.  In that case, it will be seen, that the petitioner refers in his memorial to the order of 29 March, 1815, and that the governor, in the grant for the land, says:  "In consideration of the provisions of the royal order, under date 29 March last, which is referred to, I do grant to him in absolute property," &amp;c., but the Court (referring to certificates which were annexed to the memorial for the grant, which the grant refers to as certificates annexed) said</p>\n<p>"military service is the foundation of the grant, and the royal order is referred to only as showing that the favorable attention of the King had been directed to the petitioner."</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/51/case.html#96">32 U. S. 7</a></span> Pet. 96.  The Court sustained the grant in that case notwithstanding it was said to have been made in consideration of the royal order of 1815, which limits grants to one hundred acres, and to persons of a particular regiment.  The power in the governor to make a larger grant of land was not thought to be restrained in making a grant to one who was not of the regiment designated in the order and who applied for it on the ground of services.  The reasoning in that decision cannot be shaken.  It applies with full force to the grant now under consideration, the decree of the governor being alike in both cases.  But this has an additional consideration recited in the memorial.  The surrender of another grant previously made for services, recognized by the governor in his acceptance of the retrocession offered by the memorialist.  This is a grant in absolute property.  Though it recites the order of 29 March, 1815, the inducements for making it are considerations which plainly show it was not intended by the governor to be restrained to the number of acres limited by that order. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="232">Page 40 U.
