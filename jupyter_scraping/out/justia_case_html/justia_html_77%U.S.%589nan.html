This second circular, intended obviously for his careful perusal and study throughout, contained, in lieu of the language above cited, from the first one, the following:</p>\n<p>"For your services as above, you will be allowed a commission of 10 percent on the first premiums (cash and notes), and 5 percent on all subsequent renewal premiums <em>so long as you continue the agent of the company.</em>"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff received and acted on this latter paper for about fifteen years, when he was discharged.  He now brought this suit, claiming some $3,000 as the 5 percent commission on the renewal premiums of policies originally made by him as agent which had been received by the company since he was discharged.</p>\n<p>To support this claim, he undertook to prove by other insurance agents that such was the custom as between insurance companies and their agents.  But the court ruled as matter of law that there was an express contracts in the case, and that the custom could not be admitted.</p>\n<p>It also ruled that the later circular was substituted as a new contract instead of the first one, and that its fair construction was to limit the agency to the pleasure of the company, and to terminate the right of the agent to commissions on renewal premiums with the revocation of his agency.</p>\n<p>These rulings, or more particularly the second one, made the error complained of. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="592">Page 77 U.

S. 592</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The right of the insurance company to terminate the agency of the plaintiff at its discretion is not denied by his counsel, nor is there any serious effort to support the offer to prove the custom.  Indeed, if the court was right in holding that the contract between the parties was expressed by the language of the second circular, it is quite clear there was no room for usage, for it is there expressly stated that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="593">Page 77 U. S. 593</a></p><p> the commission on the renewal premiums, like those on the original premiums, was to be paid only so long as the plaintiff continued to be the agent of the company.</p>\n<p>Nor can we doubt for a moment that the later circular must be held to represent the agreement of the parties as to compensation.  After having received that circular and acted on it for fifteen years, received and adjusted his compensation by it, he is estopped to deny that it was the contract under which he acted.  If there was any other contract, it was for him to show it.  He does not do this by producing the circular of the year previous.  If there was anything fraudulent, unfair, or illegal in the new terms offered or in the mode in which he was induced to accept them, he should have shown it, but he has not even attempted it.</p>\n<p>We are therefore clearly of opinion that when it is shown that, as agent of the company, he received and acted upon that circular, he is bound by its terms as the measure of his compensation.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
