Mobile\'s at-large electoral system does not violate the rights of the city\'s Negro voters in contravention of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Racially discriminatory motivation is a necessary ingredient of a Fifteenth Amendment violation.  The Amendment does not entail the right to have Negro candidates elected, but prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to vote "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."  Here, having found that Negroes in Mobile register and vote without hindrance, the courts below erred in believing that appellants invaded the protection of the Fifteenth Amendment.

Where the character of a law is readily explainable on grounds apart from race, as would nearly always be true where, as here, an entire system of local governance is brought into question, disproportionate impact alone cannot be decisive, and courts must look to other evidence to support a finding of discriminatory purpose.

JUSTICE STEWART announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joined.</p>\n<p>The city of Mobile, Ala., has, since 1911, been governed by a City Commission consisting of three members elected by the voters of the city at large.  The question in this case is whether this at-large system of municipal elections violates the rights of Mobile\'s Negro voters in contravention of federal statutory or constitutional law.</p>\n<p>The appellees brought this suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Alabama as a class action on behalf of all Negro citizens of Mobile. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Named as defendants were the city and its three incumbent Commissioners, who are the appellants before this Court.  The complaint alleged that the practice of electing the City Commissioners at large unfairly diluted the voting strength of Negroes in violation of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Following a bench trial, the District Court found that the constitutional rights of the appellees had been violated, entered a judgment in their favor, and ordered that the City Commission be disestablished and replaced by a municipal government consisting of a Mayor and a City Council with members elected from single-member districts.  423 F.Supp. 384. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in its entirety, 571 F.2d 238, agreeing that Mobile\'s at-large elections operated to discriminate against Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, <em>id.</em> at 245, and finding that the remedy formulated by the District Court was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 446 U. S. 59</a></p><p> appropriate.  An appeal was taken to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction, 439 U.S. 815.  The case was originally argued in the 1978 Term, and was reargued in the present Term.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In Alabama, the form of municipal government a city may adopt is governed by state law.  Until 1911, cities not covered by specific legislation were limited to governing themselves through a mayor and city council. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In that year, the Alabama Legislature authorized every large municipality to adopt a commission form of government. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Mobile established its City Commission in the same year, and has maintained that basic system of municipal government ever since.</p>\n<p>The three Commissioners jointly exercise all legislative, executive, and administrative power in the municipality.  They are required after election to designate one of their number as Mayor, a largely ceremonial office, but no formal provision is made for allocating specific executive or administrative duties among the three. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As required by the state law enacted in 1911, each candidate for the Mobile City Commission runs for election in the city at large for a term of four years in one of three numbered posts, and may be elected </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 446 U. S. 60</a></p><p> only by a majority of the total vote.  This is the same basic electoral system that is followed by literally thousands of municipalities and other local governmental units throughout the Nation. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although required by general principles of judicial administration to do so, <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/101/case.html">323 U.

S. 347</a></span> (Brandeis, J., concurring), neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed the complaint\'s statutory claim -- that the Mobile electoral system violates \xc2\xa7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Even a cursory examination of that claim, however, clearly discloses that it adds nothing to the appellees\' complaint.</p>\n<p>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides:</p>\n<p>"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color."</p>\n<p>79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973.  Assuming, for present purposes, that there exists a private right of action to enforce this statutory provision, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] it is apparent that the language of \xc2\xa7 2 no more than elaborates upon that of the Fifteenth Amendment, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and the sparse legislative history </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 446 U. S. 61</a></p><p> of \xc2\xa7 2 makes clear that it was intended to have an effect no different from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself.</p>\n<p>Section 2 was an uncontroversial provision in proposed legislation whose other provisions engendered protracted dispute.  The House Report on the bill simply recited that \xc2\xa7 2</p>\n<p>"grants . . . a right to be free from enactment or enforcement of voting qualifications . . . or practices which deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 23 (1965).  <em>See also</em> S.Rep. No. 162, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 19-20 (1965).  The view that this section simply restated the prohibitions already contained in the Fifteenth Amendment was expressed without contradiction during the Senate hearings.  Senator Dirksen indicated at one point that all States, whether or not covered by the preclearance provisions of \xc2\xa7 5 of the proposed legislation, were prohibited from discriminating against Negro voters by \xc2\xa7 2, which he termed "almost a rephrasing of the 15th [A]mendment."  Attorney General Katzenbach agreed.  <em>See</em> Voting Rights:  Hearings on S. 1564 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 208 (1965).</p>\n<p>In view of the section\'s language and its sparse but clear legislative history, it is evident that this statutory provision adds nothing to the appellees\' Fifteenth Amendment claim.  We turn, therefore, to a consideration of the validity of the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s early decisions under the Fifteenth Amendment established that it imposes but one limitation on the powers of the States.  It forbids them to discriminate against Negroes in matters having to do with voting.  <em>See Ex parte Yarbrough,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/651/case.html">110 U.

In <em>Guinn v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/238/347/case.html">238 U.

It was asserted by way of defense that the provision was immune from successful challenge, since a law could not be found unconstitutional either "by attributing to the legislative authority an occult motive" or</p>\n<p>"because of conclusions concerning its operation in practical execution and resulting discrimination arising . . . from inequalities naturally inhering in those who must come within the standard in order to enjoy the right to vote."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/238/347/case.html#359">238 U.

The cases of <em>Smith v. Allwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/649/case.html">321 U. S. 649</a></span>, and <em>Terry v.

S. 64</a></p><p> example, dealt with the question whether a State was so involved with racially discriminatory voting practices as to invoke the Amendment\'s protection.  Although their facts differed somewhat, the question in both cases was whether the State was sufficiently implicated in the conduct of racially exclusionary primary elections to make that discrimination an abridgment of the right to vote by a State.  Since the Texas Democratic Party primary in <em>Smith v. Allwright</em> was regulated by statute, and only party nominees chosen in a primary were placed on the ballot for the general election, the Court concluded that the state Democratic Party had become the agency of the State, and that the State thereby had "endorse[d], adopt[ed] and enforce[d] the discrimination against Negroes, practiced by a party."  321 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/657/case.html#664">446 U. S. 664</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Terry v. Adams, supra,</em> posed a more difficult question of state involvement.  The primary election challenged in that case was conducted by a county political organization, the Jaybird Association, that was neither authorized nor regulated under state law.  The candidates chosen in the Jaybird primary, however, invariably won in the subsequent Democratic primary and in the general election, and the Court found that the Fifteenth Amendment had been violated.  Although the several supporting opinions differed in their formulation of this conclusion, there was agreement that the State was involved in the purposeful exclusion of Negroes from participation in the election process.</p>\n<p>The appellees have argued in this Court that <em>Smith v. Allwright</em> and <em>Terry v. Adams</em> support the conclusion that the at-large system of elections in Mobile is unconstitutional, reasoning that the effect of racially polarized voting in Mobile is the same as that of a racially exclusionary primary.  The only characteristic, however, of the exclusionary primaries that offended the Fifteenth Amendment was that Negroes were not permitted to vote in them.  The difficult question was whether the "State ha[d] had a hand in" the patent discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 446 U. S. 65</a></p><p> practiced by a nominally private organization. <em>Terry v. Adams, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/461/case.html#473">345 U. S. 473</a></span> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).</p>\n<p>The answer to the appellees\' argument is that, as the District Court expressly found, their freedom to vote has not been denied or abridged by anyone.  The Fifteenth Amendment does not entail the right to have Negro candidates elected, and neither <em>Smith v. Allwright</em> nor <em>Terry v. Adams</em> contains any implication to the contrary.  That Amendment prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to vote "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."  Having found that Negroes in Mobile "register and vote without hindrance," the District Court and Court of Appeals were in error in believing that the appellants invaded the protection of that Amendment in the present case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also agreed with the District Court that Mobile\'s at-large electoral system violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  There remains for consideration, therefore, the validity of its judgment on that score.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The claim that at-large electoral schemes unconstitutionally deny to some persons the equal protection of the laws has been advanced in numerous cases before this Court.  That contention has been raised most often with regard to multimember constituencies within a state legislative apportionment system.  The constitutional objection to multimember districts is not and cannot be that, as such, they depart from apportionment on a population basis in violation of <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span>, and its progeny.  Rather, the focus in such cases has been on the lack of representation multimember districts afford various elements of the voting population in a system of representative legislative democracy.</p>\n<p>"Criticism [of multimember districts] is rooted in their winner- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 446 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We have recognized, however, that such legislative apportionments could violate the Fourteenth Amendment if their purpose were invidiously to minimize or cancel out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities.  <em>See White v. Regester, supra; Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra; Burns v. Richardson, supra; Fortson v. Dorsey, supra.</em>  To prove such a purpose, it is not enough to show that the group allegedly discriminated against has not elected representatives in proportion to its numbers.  <em>White v.

S. 149</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This burden of proof is simply one aspect of the basic principle that only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>See Washington v.

The Court explicitly indicated in <em>Washington v. Davis</em> that this principle applies to claims of racial discrimination affecting voting just as it does to other claims of racial discrimination.  Indeed, the Court\'s opinion in that case viewed <em>Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/52/case.html">376 U.

The challenged districts were made up predominantly of whites or of minority races, and their boundaries were irregularly drawn.  The challengers did not prevail, because they failed to prove that the New York Legislature \'was either motivated by racial considerations or in fact drew the districts on racial lines;\' the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute \'was the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.\'  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/376/52/case.html#56">376 U.

More recently, in <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra,</em> the Court again relied on <em>Wright v. Rockefeller</em> to illustrate the principle that "[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause."  429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html#265">429 U.

Although dicta may be drawn from a few of the Court\'s earlier opinions suggesting that disproportionate effects alone may establish a claim of unconstitutional racial vote dilution, the fact is that such a view is not supported by any decision of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 446 U. S. 68</a></p><p> this Court. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  More importantly, such a view is not consistent with the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause as it has been understood in a variety of other contexts involving alleged racial discrimination.  <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> (employment); <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra,</em> (zoning); <em>Keyes v.

That case was <em>White v. Regester.</em>  There the Court upheld a constitutional challenge by Negroes and Mexican-Americans to parts of a legislative reapportionment plan adopted by the State of Texas.  The plaintiffs alleged that the multimember districts for the two counties in which they resided minimized the effect of their votes in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court held that the plaintiffs had been able to</p>\n<p>"produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 446 U.

In so holding, the Court relied upon evidence in the record that included a long history of official discrimination against minorities as well as indifference to their needs and interests on the part of white elected officials.  The Court also found in each county additional factors that restricted the access of minority groups to the political process.  In one county, Negroes effectively were excluded from the process of slating candidates for the Democratic Party, while the plaintiffs in the other county were Mexican-Americans who "suffer[ed] a cultural and language barrier" that made "participation in community processes extremely difficult, particularly . . . with respect to the political life" of the county.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#768">412 U.

The Court stated the constitutional question in <em>White</em> to be whether the "multimember districts [were] <em>being used invidiously</em> to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial groups," 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html#785">412 U.

S. 70</a></p><p> Moreover, much of the evidence on which the Court relied in that case was relevant only for the reason that "official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact."  <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html#264">429 U. S. 264</a></span>-265.  Of course, "[t]he impact of the official action -- whether it <em>bears more heavily on one race than another,\' <em>Washington v. Davis, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#242">426 U.

But where the character of a law is readily explainable on grounds apart from race, as would nearly always be true where, as here, an entire system of local governance is brought into question, disproportionate impact alone cannot be decisive, and courts must look to other evidence to support a finding of discriminatory purpose.  <em>See ibid.; Washington v. Davis, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#242">426 U. S. 242</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>We may assume, for present purposes, that an at-large election of city officials with all the legislative, executive, and administrative power of the municipal government is constitutionally indistinguishable from the election of a few members of a state legislative body in multimember districts -- although this may be a rash assumption. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  But even making this assumption, it is clear that the evidence in the present case fell far short of showing that the appellants "conceived or operated [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination."  <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/124/case.html#149">403 U. S. 149</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 446 U. S. 71</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court assessed the appellees\' claims in light of the standard that had been articulated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Zimmer v.McKeithen,</em> 485 F.2d 1297.  That case, coming before <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a></span>, was quite evidently decided upon the misunderstanding that it is not necessary to show a discriminatory purpose in order to prove a violation of the Equal Protection Clause -- that proof of a discriminatory effect is sufficient.  <em>See</em> 485 F.2d at 1304-1305, and n. 16. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of the criteria identified in <em>Zimmer,</em> the District Court based its conclusion of unconstitutionality primarily on the fact that no Negro had ever been elected to the City Commission, apparently because of the pervasiveness of racially polarized voting in Mobile.  The trial court also found that city officials had not been as responsive to the interests of Negroes as to those of white persons.  On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the political processes in Mobile were not equally open to Negroes, despite its seemingly inconsistent findings that there were no inhibitions against Negroes\' becoming candidates, and that, in fact, Negroes had registered and voted without hindrance.  423 F.Supp. at 387.  Finally, with little additional discussion, the District Court held that Mobile\'s at-large electoral system was invidiously discriminating against Negroes in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="72">Page 446 U. S. 72</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In affirming the District Court, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment reaches only purposeful discrimination, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] but held that one way a plaintiff may establish this illicit purpose is by adducing evidence that satisfies the criteria of its decision in <em>Zimmer v. McKeithen, supra.</em>  Thus, because the appellees had proved an "aggregate" of the <em>Zimmer</em> factors, the Court of Appeals concluded that a discriminatory purpose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 446 U. S. 73</a></p><p> had been proved.  That approach, however, is inconsistent with out decisions in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> and <em>Arlington Heights, supra.</em>  Although the presence of the indicia relied on in <em>Zimmer</em> may afford some criteria is not, of itself, sufficient proof of such a purpose.  The so-called <em>Zimmer</em> criteria upon which the District Court and the Court of Appeals relied were most assuredly insufficient to prove an unconstitutionally discriminatory purpose in the present case.</p>\n<p>First, the two courts found it highly significant that no Negro had been elected to the Mobile City Commission.  From this fact, they concluded that the processes leading to nomination and election were not open equally to Negroes.  But the District Court\'s findings of fact, unquestioned on appeal, make clear that Negroes register and vote in Mobile "without hindrance," and that there are no official obstacles in the way of Negroes who wish to become candidates for election to the Commission.  Indeed, it was undisputed that the only active "slating" organization in the city is comprised of Negroes.  It may be that Negro candidates have been defeated, but that fact alone does not work a constitutional deprivation.  <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis,</em> 403 U.S. at 160; <em>see Arlington Heights,</em> 429 U.S. at 266, n. 15. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, the District Court relied in part on its finding that the persons who were elected to the Commission discriminated against Negroes in municipal employment and in dispensing public services.  If that is the case, those discriminated against may be entitled to relief under the Constitution, albeit of a sort quite different from that sought in the present case.  The Equal Protection Clause proscribes purposeful discrimination because of race by any unit of state government, whatever </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 446 U. S. 74</a></p><p> the method of its election.  But evidence of discrimination by white officials in Mobile is relevant only as the most tenuous and circumstantial evidence of the constitutional invalidity of the electoral system under which they attained their offices. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, the District Court and the Court of Appeals supported their conclusion by drawing upon the substantial history of official racial discrimination in Alabama.  But past discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.  The ultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case.  More distant instances of official discrimination in other cases are of limited help in resolving that question.</p>\n<p>Finally, the District Court and the Court of Appeals pointed to the mechanics of the at-large electoral system itself as proof that the votes of Negroes were being invidiously canceled out.  But those features of that electoral system, such as the majority vote requirement, tend naturally to disadvantage any voting minority, as we noted in <em>White v. Regester,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html">412 U. S. 755</a></span>.  They are far from proof that the at-large electoral scheme represents purposeful discrimination against Negro voters.

S. </a></span> JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s dissenting opinion.  The theory of this dissenting opinion -- a theory much more extreme than that espoused by the District Court or the Court of Appeal, appears to be that every "political group," or at least every such group that is in the minority, has a federal constitutional right to elect candidates in proportion to its numbers. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Moreover, a political group\'s "right" to have its candidates elected is said to be a "fundamental interest," the infringement of which may be established without proof that a State has acted with the purpose of impairing anybody\'s access to the political process.  This dissenting opinion finds the "right" infringed in the present case because no Negro has been elected to the Mobile City Commission.</p>\n<p>Whatever appeal the dissenting opinion\'s view may have as a matter of political theory, it is not the law.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 446 U. S. 76</a></p><p> require proportional representation as an imperative of political organization.  The entitlement that the dissenting opinion assumes to exist simply is not to be found in the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>It is of course true that a law that impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly secured by the Constitution is presumptively unconstitutional.  <em>See Shapiro v.

But this right to equal participation in the electoral process does not protect any "political group," however defined, from electoral defeat. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion erroneously discovers the asserted entitlement to group representation within the "one person, one vote" principle of <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra,</em> and its progeny. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Those cases established that the Equal Protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 446 U.

The Court recognized that a voter\'s right to "have an equally effective voice" in the election of representatives is impaired where representation is not apportioned substantially on a population basis.  In such cases, the votes of persons in more populous districts carry less weight than do those of persons in smaller districts.  There can be, of course, no claim that the "one person, one vote" principle has been violated in this case, because the city of Mobile is a unitary electoral district and the Commission elections are conducted at large.  It is therefore obvious that nobody\'s vote has been "diluted" in the sense in which that word was used in the <em>Reynolds</em> case.</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion places an extraordinary interpretation on these decisions, an interpretation not justified by <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em> itself or by any other decision of this Court.  It is, of course, true that the right of a person to vote on an equal basis with other voters draws much of its significance from the political associations that its exercise reflects, but it is an altogether different matter to conclude that political groups themselves have an independent constitutional claim to representation. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  And the Court\'s decisions hold squarely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 446 U.

In <em>Whitcomb v.

Reversing the trial court, this Court said:</p>\n<p>"The District Court\'s holding, although, on the facts of this case, limited to guaranteeing one racial group representation, is not easily contained.  It is expressive of the more general proposition that any group with distinctive interests must be represented in legislative halls if it is numerous enough to command at least one seat and represents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 446 U.

This approach would make it difficult to reject claims of Democrats, Republicans, or members of any political organization in Marion County who live in what would be safe districts in a single-member district system, but who, in one year or another, or year after year, are submerged in a one-sided multi-member district vote.  There are also union-oriented workers, the university community, religious or ethnic groups occupying identifiable areas of our heterogeneous cities and urban areas.  Indeed, it would be difficult for a great many, if not most, multi-member districts to survive analysis under the District Court\'s view unless combined with some voting arrangement such as proportional representation or cumulative voting aimed at providing representation for minority parties or interests.

Thus, the fact that there is a constitutional right to a system of jury selection that is not purposefully exclusionary does not entail a right to a jury of any particular racial composition.

Indeed, certain preliminary practical questions immediately come to mind:  can only members of a minority of the voting population in a particular municipality be members of a "political group"?  How large must a "group" be to be a "political group"?  Can any "group" call itself a "political group"?  If not, who is to say which "groups" are "political groups"?  Can a qualified voter belong to more than one "political group"?  Can there be more than one "political group" among white voters (<em>e.g.,</em> Irish-American, Italian-American, Polish-American, Jews, Catholics, Protestants)?  Can there be more than one "political group" among nonwhite voters? Do the answers to any of these questions depend upon the particular demographic composition of a given city?  Upon the total size of its voting population?  Upon the size of its governing body?  Upon its form of government?  Upon its history?  Its geographic location?  The fact that even these preliminary questions may be largely unanswerable suggests some of the conceptual and practical fallacies in the constitutional theory espoused by the dissenting opinion, putting to one side the total absence of support for that theory in the Constitution itself.</p>\n<p>MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>Assuming that proof of intent is a prerequisite to appellees\' prevailing on their constitutional claim of vote dilution, I am inclined to agree with MR.

S. 81</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It seems to me that the city of Mobile, and its citizenry, have a substantial interest in maintaining the commission form of government that has been in effect there for nearly 70 years.  The District Court recognized that its remedial order, changing the form of the city\'s government to a mayor-council system, "raised serious constitutional issues."  423 F.Supp. 384, 404 (SD Ala.1976).  Nonetheless, the court was "unable to see how the impermissibly unconstitutional dilution can be effectively corrected by any other approach."  <em>Id.</em> at 403.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals approved the remedial measures adopted by the District Court, and did so essentially on three factors:  (1) this Court\'s preference for single-member districting in court-ordered legislative reapportionment, absent special circumstances, <em>see, e.g., Connor v. Finch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/407/case.html">431 U. S. 407</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/407/case.html#415">431 U. S. 415</a></span> (1977); (2) appellants\' noncooperation with the District Court\'s request for the submission of proposed municipal government plans that called for single-member districts for councilmen, under a mayor-council system of government; and (3) the temporary nature of the relief afforded by the District Court, the city or State being free to adopt a "constitutional replacement" for the District Court\'s plan in the future.  571 F.2d 238, 247 (CA5 1978).</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court of Appeals, I believe that special circumstances are presented when a District Court "reapportions" a municipal government by altering its basic structures.  <em>See also</em> the opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#70">446 U. S. 70</a></span>, and n. 15.  <em>See Chapman v. Meier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/1/case.html">420 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/1/case.html#20">420 U.

I also believe that the city\'s failure to submit a proposed plan to the District Court was excused by the fact that the only proposals the court was interested in receiving were variations on a mayor-council plan utilizing single-member districts.  Finally, although the District Court\'s order may have been temporary, it was unlikely that the courts below would have approved any attempt by Mobile to return to the commission form of government.  And even </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 446 U. S. 82</a></p><p> a temporary alteration of a long-established form of municipal government is a drastic measure for a court to take.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the District Court, I do not believe that, in order to remedy the unconstitutional vote dilution it found, it was necessary to convert Mobile\'s city government to a mayor-council system.  In my view, the District Court at least should have considered alternative remedial orders that would have maintained some of the basic elements of the commission system Mobile long ago had selected -- joint exercise of legislative and executive power, and city-wide representation.  In the first place, I see no reason for the court to have separated legislative and executive power in the city of Mobile by creating the office of mayor.  In the second place, the court could have, and in my view should have, considered expanding the size of the Mobile City Commission and providing for the election of at least some commissioners at large.  Alternative plans might have retained at-large elections for all commissioners while imposing district residency requirements that would have insured the election of a commission that was a cross-section of all of Mobile\'s neighborhoods, or a plurality-win system that would have provided the potential for the effective use of single-shot voting by black voters.  <em>See City of Rome v. United States, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/case.html#184">446 U. S. 184</a></span>, n.19.  In failing to consider such alternative plans, it appears to me that the District Court was perhaps overly concerned with the elimination of at-large elections <em>per se,</em> rather than with structuring an electoral system that provided an opportunity for black voters in Mobile to participate in the city\'s government on an equal footing with whites.</p>\n<p>In the past, this Court has emphasized that a district court\'s remedial power "may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation," and that "the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy."  <em>Swann v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/case.html">402 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/1/case.html#16">402 U. S. 16</a></span> (1971).  I am not convinced that any violation of federal constitutional rights established by appellees required the District Court to dismantle Mobile\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 446 U. S. 83</a></p><p> commission form of government and replace it with a mayor-council system.  Accordingly, I too would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for reconsideration of an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>At issue in this case is the constitutionality of the city of Mobile\'s commission form of government.  Black citizens in Mobile, who constitute a minority of that city\'s registered voters, challenged the at-large nature of the elections for the three positions of City Commissioner, contending that the system "dilutes" their votes in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  While I agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART that no violation of respondents\' constitutional rights has been demonstrated, my analysis of the issue proceeds along somewhat different lines.</p>\n<p>In my view, there is a fundamental distinction between state action that inhibits an individual\'s right to vote and state action that affects the political strength of various groups that compete for leadership in a democratically governed community.  That distinction divides so-called vote dilution practices into two different categories "governed by entirely different constitutional considerations," <em>see Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/52/case.html">376 U. S. 52</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/52/case.html#58">376 U. S. 58</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In the first category are practices such as poll taxes or literacy tests that deny individuals access to the ballot.  Districting practices that make an individual\'s vote in a heavily populated district less significant than an individual\'s vote in a smaller district also belong in that category.  <em>See Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">Reynolds v.

S. 84</a></p><p> practices must be tested by the strictest of constitutional standards, whether challenged under the Fifteenth Amendment or under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html">405 U. S. 330</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html#337">405 U. S. 337</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This case does not fit within the first category.  The District Court found that black citizens in Mobile "register and vote without hindrance," [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and there is no claim that any individual\'s vote is worth less than any other\'s.  Rather, this case draws into question a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, but adversely affects the political strength of a racially identifiable group.  Although I am satisfied that such a structure may be challenged under the Fifteenth Amendment as well as under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] I believe that, under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 446 U. S. 85</a></p><p> either provision, it must be judged by a standard that allows the political process to function effectively.</p>\n<p>My conclusion that the Fifteenth Amendment applies to a case such as this rests on this Court\'s opinion in <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html">364 U. S. 339</a></span>.  That case established that the Fifteenth Amendment does not simply guarantee the individual\'s right to vote; it also limits the States\' power to draw political boundaries.  Although <em>Gomillion</em> involved a districting structure that completely excluded the members of one race from participation in the city\'s elections, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] it does not stand for the proposition that no racial group can prevail on a Fifteenth Amendment claim unless it proves that an electoral system has the effect of making its members\' right to vote, in MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s words, "nothing more than the right to cast meaningless ballots."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#104">446 U. S. 104</a></span>.  I agree with MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL that the Fifteenth Amendment need not and should not be so narrowly construed.  I do not agree, however, with his view that every "showing of discriminatory impact" on a historically and socially disadvantaged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 446 U. S. 86</a></p><p> racial group, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#104">446 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Neither <em>Gomillion</em> nor any other case decided by this Court establishes a constitutional right to proportional representation for racial minorities. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  What <em>Gomillion</em> holds is that a sufficiently "uncouth" or irrational racial gerrymander violates the Fifteenth Amendment.  As Mr. Justice Whittaker\'s concurrence in that case demonstrates, the same result is compelled by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>See</em> 364 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html#349">364 U. S. 349</a></span>.  The fact that the "gerrymander" condemned in <em>Gomillion</em> was equally vulnerable under both Amendments indicates that the essential holding of that case is applicable, not merely to gerrymanders directed against racial minorities, but to those aimed at religious, ethnic, economic, and political groups as well.  Whatever the proper standard for identifying an unconstitutional gerrymander may be, I have long been persuaded that it must apply equally to all forms of political gerrymandering -- not just to racial gerrymandering.  <em>See Cousins v. City Council</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 446 U. S. 87</a></p><p> <em>of Chicago,</em> 466 F.2d 830, 848-852 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied,</em> 409 U.S. 893. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>This conclusion follows, I believe, from the very nature of a gerrymander.  By definition, gerrymandering involves drawing district boundaries (or using multimember districts or at-large elections) in order to maximize the voting strength of those loyal to the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of those opposed to it. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  466 F.2d at 847.  In seeking the desired result, legislators necessarily make judgments about the probability that the members of certain identifiable groups, whether racial, ethnic, economic, or religious, will vote in the same way.  The success of the gerrymander from the legislators\' point of view, as well as its impact on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 446 U. S. 88</a></p><p> disadvantaged group, depends on the accuracy of those predictions.</p>\n<p>A prediction based on a racial characteristic is not necessarily more reliable than a prediction based on some other group characteristic.  Nor, since a legislator\'s ultimate purpose in making the prediction is political in character, is it necessarily more invidious or benign than a prediction based on other group characteristics. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  In the line-drawing process, racial, religious, ethnic, and economic gerrymanders are all species of political gerrymanders.</p>\n<p>From the standpoint of the groups of voters that are affected by the line-drawing process, it is also important to recognize that it is the group\'s interest in gaining or maintaining political power that is at stake.  The mere fact that a number of citizens share a common ethnic, racial, or religious background does not create the need for protection against gerrymandering.  It is only when their common interests are strong enough to be manifested in political action that the need arises.  For the political strength of a group is not a function of its ethnic, racial, or religious composition; rather, it is a function of numbers -- specifically the number of persons who will vote in the same way.  In the long run, there is no more certainty that individual members of racial groups will vote alike than that members of other identifiable groups will do so.  And surely there is no national interest in creating an incentive to define political groups by racial characteristics. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 446 U. S. 89</a></p><p> But if the Constitution were interpreted to give more favorable treatment to a racial minority alleging an unconstitutional impairment of its political strength than it gives to other identifiable groups making the same claim, such an incentive would inevitably result.</p>\n<p>My conclusion that the same standard should be applied to racial groups as is applied to other groups leads me also to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 446 U.

Marshall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/636/case.html">424 U.

Today, the plurality rejects the <em>Zimmer</em> analysis, holding that the primary, if not the sole, focus of the inquiry must be on the intent of the political body responsible for making the districting decision.  While I agree that the <em>Zimmer</em> analysis should be rejected, I do not believe that it is appropriate to focus on the subjective intent of the decisionmakers.</p>\n<p>In my view, the proper standard is suggested by three characteristics of the gerrymander condemned in <em>Gomillion:</em>  (1) the 28-sided configuration was, in the Court\'s word, "uncouth," that is to say, it was manifestly not the product of a routine or a traditional political decision; (2) it had a significant adverse impact on a minority group; and (3) it was unsupported by any neutral justification, and thus was either totally irrational or entirely motivated by a desire to curtail the political strength of the minority.  These characteristics suggest that a proper test should focus on the objective effects of the political decision, rather than the subjective motivation of the decisionmaker.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html">United States v.

[<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  In this case, if the commission form of government in Mobile were extraordinary, or if it were nothing more than a vestige of history, with no greater justification than the grotesque figure in <em>Gomillion,</em> it would surely violate the Constitution.  That conclusion would follow simply from its adverse impact on black voters, plus the absence of any legitimate justification for the system, without reference to the subjective intent of the political body that has refused to alter it.</p>\n<p>Conversely, I am also persuaded that a political decision that affects group voting rights may be valid even if it can be proved that irrational or invidious factors have played some part in its enactment or retention. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The standard for testing the acceptability of such a decision must take into account the fact that the responsibility for drawing political boundaries is generally committed to the legislative process, and that the process inevitably involves a series of compromises among different group interests.  If the process is to work, it must reflect an awareness of group interests and it must tolerate some attempts to advantage or to disadvantage particular segments of the voting populace.  Indeed, the same "group interest" may simultaneously support and oppose a particular boundary change. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  The standard cannot, therefore, be so </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 446 U. S. 92</a></p><p> strict that any evidence of a purpose to disadvantage a bloc of voters will justify a finding of "invidious discrimination"; otherwise, the facts of political life would deny legislatures the right to perform the districting function.  Accordingly, a political decision that is supported by valid and articulable justifications cannot be invalid simply because some participants in the decisionmaking process were motivated by a purpose to disadvantage a minority group.</p>\n<p>The decision to retain the commission form of government in Mobile, Ala., is such a decision.  I am persuaded that some support for its retention comes, directly or indirectly, from members of the white majority who are motivated by a desire to make it more difficult for members of the black minority to serve in positions of responsibility in city government.  I deplore that motivation, and wish that neither it nor any other irrational prejudice played any part in our political processes.  But I do not believe otherwise legitimate political choices can be invalidated simply because an irrational or invidious purpose played some part in the decisionmaking process.</p>\n<p>As MR. JUSTICE STEWART points out, Mobile\'s basic election system is the same as that followed by literally thousands of municipalities and other governmental units throughout the Nation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#60">446 U.

They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely.

That system, by whatever name it is called, is a divisive force in a community, emphasizing differences between candidates and voters that are irrelevant in the constitutional sense.

The probability of parallel voting fluctuates as the blend of political issues affecting the outcome of an election changes from time to time to emphasize one issue, or a few, rather than others, as dominant.  The facts that a political group has its own history, has suffered its own special injustices, and has its own congeries of special political interests, do not make one such group different from any other in the eyes of the law.

The District Court also referred to Texas\' majority vote requirement and "place" rule, "neither in themselves improper nor invidious," but which "enhanced the opportunity for racial discrimination" by reducing legislative elections from the multimember district to "a head-to-head contest for each position."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We deemed more fundamental the District Court\'s findings that only two Negro state representatives had been elected from Dallas County since Reconstruction, and that these were the only two Negroes ever slated by an organization that effectively controlled Democratic Party candidate slating.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#766">412 U. S. 766</a></span>-767.  We also noted the District Court\'s findings that the Democratic Party slating organization was insensitive to the needs and aspirations of the Negro community and that, at times, it had employed racial campaign tactics to defeat candidates supported by the black community.  Based on this evidence, the District Court concluded that the black community generally was "not permitted to enter into the political process in a reliable and meaningful manner."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#767">412 U.

We held that</p>\n<p>"[t]hese findings and conclusions are sufficient to sustain the District Court\'s judgment with respect to the Dallas multimember district and, on this record, we have no reason to disturb them."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>With respect to the exclusion of Mexican-Americans from the political process in Bexar County, the District Court referred to the continuing effects of a long history of invidious discrimination against Mexican-Americans in education, employment, economics, health, politics, and other fields.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#768">412 U. S. 768</a></span>.  The impact of this discrimination, coupled with a cultural and language barrier, made Mexican-American participation in the political life of Bexar County extremely difficult.  Only five Mexican-Americans had represented Bexar County in the Texas Legislature since 1880, and the county\'s legislative delegation "was insufficiently responsive to Mexican-American interests."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#769">412 U.

Regester</em> in assessing whether the maintenance of a system of at-large elections for the selection of Mobile City Commissioners denied Mobile Negroes their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights.  Scrupulously adhering to our admonition that</p>\n<p>"[t]he plaintiffs\' burden is to produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election were not equally open to participation by the group in question,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/67/case.html#76">412 U. S. 766</a></span>, the District Court conducted a detailed factual inquiry into the openness of the candidate selection process to black.  The court noted that "Mobile blacks were subjected to massive official and private racial discrimination until the Voting Rights Act of 1965," and that "[t]he pervasive effects of past discrimination still substantially affec[t] black political participation."  423 F.Supp. 384, 387 (SD Ala.1976).  Although the District Court noted that, "[s]ince the Voting Rights Act of 1965, blacks register and vote without hindrance," the court found that "local political processes are not equally open" to blacks.  Despite the fact that Negroes constitute more than 35% of the population of Mobile, no Negro has ever been elected to the Mobile </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 446 U. S. 98</a></p><p> City Commission.  The plaintiffs introduced extensive evidence of severe racial polarization in voting patterns during the 1960\'s and 1970\'s with "white voting for white and black for black if a white is opposed to a black," resulting in the defeat of the black candidate, or, if two whites are running, the defeat of the white candidate most identified with blacks.  <em>Id.</em> at 388.  Regression analyses covering every City Commission race in 1965, 1969, and 1973, both the primary and general election of the county commission in 1968 and 1972, selected school board races in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1974, city referendums in 1963 and 1973, and a countywide legislative race in 1969 confirmed the existence of severe bloc voting.  <em>Id.</em> at 388-389.  Nearly every active candidate for public office testified that, because of racial polarization "it is highly unlikely that anytime in the foreseeable future, under the at-large system, . . . a black can be elected against a white."  <em>Id.</em> at 388.  After single-member districts were created in Mobile County for state legislative elections, "three blacks of the present fourteen member Mobile County delegation have been elected."  <em>Id.</em> at 389.  Based on the foregoing evidence, the District Court found</p>\n<p>"that the structure of the at-large election of city commissioners, combined with strong racial polarization of Mobile\'s electorate, continues to effectively discourage qualified black citizens from seeking office or being elected, thereby denying blacks equal access to the slating or candidate selection process."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court also reviewed extensive evidence that the City Commissioners elected under the at-large system have not been responsive to the needs of the Negro community.  The court found that city officials have been unresponsive to the interests of Mobile Negroes in municipal employment, appointments to boards and committees, and the provision of municipal services in part because of "the political fear of a white backlash vote when black citizens\' needs are at stake."  <em>Id.</em> at 392.  The court also found that there is no clear-cut state policy preference for at-large elections, and that past discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 446 U. S. 99</a></p><p> affecting the ability of Negroes to register and to vote "has helped preclude the effective participation of blacks in the election system today."  <em>Id.</em> at 393.  The adverse impact of the at-large election system on minorities was found to be enhanced by the large size of the city-wide election district, the majority vote requirement, the provision that candidates run for positions by place or number, and the lack of any provision for at-large candidates to run from particular geographical subdistricts.</p>\n<p>After concluding its extensive findings of fact, the District Court addressed the question of the effect of <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a></span> (1976), on the <em>White v. Regester</em> standards.  The court concluded that the requirement that a facially neutral statute involve purposeful discrimination before a violation of the Equal Protection Clause can be established was not inconsistent with <em>White v. Regester</em> in light of the recognition in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#241">426 U. S. 241</a></span>-242, that the discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the discriminatory impact of the statute.  423 F.Supp. at 398.  After noting that,</p>\n<p>"whenever a redistricting bill of any type is proposed by a county delegation member, a major concern has centered around how many, if any, blacks would be elected,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 397, the District Court concluded that there was "a present purpose to dilute the black vote . . . resulting from intentional state legislative <em>inaction.</em> . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 398.  Based on an "exhaustive analysis of the evidence in the record," the court held that "[t]he plaintiffs have met the burden cast in <em>White</em> and <em>Whitcomb,</em>" and that "the multi-member at-large election of Mobile City Commissioners . . . results in an unconstitutional dilution of black voting strength."  <em>Id.</em> at 402.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s judgment in one of four consolidated "dilution" cases decided on the same day.  <em>Bolden v. Mobile,</em> 571 F.2d 238 (CA5 1978); <em>Nevett v. Sides,</em> 571 F.2d 209 (CA5 1978) (<em>Nevett II</em>); <em>Blacks United for lasting leadership, Inc. v. Shreveport,</em> 571 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 446 U. S. 100</a></p><p> F.2d 248 (CA5 1978); <em>Thomasville Branch of NAACP v. Thomas County, Georgia,</em> 571 F.2d 257 (CA5 1978).  In the lead case of <em>Nevett II, supra,</em> the Court of Appeals held that, under <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> and <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html">429 U. S. 252</a></span> (1977), "a showing of racially motivated discrimination is a necessary element" for a successful claim of unconstitutional voting dilution under either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.  571 F.2d at 219.  The court concluded that the standards for proving unconstitutional voting dilution outlined in <em>White v. Regester</em> were consistent with the requirement that purposeful discrimination be shown because they focus on factors that go beyond a simple showing that minorities are not represented in proportion to their numbers in the general population.  571 F.2d at 219-220, n. 13, 222-224.</p>\n<p>In its decision in the instant case, the Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court\'s findings of fact, found them not to be clearly erroneous, and held that they</p>\n<p>"compel the inference that [Mobile\'s at-large] system has been maintained with the purpose of diluting the black vote, thus supplying the element of intent necessary to establish a violation of the fourteenth amendment, <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/429/252/case.html">429 U. S. 252</a></span> (1977); <em>Washington v.

The court observed that the District Court\'s "finding that the legislature was acutely conscious of the racial consequences of its districting policies," coupled with the attempt to assign different functions to each of the three City Commissioners "to lock in the at-large feature of the scheme," constituted "direct evidence of the intent behind the maintenance of the at-large plan." <em>Id.</em> at 246.  The Court of Appeals concluded that</p>\n<p>"the district court has properly conducted the \'sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available\' that a court must undertake in \'[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 446 U. S. 101</a></p><p> purpose was a motivating factor\' in the maintenance or enactment of a districting plan."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.,</em> quoting <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html#266">429 U. S. 266</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>A plurality of the Court today agrees with the courts below that maintenance of Mobile\'s at-large system for election of City Commissioners violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments only if it is motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.  The plurality also apparently reaffirms the vitality of <em>White v. Regester</em> and <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis,</em> which established the standards for determining whether at-large election systems are unconstitutionally discriminatory.  The plurality nonetheless casts aside the meticulous application of the principles of these cases by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals by concluding that the evidence they relied upon "fell far short of showing" purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p>The plurality erroneously suggests that the District Court erred by considering the factors articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Zimmer v. McKeithen,</em> 485 F.2d 1297 (CA5 1973), to determine whether purposeful discrimination has been shown.  This remarkable suggestion ignores the facts that <em>Zimmer</em> articulated the very factors deemed relevant by <em>White v. Regester</em> and <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis</em> -- a lack of minority access to the candidate selection process, unresponsiveness of elected officials to minority interests, a history of discrimination, majority vote requirements, provisions that candidates run for positions by place or number, the lack of any provision for at-large candidates to run from particular geographical subdistricts -- and that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered these factors with the recognition that they are relevant only with respect to the question whether purposeful discrimination can be inferred.</p>\n<p>Although the plurality does acknowledge that "the presence of the indicia relied on in <em>Zimmer</em> may afford some evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 446 U. S. 102</a></p><p> of a discriminatory purpose," it concludes that the evidence relied upon by the court below was "most assuredly insufficient to prove an unconstitutionally discriminatory purpose in the present case."  The plurality apparently bases this conclusion on the fact that there are no official obstacles barring Negroes from registering, voting, and running for office, coupled with its conclusion that none of the factors relied upon by the courts below would, alone, be sufficient to support an inference of purposeful discrimination.  The absence of official obstacles to registration, voting, and running for office heretofore has never been deemed to insulate an electoral system from attack under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  In <em>White v. Regester,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html">412 U. S. 755</a></span> (1973), there was no evidence that Negroes faced official obstacles to registration, voting, and running for office, yet we upheld a finding that they had been excluded from effective participation in the political process in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because a multimember districting scheme, in the context of racial voting at the polls, was being used invidiously to prevent Negroes from being elected to public office.  In <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html">364 U. S. 339</a></span> (1960), and <em>Terry v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/461/case.html">345 U. S. 461</a></span> (1953), we invalidated electoral systems under the Fifteenth Amendment not because they erected official obstacles in the path of Negroes registering, voting, or running for office, but because they were used effectively to deprive the Negro vote of any value.  Thus, even though Mobile\'s Negro community may register and vote without hindrance, the system of at-large election of City Commissioners may violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments if it is used purposefully to exclude Negroes from the political process.</p>\n<p>In conducting "an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact" of the at-large election scheme, <em>White v. Regester, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#769">412 U. S. 769</a></span>, the District Court\'s decision was fully consistent with our recognition in <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#242">426 U. S. 242</a></span>, that</p>\n<p>"an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 446 U. S. 103</a></p><p> including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another."</p>\n<p>Although the totality of the facts relied upon by the District Court to support is inference of purposeful discrimination is even more compelling than that present in <em>White v. Regester,</em> the plurality today rejects the inference of purposeful discrimination, apparently because each of the factors relied upon by the courts below is, alone, insufficient to support the inference.  The plurality states that the "fact [that Negro candidates have been defeated], alone, does not work a constitutional deprivation," that evidence of the unresponsiveness of elected officials "is relevant only as the most tenuous and circumstantial evidence," that "the substantial history of official racial discrimination . . [is] of limited help," and that the features of the electoral system that enhance the disadvantages faced by a voting minority "are far from proof that the at-large electoral scheme represents purposeful discrimination."  By viewing each of the factors relied upon below in isolation, and ignoring the fact that racial bloc voting at the polls makes it impossible to elect a black commissioner under the at-large system, the plurality rejects the "totality of the circumstances" approach we endorsed in <em>White v. Regester, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#766">412 U. S. 766</a></span>-770, <em>Washington v. Davis, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#241">426 U. S. 241</a></span>-242, and <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.

S. 266</a></span>, and leaves the courts below adrift on uncharted seas with respect to how to proceed on remand.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that the findings of the District Court amply support an inference of purposeful discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.<l=>*</l=></p>\n<p>The American ideal of political equality, conceived in the earliest days of our colonial existence and fostered by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 446 U. S. 104</a></p><p> egalitarian language of the Declaration of Independence, could not forever tolerate the limitation of the right to vote to white propertied males.  Our Constitution has been amended six times in the movement toward a democracy for more than the few, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] and this Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to provide that "a citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction," <em>Dunn v. Blumstein,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html">405 U. S. 330</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/case.html#336">405 U. S. 336</a></span> (1972).  The Court\'s decision today is in a different spirit.  Indeed, a plurality of the Court concludes that, in the absence of proof of intentional discrimination by the State, the right to vote provides the politically powerless with nothing more than the right to cast meaningless ballots.  The District Court in both of these cases found that the challenged multimember districting schemes unconstitutionally diluted the Negro vote.  These factual findings were upheld by the Court of Appeals, and the plurality does not question them.  Instead, the plurality concludes that districting schemes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is proved that they were enacted or maintained for the purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of a racial minority.  The plurality would require plaintiffs in vote-dilution cases to meet the stringent burden of establishing discriminatory intent within the meaning of <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a></span> (1976); <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html">429 U. S. 252</a></span> (1977); and <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/case.html">442 U. S. 256</a></span> (1979).  In my view, our vote dilution decisions require only a showing of discriminatory impact to justify the invalidation of a multimember districting scheme, and, because they are premised on the fundamental interest in voting protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, the discriminatory impact standard adopted by them is unaffected by <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> and its progeny.  Furthermore, an intent requirement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 446 U. S. 105</a></p><p> is inconsistent with the protection against denial or abridgment of the vote on account of race embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment and in \xc2\xa7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Even if, however, proof of discriminatory intent were necessary to support a vote-dilution claim, I would impose upon the plaintiffs a standard of proof less rigid than that provided by <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, supra.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court does not dispute the proposition that multimember districting can have the effect of submerging electoral minorities and over-representing electoral majorities. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  It is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 446 U. S. 106</a></p><p> for this reason that we developed a strong preference for single-member districting in court-ordered reapportionment plans.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#66">446 U. S. 66</a></span>, n. 12.  Furthermore, and more important for present purposes, we decided a series of vote-dilution cases under the Fourteenth Amendment that were designed to protect electoral minorities from precisely the combination of electoral laws and historical and social factors found in the present cases. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  In my view, the plurality\'s treatment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 446 U. S. 107</a></p><p> these cases is fanciful.  Although we have held that multimember districts are not unconstitutional <em>per se, see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#66">446 U. S. 66</a></span>, there is simply no basis for the plurality\'s conclusion that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 446 U. S. 108</a></p><p> under our prior cases, proof of discriminatory intent is a necessary condition for the invalidation of multimember districting.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Fortson v.

We then held that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof:</p>\n<p>"[T]he demonstration that a particular multi-member scheme <em>effects an invidious result</em> must appear from evidence in the record. . . .  That demonstration was not made here.  In relying on conjecture as to the effects of multi-member districting, rather than demonstrated fact, the court acted in a manner more appropriate to the body responsible for drawing up the districting plan.

Sims</em> and its progeny [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>] focused solely on the discriminatory effects of malapportionment.  They recognize that, when population figures for the representational districts of a legislature are not similar, the votes of citizens in larger districts do not carry as much weight in the legislature as do votes cast by citizens in smaller districts.  The equal protection problem attacked by the "one person, one vote" principle is, then, one of vote dilution:  under <em>Reynolds,</em> each citizen must have an "equally effective voice" in the election of representatives.  <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 565</span>.  In the present cases, the alleged vote dilution, though caused by the combined effects of the electoral structure and social and historical factors, rather than by unequal population distribution, is analytically the same concept:  the unjustified abridgment of a fundamental right. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  It follows, then, that a showing of discriminatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 446 U. S. 117</a></p><p> intent is just as unnecessary under the vote-dilution approach adopted in <em>Fortson v. Dorsey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/433/case.html">379 U.

S. 118</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Indeed, our vote-dilution cases have explicitly acknowledged that they are premised on the infringement of a fundamental right, not on the Equal Protection Clause\'s prohibition of racial discrimination.  Our first vote-dilution decision, <em>Fortson v. Dorsey, supra,</em> involved a 1962 Georgia reapportionment statute that allocated the 54 seats of the Georgia Senate among the State\'s 159 counties.  Thirty-three of the senatorial districts were made up of from one to eight counties each, and were single-member districts.  The remaining 21 districts were allotted among the 7 most populous counties, with each county containing at least 2 districts and electing all of its senators by county-wide vote.  The plaintiffs, who were registered voters residing in two of the multidistrict counties, [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>] argued that the apportionment plan, on its face, violated the Equal Protection Clause because county-wide voting in the seven multidistrict counties denied their residents a vote equal to that of voters residing in single-member constituencies. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 446 U. S. 119</a></p><p> We were unconvinced that the plan operated to dilute any Georgian\'s vote, and therefore upheld the facial validity of the scheme.  We cautioned, however, that the Equal Protection Clause would not tolerate a multimember districting plan that, "designedly or otherwise, . . operate[d] to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population."  379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/433/case.html#439">379 U. S. 439</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The approach to vote dilution adopted in <em>Fortson</em> plainly consisted of a fundamental rights analysis.  If the Court had believed that the equal protection problem with alleged vote dilution was one of racial discrimination, and not abridgment of the right to vote, it would not have accorded standing to the plaintiffs, who were simply registered voters of Georgia alleging that the state apportionment plan, as a theoretical matter, diluted their voting strength because of where they lived.  To the contrary, we did not question their standing, and held against them solely because we found unpersuasive their claim on the merits.  The Court did not reach this result by inadvertence; rather, we explicitly recognized that we had adopted a fundamental rights approach when we stated that the Equal Protection Clause protected the voting strength of political, as well as racial, groups.</p>\n<p>Until today, this Court had never deviated from this principle.  We reiterated that our vote-dilution doctrine protects political groups in addition to racial groups in <em>Burns v. Richardson,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/73/case.html#88">384 U.

Chavis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/124/case.html">403 U. S. 124</a></span> (1971), we again explicitly recognized that political groups could raise such claims, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/124/case.html#143">403 U.

That assertion amounts to nothing more than a red herring:  I explicitly reject the notion that the Constitution contains any such requirement.  <em>See</em> <l=|446 55fn3="" 7|="" u.s.="">n. 7, <em>supra.</em>  The constitutional protection against vote dilution found in our prior cases does not extend to those situations in which a group has merely failed to elect representatives in proportion to its share of the population.  To prove unconstitutional vote dilution, the group is also required to carry the far more onerous burden of demonstrating that it has been effectively fenced out of the political process.  <em>See ibid.</em>  Typical of the plurality\'s mischaracterization of my position is its assertion that I would provide protection against vote dilution for "every <em>political group,\' or at least every such group that is in the minority."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#75">446 U.

The plaintiffs convinced the District Court that Mobile Negroes were unable to use alternative avenues of political influence.  They showed that Mobile Negroes still suffered pervasive present effects of massive historical official and private discrimination, and that the City Commission had been quite unresponsive to the needs of the minority community.

I continue to believe </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 446 U.

S. 149</a></span>, n. 5, and wish to explicate further why I find this standard appropriate for Fifteenth Amendment claims.  First, however, it is necessary to address the plurality\'s apparent suggestion that the Fifteenth Amendment protects against only denial, and not dilution, of the vote. [<a href="#F3/25" name="T3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer an absolute right to vote.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#62">446 U. S. 62</a></span>.  By providing that the right to vote cannot be discriminatorily "denied or abridged," however, the Amendment assuredly strikes down the diminution, as well as the outright denial, of the exercise of the franchise.  An interpretation holding that the Amendment reaches only complete abrogation of the vote would render the Amendment essentially useless, since it is no difficult task to imagine schemes in which the Negro\'s marking of the ballot is a meaningless exercise.</p>\n<p>The Court has long understood that the right to vote encompasses protection against vote dilution.  "[T]he right to have one\'s vote counted" is of the same importance as "the right to put a ballot in a box."  <em>United States v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/238/383/case.html">238 U.

Instead, they argued, and the Court recognized, that the value of their votes had been diluted by their exclusion from participation in primary elections and in the slating of candidates by political parties.  The Court\'s struggles with the concept of "state action" in those decisions were necessarily premised on the understanding that vote dilution was a claim cognizable under the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/52/case.html">376 U. S. 52</a></span> (1964), recognized that an allegation of vote dilution resulting from the drawing of district lines stated a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The plaintiffs in that case argued that congressional districting in New York violated the Fifteenth Amendment because district lines had been drawn in a racially discriminatory fashion.  Each plaintiff had access to the ballot; their complaint was that, because of intentional discrimination they resided in a district with population characteristics that had the effect of diluting the weight of their votes.  The Court treated this claim as cognizable under the Fifteenth Amendment.  More recently, in <em>United Jewish Organizations v. Carey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/144/case.html">430 U.

S. 128</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is plain, then, that the Fifteenth Amendment shares the concept of vote dilution developed in such Fourteenth Amendment decisions as <em>Reynolds v.

Dorsey, supra.</em>  In fact, under the Court\'s unified view of the protections of the right to vote accorded by disparate portions of the Constitution, the concept of vote dilution is a core principle of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Amendments, as well as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth:</p>\n<p>"The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits a State from denying or abridging a Negro\'s right to vote.  The Nineteenth Amendment does the same for women.  If a State in a state-wide election weighted the male vote more heavily than the female vote, or the white vote more heavily than the Negro vote, none could successfully contend that that discrimination was allowable.  <em>See Terry v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/345/461/case.html">345 U. S. 461</a></span>. . . .  Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote -- whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit.  This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln\'s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing -- one person, one vote."</p>\n<p><em>Gray v.

S. 381</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The plurality\'s suggestion that the Fifteenth Amendment reaches only outright denial of the ballot is wholly inconsistent not only with our prior decisions, but also with the gloss the plurality would place upon the Fourteenth Amendment\'s protection against vote dilution.  As I explained in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#105">446 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> I strongly disagree with the plurality\'s conclusion that our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 446 U. S. 129</a></p><p> Fourteenth Amendment vote-dilution decisions have been based upon the Equal Protection Clause\'s prohibition of racial discrimination.  Be that as it may, the plurality, at least, does not dispute that the Fourteenth Amendment\'s language -- that "[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws" -- protects against dilution, as well as outright denial, of the right to vote on racial grounds, even though the Amendment does not mention any right to vote, and speaks only of the denial, and not the diminution, of rights.  Yet when the plurality construes the language of the Fifteenth Amendment -- which explicitly acknowledges the right to vote and prohibits its denial or abridgment on account of race -- it seemingly would accord protection against only the absolute abrogation of the ballot.</p>\n<p>An interpretation of the Fifteenth Amendment limiting its prohibitions to the outright denial of the ballot would convert the words of the Amendment into language illusory in symbol, and hollow in substance.  Surely today\'s decision should not be read as endorsing that interpretation. [<a href="#F3/26" name="T3/26">Footnote 3/26</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The plurality concludes that our prior decisions establish the principle that proof of discriminatory intent is a necessary element of a Fifteenth Amendment claim. [<a href="#F3/27" name="T3/27">Footnote 3/27</a>]  In contrast, I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 446 U. S. 130</a></p><p> continue to adhere to my conclusion in <em>Beer v. United States,</em> 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/case.html#148">425 U. S. 148</a></span>, n. 4 (dissenting opinion), that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Court\'s decisions relating to the relevance of purpose and/or effect analysis in testing the constitutionality of legislative enactments are somewhat less than a seamless web."</p>\n<p>As I there explained, at various times, the Court\'s decisions have seemed to adopt three inconsistent approaches:  (1) that purpose alone is the test for unconstitutionality; (2) that effect alone is the test; and (3) that purpose or effect, either alone or in combination, is sufficient to show unconstitutionality.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In my view, our Fifteenth Amendment jurisprudence on the necessity of proof of discriminatory purpose is no less unsettled than was our approach to the importance of such proof in Fourteenth Amendment racial discrimination cases prior to <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U. S. 229</a></span> (1976).  What is called for in the present cases is a fresh consideration -- similar to our inquiry in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> with regard to Fourteenth Amendment discrimination claims -- of whether proof of discriminatory purpose is necessary to establish a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  I will first justify my conclusion that our Fifteenth Amendment precedents do not control the outcome of this issue, and then turn to an examination of how the question should be resolved.</p>\n<p><em>1\n</em></p>\n<p>The plurality cites <em>Guinn v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/238/347/case.html">238 U. S. 347</a></span> (1915); <em>Gomillion v.

S. 268</a></span> (1939), as holding that proof of discriminatory purpose is necessary to support a Fifteenth Amendment claim.  To me, these decisions indicate confusion, not resolution of this issue.  As the plurality suggests, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#62">446 U. S. 62</a></span>, the Court in <em>Guinn v. United States, supra,</em> did examine the purpose of a "grandfather clause" in the course of invalidating it.  Yet, 24 years later, in <em>Lane v. Wilson, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/277/case.html">307 U. S. 277</a></span>, the Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 446 U.

S. 455</a></span>, and n. 7 (1931), the Court in <em>Lane</em> seemingly did not question the motives of public officials.</p>\n<p>In upholding the use of a literacy test for voters in <em>Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., supra,</em> the Court apparently concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove either discriminatory purpose or effect.  <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra,</em> can be read as turning on proof of discriminatory motive, but the Court also stressed that the challenged redrawing of municipal boundaries had the "essential inevitable effect" of removing Negro voters from the city, 364 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html#341">364 U.

S. 347</a></span>.  Finally, in <em>Wright v. Rockefeller, supra,</em> the plaintiffs alleged only purposeful discriminatory redistricting, and therefore the Court had no reason to consider whether proof of discriminatory effect would satisfy the Fifteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F3/28" name="T3/28">Footnote 3/28</a>]</p>\n<p>The plurality ignores cases suggesting that discriminatory purpose is not necessary to support a Fifteenth Amendment claim.  In <em>Terry v.

S. 385</a></span>, interpreted <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra,</em> as turning on the discriminatory effect, and not the alleged discriminatory purpose, of the challenged redrawing of municipal boundaries.  Three years later, in <em>Palmer v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/217/case.html">403 U. S. 217</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/217/case.html#224">403 U. S. 224</a></span>-225 (1971), the Court relied on <em>O\'Brien</em> to support its refusal to inquire whether a city had closed its swimming pools to avoid racial integration.  As in <em>O\'Brien,</em> the Court in <em>Palmer, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/217/case.html#225">403 U. S. 225</a></span>, interpreted <em>Gomillion v.

S. 461</a></span>-462 (1972).</p>\n<p>In holding that racial discrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause must be supported by proof of discriminatory intent, the Court in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> signaled some movement away from the doctrine that such proof is irrelevant to constitutional adjudication.  Although the Court, 426 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html#242">426 U. S. 242</a></span>-244, and n. 11, attempted mightily to distinguish <em>Palmer v. Thompson, supra,</em> its decision was, in fact, based upon a judgment that, in light of modern circumstances, the Equal Protection Clause\'s ban on racial discrimination in the distribution of constitutional gratuities should be interpreted as prohibiting only intentional official discrimination. [<a href="#F3/30" name="T3/30">Footnote 3/30</a>]</p>\n<p>These vacillations in our approach to the relevance of discriminatory purpose belie the plurality\'s determination that our prior decisions require such proof to support Fifteenth Amendment claims.  To the contrary, the Court today is in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 446 U. S. 133</a></p><p> the same unsettled position with regard to the Fifteenth Amendment as it was four years ago in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> regarding the Fourteenth Amendment\'s prohibition of racial discrimination.  The absence of old answers mandates a new inquiry.</p>\n<p><em>2\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Washington v. Davis</em> required a showing of discriminatory purpose to support racial discrimination claims largely because it feared that a standard based solely on disproportionate impact would unduly interfere with the far-ranging governmental distribution of constitutional gratuities. [<a href="#F3/31" name="T3/31">Footnote 3/31</a>]  Underlying the Court\'s decision was a determination that, since the Constitution does not entitle any person to such governmental benefits, courts should accord discretion to those officials who decide how the government shall allocate its scarce resources.  If the plaintiff proved only that governmental distribution of constitutional gratuities had a disproportionate effect on a racial minority, the Court was willing to presume that the officials who approved the allocation scheme either had made an honest error or had foreseen that the decision would have a discriminatory impact, and had found persuasive, legitimate reasons for imposing it nonetheless.  These assumptions about the good faith of officials allowed the Court to conclude that, standing alone, a showing that a governmental policy had a racially discriminatory impact did not indicate that the affected minority had suffered the stigma, frustration, and unjust treatment prohibited </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 446 U. S. 134</a></p><p> under the suspect classification branch of our equal protection jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>Such judicial deference to official decisionmaking has no place under the Fifteenth Amendment.  Section 1 of that Amendment differs from the Fourteenth Amendment\'s prohibition on racial discrimination in two crucial respects:  it explicitly recognizes the right to vote free of hindrances related to race, and it sweeps no further.  In my view, these distinctions justify the conclusion that proof of racially discriminatory impact should be sufficient to support a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The right to vote is of such fundamental importance in the constitutional scheme that the Fifteenth Amendment\'s command that it shall not be "abridged" on account of race must be interpreted as providing that the votes of citizens of all races shall be of substantially equal weight.  Furthermore, a disproportionate impact test under the Fifteenth Amendment would not lead to constant judicial intrusion into the process of official decisionmaking.  Rather, the standard would reach only those decisions having a discriminatory effect upon the minority\'s vote.  The Fifteenth Amendment cannot tolerate that kind of decision, even if made in good faith, because the Amendment grants racial minorities the full enjoyment of the right to vote, not simply protection against the unfairness of intentional vote dilution along racial lines. [<a href="#F3/32" name="T3/32">Footnote 3/32</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, it is beyond dispute that a standard based solely upon the motives of official decisionmakers creates significant problems of proof for plaintiffs and forces the inquiring court to undertake an unguided, tortuous look into the minds of officials in the hope of guessing why certain policies were adopted and others rejected.  <em>See Palmer v. Thompson,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 446 U. S. 135</a></p><p> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/217/case.html#224">403 U.

An approach based on motivation creates the risk that officials will be able to adopt policies that are the products of discriminatory intent so long as they sufficiently mask their motives through the use of subtlety and illusion.  <em>Washington v. Davis</em> is premised on the notion that this risk is insufficient to overcome the deference the judiciary must accord to governmental decisions about the distribution of constitutional gratuities.  That risk becomes intolerable, however, when the precious right to vote protected by the Fifteenth Amendment is concerned.</p>\n<p>I continue to believe, then, that under the Fifteenth Amendment, an</p>\n<p>"[e]valuation of the purpose of a legislative enactment is just too ambiguous a task to be the sole tool of constitutional analysis. . . .

One useful evidentiary tool, long recognized by the common law, is the presumption that "[e]very man must be taken to contemplate the probable consequences of the act he does."  <em>Townsend v. Wathen,</em> 9 East. 277, 280, 103 Eng.Rep. 579, 580-581 (K.B. 1808).  The Court in <em>Feeney, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/case.html#279">442 U. S. 279</a></span>, n. 25, acknowledged that proof of foreseeability of discriminatory consequences could raise a "strong inference that the adverse effects were desired," but refused to treat this presumption as conclusive in cases alleging discriminatory distribution of constitutional gratuities.</p>\n<p>I would apply the common law foreseeability presumption to the present cases.  The plaintiffs surely proved that maintenance of the challenged multimember districting would have the foreseeable effect of perpetuating the submerged electoral influence of Negroes, and that this discriminatory effect could be corrected by implementation of a single-member districting plan. [<a href="#F3/36" name="T3/36">Footnote 3/36</a>]  Because the foreseeable disproportionate impact was so severe, the burden of proof should have shifted to the defendants, and they should have been required to show that they refused to modify the districting schemes in spite of, not because of, their severe discriminatory effect.  <em>See Feeney, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/case.html#284">442 U. S. 284</a></span> (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Reallocation of the burden of proof is especially appropriate in these cases, where the challenged state action infringes the exercise of a fundamental right.

Furthermore, if proof of discriminatory purpose is to be required in these cases, this standard would comport with my view that the degree to which the government must justify a decision depends upon the importance of the interests infringed by it.  <em>See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v.

[<a href="#F3/38" name="T3/38">Footnote 3/38</a>]  Like outright racial hostility, selective racial indifference reflects a belief that the concerns of the minority are not worthy of the same degree of attention paid to problems perceived by whites.  When an interest as fundamental as voting is diminished along racial lines, a requirement that discriminatory purpose must be proved should be satisfied by a showing that official action was produced by this type of pervasive bias.  In the present cases, the plaintiffs presented strong evidence of such bias:  they showed that Mobile officials historically discriminated against Negroes, that there are pervasive present effects of this past discrimination, and that officials have not been responsive to the needs of the minority community.  It takes only the smallest of inferential leaps to conclude that the decisions to maintain multimember districting having obvious discriminatory effects represent, at the very least, selective racial sympathy and indifference resulting in the frustration of minority desires, the stigmatization of the minority as second-class citizens, and the perpetuation of inhumanity.

The plurality\'s requirement of proof of intentional discrimination, so inappropriate in today\'s cases, may represent an attempt to bury the legitimate concerns of the minority beneath the soil of a doctrine almost as impermeable as it is serious.  If so, the superficial tranquility created by such measures can be but short-lived.  If this Court refuses to honor our long-recognized principle that the Constitution "nullifies sophisticated, as well as simple-minded, modes of discrimination," <em>Lane v.

Multimember districting greatly enhances the opportunity of the majority political faction to elect all representatives of the district.  In contrast, if the multimember district is divided into several single-member districts, an electoral minority will have a better chance to elect a candidate of its choice, or at least to exert greater political influence.  It is obvious that the greater the degree to which the electoral minority is homogeneous and insular, and the greater the degree that bloc voting occurs along majority-minority lines, the greater will be the extent to which the minority\'s voting power is diluted by multimember districting.  <em>See</em> E. Banfield &amp; J. Wilson, City Politics 91-96, 303-308 (1963); R. Dixon, Jr., Democratic Representation 12, 476-484, 503-527 (1968); Bonapfel, Minority Challenges to At-Large Elections :  The Dilution Problem, 10 Ga.L.Rev. 353, 35860 (1976); Derfner, Racial Discrimination and the Right to Vote, 26 Vand.L.Rev. 523, 553-555 (1973); Comment, Effective Representation and Multimember Districts, 68 Mich.L.Rev. 1577, 1577-1579 (170).  Recent empirical studies have documented the validity of this generalization.  <em>See</em> Berry &amp; Dye, The Discriminatory Effects of At-Large Elections, 7 Fla.St.U.L.Rev. 85, 113-122 (1979); Jones, The Impact of Local Election Systems on Black Political Representation, 11 Urb.Aff.Q. 345 (1976); Karnig, Black Resources and City Council Representation, 41 J.Pol. 134 (1979); Karnig, Black Representation on City Councils:  The Impact of District Elections and Socioeconomic Factors, 12 Urb.Aff.Q. 223 (1976); Sloan, "Good Government" and the Politics of Race, 17 Soc.Prob. 161 (1969); The Impact of Municipal Reformism:  A Symposium, 59 Soc.Sci.Q. 117 (1978).</p>\n<p>The electoral schemes in these cases involve majority-vote, numbered-post, and staggered-term requirements.  <em>See Bolden v. City of Mobile,</em> 423 F.Supp. 384, 386-387 (SD Ala.1976); <em>Brown v. Moore,</em> 428 F.Supp. 1123, 1126-1127 (SD Ala.1976).  These electoral rules exacerbate the vote-dilutive effects of multimember districting.  A requirement that a candidate must win by a majority of the vote forces a minority candidate who wins a plurality of votes in the general election to engage in a runoff election with his nearest competitor.  If the competitor is a member of the dominant political faction, the minority candidate stands little chance of winning in the second election.  A requirement that each candidate must run for a particular "place" or "post" creates head-to-head contests that minority candidates cannot survive.  When a number of positions on a governmental body are to be chosen in the same election, members of a minority will increase the likelihood of election of a favorite candidate by voting only for him.  If the remainder of the electorate splits its votes among the other candidates, the minority\'s candidate might well be elected by the minority\'s "single-shot voting."  If the terms of the officeholders are staggered, the opportunity for single-shot voting is decreased.  <em>See City of Rome v.

To the contrary, local governments are not exempt from the constitutional requirement to adopt representational districting ensuring that the votes of each citizen will have equal weight.  <em>Avery v. Midland County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/474/case.html">390 U. S. 474</a></span> (1968).  Indeed, in <em>Beer v.

Mundt, supra,</em> there is all the more reason to scrutinize assertions that municipal, rather than state, multimember districting dilutes the vote of an electoral minority:</p>\n<p>"In statewide elections, it is possible that a large minority group in one multi-member district will be unable to elect any legislators, while in another multi-member district where the same group is a slight majority, they will elect the entire slate of legislators.  Thus, the multi-member electoral system may hinder a group in one district, but prove an advantage in another.  In at-large elections in cities, this is not possible.  There is no way to balance out the discrimination against a particular minority group, because the entire city is one huge election district.  The minority\'s loss is absolute."</p>\n<p>Berry &amp; Dye, <em>supra,</em> n. 3, at 87.  That at-large elections were instituted as part of a "reform" movement in no way ameliorates these harsh effects.  Moreover, in some instances, the efficiency and breadth of perspective supposedly resulting from a reform structure of municipal government are achieved at a high cost.  In a white-majority city in which severe racial bloc voting is common, the city-wide view allegedly inculcated in city commissioners by at-large elections need not extend beyond the white community, and the efficiency of the commission form of government can be achieved simply by ignoring the concerns of the powerless minority.</p>\n<p>It would be a mistake, then, to conclude that municipal at-large elections provide an inherently superior representational scheme.  <em>See also</em> <l=|446 3|="" 55fn3="" u.s.="">n. 3, <em>supra;</em> <em>Chapman v.

S. 1</a></span> (1975).  It goes without saying that a municipality has the freedom to design its own governance system.  When that system is subjected to constitutional attack, however, the question is whether it was enacted or maintained with a discriminatory purpose or has a discriminatory effect, not whether it comports with one or another of the competing notions about "good government."</l=|446></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>As the plurality notes, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#66">446 U.

Regester</em> makes clear the distinction between the concepts of vote dilution and proportional representation.  We have held that, in order to prove an allegation of vote dilution, the plaintiffs must show more than simply that they have been unable to elect candidates of their choice.  <em>See</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#765">412 U.

The Constitution, therefore, does not contain any requirement of proportional representation.  <em>Cf. United Jewish Organizations v. Carey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/144/case.html">430 U. S. 144</a></span> (1977); <em>Gaffney v. Cummings,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html">412 U. S. 735</a></span> (1973).  When all that is proved is mere lack of success at the polls, the Court will not presume that members of a political minority have suffered an impermissible dilution of political power.  Rather, it is assumed that these persons have means available to them through which they can have some effect on governmental decisionmaking.  For example, many of these persons might belong to a variety of other political, social, and economic groups that have some impact on officials.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that officials will not be improperly influenced by such factors as the race or place of residence of persons seeking governmental action.  Furthermore, political factions out of office often serve as watchdogs on the performance of the government, bind together into coalitions having enhanced influence, and have the respectability necessary to affect public policy.</p>\n<p>Unconstitutional vote dilution occurs only when a discrete political minority whose voting strength is diminished by a districting scheme proves that historical and social factors render it largely incapable of effectively utilizing alternative avenues of influencing public policy.  <em>See</em> <l=|446 19|="" 55fn3="" u.s.="">n.19, <em>infra.</em>  In these circumstances, the only means of breaking down the barriers encasing the political arena is to structure the electoral districting so that the minority has a fair opportunity to elect candidates of its choice.</l=|446></p>\n<p>The test for unconstitutional vote dilution, then, looks only to the discriminatory effects of the combination of an electoral structure and historical and social factors.  At the same time, it requires electoral minorities to prove far more than mere lack of success at the polls.</p>\n<p>We have also spoken of dilution of voting power in cases arising under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973 <em>et seq.</em>  Under \xc2\xa7 5 of that Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973c, a state or local government covered by the Act may not enact new electoral procedures having the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.  We have interpreted this provision as prohibiting any retrogression in Negro voting power.  <em>Beer v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/case.html">425 U.

The plurality fails to articulate why the right to vote should receive such singular treatment.  Furthermore, the plurality refuses to recognize the disutility of requiring proof of discriminatory purpose in fundamental rights cases.  For example, it would make no sense to require such a showing when the question is whether a state statute regulating abortion violates the right of personal choice recognized in <em>Roe v.

The Court certainly did not suggest, however, that violations of the right to effective political participation mattered only if they were caused by malapportionment.

To the contrary, the Court has accepted at face value the purposes articulated for a qualification of this right, and has invalidated such a limitation under the Equal Protection Clause only if its purpose either lacked sufficient substantiality when compared to the individual interests affected or could have been achieved by less restrictive means.  <em>See, e.g., Dunn v.

However, <em>where what is denied is something to which the complainant has a substantive constitutional right</em> -- either because it is granted by the terms of the Constitution or because it is essential to the effective functioning of a democratic government -- <em>the reasons it was denied are irrelevant.</em>  It may become important in court what justifications counsel for the state can <em>articulate</em> in support of its denial or nonprovision, but the reasons that actually inspired the denial never can:  to have a right to something is to have a claim on it irrespective of why it is denied.  It would be a tragedy of the first order were the Court to expand its burgeoning awareness of the relevance of motivation into the thoroughly mistaken notion that a denial of a constitutional right does not count as such unless it was intentional."</p>\n<p>Ely, The Centrality and Limits of Motivation Analysis, 15 San Diego L.Rev. 1155, 1160-1161 (1978) (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/22" name="F3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>]</p>\n<p>It is at this point that my view most diverges from the position expressed by my Brother STEVENS, <em>ante.</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#83">446 U.

The facts of the present cases, however, demonstrate that severe and persistent racial bloc voting, when coupled with the inability of the minority effectively to participate in the political arena by alternative means, can effectively disable the individual Negro, as well as the minority community as a whole.  In these circumstances, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS\' distinction between the rights of individuals and the political strength of groups becomes illusory.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/23" name="F3/23">Footnote 3/23</a>]</p>\n<p>The foregoing disposes of any contention that, merely by citing <em>Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/52/case.html">376 U. S. 52</a></span> (1964), the Court in <em>Washington v.

S. 264</a></span>, intended to bring vote-dilution cases within the discriminatory purpose requirement.  <em>Wright v. Rockefeller, supra,</em> was a racial gerrymander case, and the plaintiffs had alleged only that they were the victims of an intentional scheme to draw districting lines discriminatorily.  In focusing solely on whether the plaintiffs had proved intentional discrimination, the Court in <em>Wright v. Rockefeller</em> was merely limiting the scope of its inquiry to the issue raised by the plaintiffs.  If <em>Wright v. Rockefeller</em> had been brought after this Court had decided our vote-dilution decisions, the plaintiffs perhaps would have recognized that, in addition to a claim of intentional racial gerrymandering, they could allege an equally sufficient cause of action under the Equal Protection Clause -- that the districting lines had the effect of diluting their vote.</p>\n<p><em>Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> then, treated proof of discriminatory purpose as a sufficient condition to trigger strict scrutiny of a districting scheme, but had no occasion to consider whether such proof was necessary to invoke that standard.  Its citations in <em>Washington v. Davis, supra,</em> and <em>Arlington Heights; supra,</em> were useful to show the relevancy, but not the necessity, of evidence of discriminatory intent.  These citations are in no way inconsistent with my view that proof of discriminatory purpose is not a necessary condition to the invalidation of multimember districts that dilute the vote of racial or political elements.</p>\n<p>In addition, any argument that, merely by citing <em>Wright v. Rockefeller,</em> the Court in <em>Washington v. Davis</em> and <em>Arlington Heights</em> intended to apply the discriminatory intent requirement to vote-dilution claims is premised on two unpalatable assumptions.  First, because the discussion of <em>Wright v. Rockefeller</em> was unnecessary to the resolution of the issues in both of those decisions, the argument assumes that the Court in both cases decided important issues in brief dicta.  Second, the argument assumes that the Court twice intended covertly to overrule the discriminatory effects test applied in <em>White v. Regester,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html">412 U. S. 755</a></span> (1973), without even citing <em>White.</em>  Neither assumption is tenable.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/24" name="F3/24">Footnote 3/24</a>]</p>\n<p>It is important to recognize that only the four Members of the plurality are committed to this view.  In addition to my Brother BRENNAN and myself, my Brother STEVENS expressly states that proof of discriminatory effect can be a sufficient condition to support the invalidation of districting, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#90">446 U. S. 90</a></span>.  My Brother WHITE finds the proof of discriminatory purpose in these cases sufficient to support the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, and, accordingly, he does not reach the issue whether proof of discriminatory impact, standing alone, would suffice under the Fifteenth Amendment.  My Brother BLACKMUN also expresses no view on this issue, since he too finds the proof of discriminatory intent sufficient to support the findings of violations of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/25" name="F3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]</p>\n<p>The plurality states that,</p>\n<p>"[h]aving found that Negroes in Mobile \'register and vote without hindrance,\' the District Court and Court of Appeals were in error in believing that the appellants invaded the protection of that Amendment in the present case."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#65">446 U.

In addition to my Brother BRENNAN and myself, my Brother STEVENS expressly states that the Fifteenth Amendment protects against diminution as well as denial of the ballot, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">446 U.

It is plain that the District Court in both of the cases before us made the "intensely local appraisal" necessary under <em>White, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#769">412 U. S. 769</a></span>, and correctly decided that the at-large electoral schemes for the Mobile City Commission and County School Board violated the <em>White</em> standard.  As I earlier note with respect to No. 77-1844, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#122">446 U. S. 122</a></span>-123, the District Court determined:  (1) that Mobile Negroes still suffered pervasive present effects of massive historical official and private discrimination; (2) that the City Commission and County School Board had been quite unresponsive to the needs of the minority community; (3) that no Negro had ever been elected to either body, despite the fact that Negroes constitute about one-third of the electorate; (4) that the persistence of severe racial bloc voting made it highly unlikely that any Negro could be elected at large to either body in the foreseeable future; and (5) that no state policy favored at-large elections, and the local preference for that scheme was outweighed by the fact that the unconstitutional vote dilution could be corrected only by the imposition of single-member districts.  <em>Bolden v. City of Mobile,</em> 423 F.Supp. 384 (SD Ala.1976); <em>Brown v. Moore,</em> 428 F.Supp. 1123 (SD Ala.1976).  The Court of Appeals affirmed these findings in all respects.  <em>Bolden v.

JUSTICE STEVENS acknowledges that both discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect are present in No. 77-1844.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#92">446 U.

Nonetheless, he finds no constitutional violation, apparently because he believes that the electoral structure of Mobile conforms to a commonly used scheme, the discriminatory impact is, in his view, not extraordinary, and the structure is supported by sufficient noninvidious justifications so that it is neither wholly irrational nor entirely motivated by discriminatory animus.  To him, racially motivated decisions in this setting are an inherent part of the political process, and do not involve invidious discrimination.</p>\n<p>The facts of the present cases, however, indicate that, in Mobile, considerations of race are far more powerful and pernicious than are considerations of other divisive aspects of the electorate.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#122">446 U.

An approach that accepts intentional discrimination against Negroes as merely an aspect of "politics as usual" strikes at the very hearts of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/38" name="F3/38">Footnote 3/38</a>]</p>\n<p>Brest, The Supreme Court, 1975 Term -- Foreword:  In Defense of the Antidiscrimination Principle, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 7 (1976).  <em>See also</em> Note, Racial Vote Dilution in Multimember Districts:  The Constitutional Standard After <em>Washington v. Davis,</em> 76 Mich.L.Rev. 694, 716-719 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/39" name="F3/39">Footnote 3/39</a>]</p>\n<p>The plurality, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#74">446 U. S. 74</a></span>-75, n. 21, indicates that, on remand, the lower courts are to examine the evidence in these cases under the discriminatory intent standard of <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/case.html">442 U. S. 256</a></span> (1979), and may conclude that this test is met by proof of the refusal of Mobile\'s state legislative delegation to stimulate the passage of legislation changing Mobile\'s city government into a mayor-council system in which council members are elected from single-member districts.  The plurality concludes, then, only that the District Court and the Court of Appeals in each of the present cases evaluated the evidence under an improper legal standard, and not that the evidence fails to support a claim under <em>Feeney, supra.</em>  When the lower courts examine these cases under the <em>Feeney</em> standard, they should, of course, recognize the relevancy of the plaintiffs\' evidence that vote dilution was a foreseeable and natural consequence of the maintenance of the challenged multimember districting, and that officials have apparently exhibited selective racial sympathy and indifference.  <em>Cf. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/526/case.html">443 U. S. 526</a></span> (1979); <em>Columbus Board of Education v. Penick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/449/case.html">443 U. S. 449</a></span> (1979).</p>\n<p>Finally, it is important not to confuse the differing views the plurality and I have on the elements of proving unconstitutional vote dilution.  The plurality concludes that proof of intentional discrimination, as defined in <em>Feeney, supra,</em> is necessary to support such a claim.  The plurality finds this requirement consistent with the statement in <em>White v. Regester,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html#766">412 U. S. 766</a></span>, that unconstitutional vote dilution does not occur simply because a minority has not been able to elect representatives in proportion to its voting potential.  The extra necessary element, according to the plurality, is a showing of discriminatory intent.  In the plurality\'s view, the evidence presented in <em>White</em> going beyond mere proof of underrepresentation of the minority properly supported an inference that the multimember districting scheme in question was tainted with a discriminatory purpose.</p>\n<p>The plurality\'s approach should be satisfied, then, by proof that an electoral scheme enacted with a discriminatory purpose effected a retrogression in the minority\'s voting power.  <em>Cf. Beer v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/case.html">425 U. S. 130</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/case.html#141">425 U. S. 141</a></span> (1976).  The standard should also be satisfied by proof that a scheme maintained for a discriminatory purpose has the effect of submerging minority electoral influence below the level it would have under a reasonable alternative scheme.</p>\n<p>The plurality does not address the question whether proof of discriminatory effect is necessary to support a vote-dilution claim.  It is clear from the above, however, that, if the Court at some point creates such a requirement, it would be satisfied by proof of mere disproportionate impact.  Such a requirement would be far less stringent than the burden of proof required under the rather rigid discriminatory effects test I find in <em>White v. Regester, supra.</em> <em>See</em> <l=|446 55fn3="" 7|="" u.s.="">n. 7, <em>supra,</em> and accompanying text.</l=|446></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
