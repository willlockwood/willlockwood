Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73041(b) (West Supp. 2010).  If the Board denies parole, the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas petition.  The California Supreme Court has explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe standard of review properly is characterized as whether \xe2\x80\x98some evidence\xe2\x80\x99 supports the conclusion that the inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently is dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Lawrence</em>, 44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190 P.\xc2\xa03d 535, 539 (2008).

In November 2002, the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for parole, basing its decision on the \xe2\x80\x9cespecially cruel and callous manner\xe2\x80\x9d of his commitment offense, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilitative programs; his failure to develop marketable skills; and three incidents of misconduct while in prison.  The board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psychological report, but it dismissed the report as not credible because it included several inconsistent and erroneous statements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court.  The court denied his petition.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe record indicates,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was some evidence, including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to support the board\xe2\x80\x99s denial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 42a.  Cooke subsequently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California Supreme Court.  Both were denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 challenging the parole board\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  The District Court denied his petition.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that California\xe2\x80\x99s parole statute created a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, and that \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98some evidence\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d was a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d of that federally protected liberty interest.  <em>Cooke</em> v. <em>Solis</em>, 606 F.\xc2\xa03d 1206, 1213 (2010).  It then concluded that the state court had made an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) by finding any evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public safety if released.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1215.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree murder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of parole.  In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole, but the Governor exercised his authority to review the case and found Clay unsuitable for parole.  See Cal. Const., Art. 5, \xc2\xa78(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa73041.2 (West 2000).  The Governor cited the gravity of Clay\xe2\x80\x99s crime;\nhis extensive criminal history, which reflected \xe2\x80\x9cthe culmination of a life of crime,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;\nhis failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being paroled.  Regarding the last factor, the Governor concluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given his propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable means of employment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court.  That court denied Clay\xe2\x80\x99s petition, as did the California Court of Appeal.  The California Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court granted.  The District Court concluded that the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the nature of Clay\xe2\x80\x99s long-past commitment offense vio-lated Clay\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process, and dismissed each of\nthe other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the record.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Governor\xe2\x80\x99s decision was an unreasonable application of California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98some evidence\xe2\x80\x99 rule and was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Kane</em>, 384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that the state courts had misapplied California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard is required by the federal Due Process Clause.  Neither assumption is correct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first: The habeas statute \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously provides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner \xe2\x80\x98only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Corcoran</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) <em>(per curiam) </em>(slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(a)).  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have stated many times that \xe2\x80\x98federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>McGuire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/62/index.html">502 U. S. 62</a>, 67 (1991) (quoting <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Jeffers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/764/index.html">497 U. S. 764</a>, 780 (1990)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the\nprocedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient.  <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/index.html">490 U. S. 454</a>, 460 (1989).  Here, the Ninth Circuit held that California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1213.  While we have no need to review that holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.  See <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/369/index.html">482 U. S. 369</a>, 373\xe2\x80\x93381 (1987); <em>Greenholtz</em> v. <em>Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/1/index.html">442 U. S. 1</a>, 12 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a <em>state </em>interest created by California law.  There is no right under the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners.  <em>Id., </em>at 7.  When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindication\xe2\x80\x94and federal courts will review the application of those constitutionally required procedures.  In the context of parole, we have held that the procedures required are minimal.  In <em>Greenholtz</em>, we found that a prisoner subject to a parole statute similar to California\xe2\x80\x99s received adequate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why parole was denied.  442 U. S., at 16.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require more.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> Cooke and Clay received at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied.  606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1208\xe2\x80\x931212; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a\xe2\x80\x9380a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73041, 3041.5 (West Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That should have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry into whether Cooke and Clay received due process.  Instead, however, the Court of Appeals reviewed the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions on the merits and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the facts in light of the evidence.  See 606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1213\xe2\x80\x931216; 384 Fed. Appx., at 545\xe2\x80\x93546.  Other Ninth Circuit cases have done the same.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Muntz</em>, 606 F.\xc2\xa03d 606, 611 (2010).  No opinion of ours supports converting California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d rule into a substantive federal requirement.  The liberty interest at issue here is the interest in receiving parole when the California standards for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures adequate for due-process protection of that interest are those set forth in <em>Greenholtz</em>.*<footcall num="*">  See <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Marshall</em>, 603 F.\xc2\xa03d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc).  <em>Greenholtz </em>did not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that the evidence required; <em>a fortiori </em>it is no federal concern here whether California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d rule of judicial review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution demands) was correctly applied.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It will not do to pronounce California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d rule to be \xe2\x80\x9ca component\xe2\x80\x9d of the liberty interest, 606 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1213.  Such reasoning would subject to federal-court merits review the application of all state-prescribed procedures in cases involving liberty or property interests, including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions.  That has never been the law.  To the contrary, we have long recognized that \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98mere error of state law\xe2\x80\x99 is not a denial of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/107/index.html">456 U. S. 107</a>, 121, n.\xc2\xa021 (1982); see also <em>Estelle</em>, 502 U. S., at 67\xe2\x80\x9368.  Because the only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s questionable finding that there was <em>no </em>evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as \xc2\xa72254(a) requires.  See <em>id.</em>, at 67.  The short of the matter is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing California\xe2\x80\x99s parole system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s business.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motions for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgments below are</p>\n<p align="left">Reversed.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the revocation of good-time credits should apply, citing <em>In\xc2\xa0re Rosenkrantz</em>, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 657\xe2\x80\x93658, 59 P.\xc2\xa03d 174, 205 (2002), a California Supreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in <em>Superintendent</em>,<em> Mass.

The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discussing the need for \xe2\x80\x9csome evidence\xe2\x80\x9d review in parole decisions, simply borrows language from <em>Hill</em> to support the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[r]equiring a modicum of evidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 205 (quoting <em>Hill</em>, 472 U.
