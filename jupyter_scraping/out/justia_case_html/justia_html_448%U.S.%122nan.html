Ultimately, the case was settled and the District Court entered a consent decree that provided for a substantial increase in the standard allowances for work-related expenses and gave AFDC recipients the right to prove that their actual work-related expenses were in excess of the standard.  The District Court then awarded respondent\'s counsel a fee pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988, which provides that, in any action to enforce 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, <em>inter alia,</em> the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\'s fee as part of the costs.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney\'s fee as part of the award of costs. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The question presented by this petition is whether fees may be assessed against state officials after a case has been settled by the entry of a consent decree, without any determination that the plaintiff\'s constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n<p>Petitioner is responsible for the administration of Connecticut\'s Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), a federally funded public assistance program. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent is a working recipient of AFDC benefits.  Under state and federal regulations, the amount of her benefits depends, in part, on her net earnings, which are defined as her wages minus certain work-related expenses.  In 1975, respondent filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that Connecticut\'s AFDC regulations denied her credit for substantial portions of her actual work-related expenses, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] thus reducing the level of her benefits.  Her </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 448 U. S. 125</a></p><p> complaint alleged that these regulations violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(7), [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The complaint further alleged that relief was authorized by 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and invoked federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71343. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 448 U. S. 126</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A few months after the action was commenced, while discovery was underway, petitioner amended the AFDC regulations to authorize a deduction for all reasonable work-related expenses.  After an interval of almost a year and a half, respondent filed an amended complaint alleging that actual expenses in excess of certain standard allowances were still being routinely disallowed.  Thereafter, a settlement was negotiated and the District Court entered a consent decree that, among other things, provided for a substantial increase in the standard allowances and gave AFDC recipients the right to prove that their actual work-related expenses were in excess of the standard. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The parties informally agreed that the question whether respondent was entitled to recover attorney\'s fees would be submitted to the District Court after the entry of the consent decree.</p>\n<p>Following an adversary hearing, the District Court awarded respondent\'s counsel a fee of $3,012.19.  455 F.Supp. 1344 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 448 U. S. 127</a></p><p> (1978).  The court held that respondent was the "prevailing party" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1988 because, while not prevailing "in every particular," she had won "substantially all of the relief originally sought in her complaint" in the consent decree.  <em>Id.</em> at 1347.  The court also rejected petitioner\'s argument that an award of fees against him was barred by the Eleventh Amendment in the absence of a judicial determination that respondent\'s constitutional rights had been violated.  Relying on the basic policy against deciding constitutional claims unnecessarily, the court held that respondent was entitled to fees under the Act because, in addition to her statutory claim, she had alleged constitutional claims that were sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction under the reasoning of <em>Hagans v. Lavine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html">415 U. S. 528</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed, 594 F.2d 336 (CA2 1979), holding that Congress intended to authorize an award of fees in this kind of situation and that it had the constitutional power to do so. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We granted certiorari to consider both the statutory and constitutional questions.  444 U.S. 824. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 448 U. S. 128</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s first argument is that Congress did not intend to authorize the award of attorney\'s fees in every type of \xc2\xa7 1983 action, but rather limited the courts\' authority to award fees to cases in which \xc2\xa7 1983 is invoked as a remedy for a constitutional violation or a violation of a federal statute providing for the protection of civil rights or equal rights.  In support of this contention, petitioner relies on our holding in <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U. S. 600</a></span>, that there is no federal jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343 over \xc2\xa7 1983 claims outside these categories, and that there is therefore no jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343 over a \xc2\xa7 1983 claim based solely on a violation of the Social Security Act.  Characterizing respondent\'s claim in this case as arising solely out of a Social Security Act violation, petitioner argues that the District Court had no authority under \xc2\xa7 1988 to award her attorney\'s fees.</p>\n<p>Even if petitioner\'s characterization of respondent\'s claim were correct, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] his argument would have to be rejected.  In <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span>, decided this day, we hold that \xc2\xa7 1988 applies to all types of \xc2\xa7 1983 actions, including actions based solely on Social Security Act violations.  As MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s opinion for the Court in <em>Thiboutot</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 448 U. S. 129</a></p><p> demonstrates, neither the language of \xc2\xa7 1988 nor its legislative history provides any basis for importing the distinctions <em>Chapman</em> made among \xc2\xa7 1983 actions for purposes of federal jurisdiction into the award of attorney\'s fees by a court that possesses jurisdiction over the claim. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>We also find no merit in petitioner\'s suggestion that respondent was not the "prevailing party" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1988.  The fact that respondent prevailed through a settlement, rather than through litigation, does not weaken her claim to fees.  Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa7 1988 conditions the District Court\'s power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff\'s rights have been violated.  Moreover, the Senate Report expressly stated that,</p>\n<p>"for purposes of the award of counsel fees, parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 91011, p. 5 (1976).</p>\n<p>Nor can we accept petitioner\'s contention that respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 448 U. S. 130</a></p><p> did not gain sufficient relief through the consent decree to be considered the prevailing party.  The District Court\'s contrary finding was based on its familiarity with the progress of the litigation through the pleading, discovery, and settlement negotiation stages.  That finding was upheld by the Court of Appeals, and we see no reason to question its validity.  <em>See Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/271/case.html">336 U. S. 271</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/271/case.html#275">336 U. S. 275</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s second argument is that, regardless of Congress\' intent, a federal court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment from awarding fees against a State in a case involving a purely statutory, non-civil-rights claim. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Petitioner argues that Congress may empower federal courts to award fees against the States only insofar as it is exercising its power under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce substantive rights conferred by that Amendment.  Thus, petitioner contends that fees can only be assessed in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions brought to vindicate Fourteenth Amendment rights or to enforce civil rights statutes that were themselves enacted pursuant to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, there is no need to reach the question whether a federal court could award attorney\'s fees against a State based on a statutory, non-civil-rights claim.  For, contrary to petitioner\'s characterization, respondent did allege violations of her Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 448 U. S. 131</a></p><p> rights, which the District Court and the Court of Appeals both held to be sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction under <em>Hagans v. Lavine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html">415 U. S. 528</a></span>.  Although petitioner is correct that the trial judge did not find any constitutional violation, the constitutional issues remained in the case until the entire dispute was settled by the entry of a consent decree.  Under these circumstances, petitioner\'s Eleventh Amendment claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Hutto v. Finney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/678/case.html">437 U. S. 678</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Hutto,</em> we rejected the argument of the Attorney General of Arkansas that the general language of \xc2\xa7 1988 was insufficient to overcome a State\'s claim of immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, noting that "[t]he Court has never viewed the Eleventh Amendment as barring such award, even in suits between States and individual litigants." [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 448 U. S. 132</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/678/case.html#695">437 U. S. 695</a></span>.  Moreover, even if the Eleventh Amendment would otherwise present a barrier to an award of fees against a State, Congress was clearly acting within its power under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in removing that barrier.  Under \xc2\xa7 5, Congress may pass any legislation that is appropriate to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A statute awarding attorney\'s fees to a person who prevails on a Fourteenth Amendment claim falls within the category of "appropriate" legislation.  And clearly Congress was not limited to awarding fees only when a constitutional or civil rights claim is actually decided.  We agree with the courts below that Congress was acting within its enforcement power in allowing the award of fees in a case in which the plaintiff prevails on a wholly statutory, non-civil-rights claim pendent to a substantial constitutional claim or in one in which both a statutory and a substantial constitutional claim are settled favorably to the plaintiff without adjudication. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  As </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 448 U. S. 133</a></p><p> the Court of Appals pointed out, such  fee award</p>\n<p>"furthers the Congressional goal of encouraging suits to vindicate constitutional rights without undermining the longstanding judicial policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of important constitutional issues."</p>\n<p>594 F.2d at 342.  It is thus an appropriate means of enforcing substantive rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Civil Rights Attorney\'s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, provides:</p>\n<p>"In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981 of the Revised Statutes, title IX of Public Law 92-318, or in any civil action or proceeding, by or on behalf of the United States of America, to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\'s fee as part of the costs."</p>\n<p>This statute is codified in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988; in the codification \xc2\xa7 1979 of the Revised Statutes has been renumbered to refer to \xc2\xa7 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The action was filed against petitioner\'s predecessor in office, Nicholas Norton, Commissioner of Welfare of the State of Connecticut.

App. 76.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The court rejected petitioner\'s constitutional claim on two grounds.  First, it held that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to an award of attorney\'s fees because such fees are ancillary to the imposition of prospective relief within the reasoning of <em>Edelman v. Jordan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/case.html">415 U. S. 651</a></span>.  Second, the court held that, even if the Eleventh Amendment did apply, Congress had the power to authorize the assessment of fees in a case such as this under the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>\n<p>"The State contends, however, that Congress\' power under the Fourteenth Amendment to override state sovereign immunity extends only to suits in which a party prevails on a <em>constitutional</em> claim.  On this view, Congress cannot validly authorize a fee award against a state in the absence of a judicial determination that plaintiff had a meritorious constitutional claim.  We disagree.  We think it is within Congress\' Fourteenth Amendment power to authorize a fee award when a party prevails on a statutory claim as long as the pendent constitutional claim is a substantial one and arises out of the same operative facts.  Such a fee award furthers the Congressional goal of encouraging suits to vindicate constitutional rights without undermining the longstanding judicial policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of important constitutional issues.  As we understand the Supreme Court decisions, any appropriate means of implementing the Fourteenth Amendment overrides the State\'s Eleventh Amendment rights, <em>see, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/427/445/case.html#453">427 U.

Lavine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html">415 U. S. 528</a></span>.  Under these circumstances, petitioner could not have prevailed on his statutory argument even if the Court had reached the opposite result in <em>Thiboutot.</em> <em>See</em> <a href="#F15" name="T15">n</a> 15, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The jurisdictional statute at issue in <em>Chapman,</em> 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, specifically limits district court jurisdiction to cases in which the plaintiff alleges a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or by a federal statute "providing for equal rights" or "civil rights."  Inasmuch as it does not create substantive rights at all, but merely provides a remedy for the violation of rights conferred by the Constitution or other statutes, \xc2\xa7 1983 does not fall within the category of statutes providing for equal rights or civil rights.  Therefore, there is not automatically federal jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343 whenever a plaintiff files a \xc2\xa7 1983 claim; rather, the court must look to the underlying substantive right that was allegedly violated to determine whether that right was conferred by the Constitution or by a civil rights statute.</p>\n<p>Section 1988 does not contain language like that in \xc2\xa7 1343.  Rather, \xc2\xa7 1988 provides that attorney\'s fees may be awarded to the prevailing party "[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce [\xc2\xa7  1983]."  Although the reference to actions "to enforce" \xc2\xa7 1983 is somewhat imprecise in light of the fact that \xc2\xa7 1983 does not itself create substantive rights, the legislative history makes it perfectly clear that the Act was intended to apply in any action for which \xc2\xa7 1983 provides a remedy.  <em>See Maine v.

In his view, Congress must enact express statutory language making the States liable if it wishes to abrogate their immunity.  The Attorney General points out that this Court has sometimes refused to impose retroactive liability on the States in the absence of an extraordinarily explicit statutory mandate.  <em>See Employees v. Missouri Public Health &amp; Welfare Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/411/279/case.html">411 U. S. 279</a></span>; <em>see also Edelman v.

But these cases concern retroactive liability for prelitigation conduct, rather than expenses incurred in litigation seeking only prospective relief."</p>\n<p>"The Act imposes attorney\'s fees \'as part of the costs.\'  Costs have traditionally been awarded without regard for the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The practice of awarding costs against the States goes back to 1849 in this Court.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/us/48/660/case.html">Missouri v.

S. 70</a></span>, the State challenged this Court\'s award of costs, but we squarely rejected the State\'s claim of immunity.  Far from requiring an explicit abrogation of state immunity, we relied on a statutory mandate that was entirely silent on the question of state liability.  The power to make the award was supported by \'the inherent authority of the Court in the orderly administration of justice as between all parties litigant.\'  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/275/70/case.html#74">275 U.

For it would be absurd to require an express reference to state litigants whenever a filing fee, or a new item, such as an expert witness\' fees, is added to the category of taxable costs."</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/678/case.html#695">437 U.

The Report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 15460, a bill substantially identical to the Senate bill that was finally enacted, stated:</p>\n<p>"To the extent a plaintiff joins a claim under one of the statutes enumerated in H.R. 15460 with a claim that does not allow attorney fees, that plaintiff, if it prevails on the non-fee claim, is entitled to a determination on the other claim for the purpose of awarding counsel fees.  <em>Morales v. Haines,</em> 486 F.2d 880 (7th Cir.1973).  In some instances, however, the claim with fees may involve a constitutional question which the courts are reluctant to resolve if the nonconstitutional claim is dispositive.  <em>Hagans v.

The prisoners\' claim in <em>Hutto</em> was therefore arguably more analogous to the statutory claim involved in this case than to the constitutional claims asserted here or to the equal protection claim asserted in <em>Fitzpatrick v.

I agree with this conclusion.  Consequently, I see no reason to reach out, as the Court does in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/122/case.html#128">448 U.

That decision holds that plaintiffs may win attorney\'s fees under \xc2\xa7 1988 when they bring an action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 without any constitutional claim whatever.  For the reasons given in my dissenting opinion in <em>Thiboutot,</em> I believe that decision seriously misconceives the congressional purpose behind \xc2\xa7 1983.  In this case, however, the complaint included a substantial constitutional claim which "remained in the case until the entire dispute was settled by the entry of a consent decree."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/122/case.html#131">448 U.
