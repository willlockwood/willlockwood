In December, 1861, the master chartered her to the Quartermaster\'s Department for two hundred dollars a day.  She remained in the service of the Quartermaster till January 29, 1862, when she was delivered to the navy, by whom she was used as a transport till March 1, 1862.  She was then sent to New York and libeled as prize.  A decree of restitution was made June 20, 1863.  Proceedings to fix the amount of demurrage were stayed to enable the matter to be adjusted diplomatically.  In 1870, the Department of State informed the Spanish Minister that it would be more satisfactory to the United States to have the question settled by the court.  A reference to a commissioner resulted in a decree for demurrage to the date of the decree for restoration, in all 263 days.  On appeal, the decree was set aside as excessive and the case remanded.  Under a new reference, the same demurrage was allowed, and decree therefor made.</p>\n<p><em>Held</em> that:</p>\n<p>1.

The capture being made by the army, the vessel was not subject to condemnation as prize.</p>\n<p>3. The executive could, without legislative authority, submit to the determination of a judicial tribunal the question of the amount of damages for the capture.</p>\n<p>4. A captor who does not institute judicial proceedings for the condemnation of his prize without unnecessary delay is subject to demurrage in case a decree of restitution is made after proceedings are begun.</p>\n<p>5. The United States are liable to demurrage in the present case from the date when the surrender for adjudication might have been made until the date of the surrender at the rate fixed by the charter party.</p>\n<p>The steamer <em>Nuestra Senora de Regla</em> was built in New York for the claimant, a railroad company in Cuba created by the laws of Spain.  She was delivered to an agent of the claimant on the fifth of November, 1861, and sailed for Havana in command of a Spanish master.  She was a side-wheel steamer of about three hundred tons burden, built to run on a ferry </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 108 U.

On her way down the coast, she went into Port Royal, and while there the Quartermaster of the United States at that post offered to purchase her for the use of the government.  The master declined to sell, as he had no authority.  She was then, on the 29th of November, seized by order of General Thomas W. Sherman, in command of the United States forces.  In communicating the fact of the seizure to the adjutant general of the army on the second of December, the general said:</p>\n<p>"If this steamer I have seized is confiscated, she should be left here.  She is just the thing we want, and admirably adapted for these waters and our purpose.  She is new, and exactly such a boat as they have at the Jersey City ferry in New York.

On the 22d of July, 1873, after the mandate was filed, a second reference was made to the commissioner</p>\n<p>"to assess the damages of the claimant of the vessel sustained by him in consequence of the seizure and detention of the vessel, and that on such reference, all the proofs already taken in the cause or before the referee be used, together with such other proofs as may be put in by either party."</p>\n<p>Under this reference, the commissioner again reported that the United States continued to use the vessel after she was taken </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 108 U. S. 98</a></p><p> possession of by the Navy Department pursuant to the order of August 22, 1862, until the 20th of June, 1863, the date of the decree for her restoration, and that she had never been restored to the owners, or her value paid.

From that decree this appeal was taken </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 108 U. S. 101</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The facts to be considered on this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p>That the steamer was not lawful prize or the subject of capture was expressly decided on the former appeal.  It was also impliedly settled that the capture was without probable cause, for it was said the owner was undoubtedly entitled to a fair indemnity for the losses sustained, the only difficulty being as to the amount.  These questions are therefore no longer open.  <em>Clark v. Keith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/607/case.html">106 U. S. 607</a></span>; <em>Supervisors v. Kennicott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/498/case.html#499">94 U. S. 499</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The first of the remaining questions to be considered is whether a decree can be entered against the United States for damages.  As the capture was made by the army, or by the army and navy operating together, it inured exclusively to the benefit of the United States.  There is no distribution of prize money in such a case.  <em>Porter v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/607/case.html">106 U. S. 607</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/389/case.html">The Siren,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 38.  The United States were therefore in legal effect the captors, and they came voluntarily into court to secure for themselves the benefit of what had been done.  They deliberately adopted the acts of the military and naval officers as their own, and came, as captors, to condemn their prize.  Offers to purchase the vessel were made and declined before she was seized, and soon after the seizure she was chartered and put into actual use without any attempt at securing an adjudication.  It is evident also that the capture must have been the subject of diplomatic correspondence between the government of Spain and the United States before the vessel was brought in for adjudication, because on the 6th of May, 1862, after the vessel got to New York and before the libel was filed, Mr. Seward, the then Secretary of State, wrote the district attorney for the Southern District of New York as follows:</p>\n<p>"SIR:  Noticing the arrival at New York of the Spanish steamer <em>Nuestra Senora de la Regla,</em> which was seized at Port Royal by General Sherman for an alleged illegal breach of neutrality, I now transmit the papers found on board of her, and an abstract of them which I caused to be prepared and which you may find useful. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 108 U. S. 102</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although the libel was filed on the 9th of June, 1863, and the claim was promptly put in, the adjudication was not had until June of the following year, when all further proceedings were stayed with the consent of both parties to await an adjustment of damages by the two governments.  Nothing further was done until nearly seven years afterwards, when the Secretary of State informed the Spanish government of the wish of the United States that the parties interested should apply to the court, which still retained jurisdiction, for such relief as justice demanded, and in the mode that tribunal should deem most proper and convenient.  Thereupon, on motion of the claimant, and with the consent of the United States district attorney, the reference was ordered to ascertain the damages.  Under these circumstances, we cannot but think the United States have voluntarily submitted themselves to the court at the instance of the Spanish government, and with the consent of the claimant, for the purpose of having the questions of damages growing out of the capture judicially settled according to the rules applicable to private persons in like cases.</p>\n<p>It is objected however that the executive department of the government had no power, in the absence of express legislative authority, to make such a submission.  It was the duty of the United States under the law of nations to bring all captured vessels into a prize court for adjudication.  If that had not been done in this instance, the Spanish government would have had just cause of complaint, and could have demanded reparation for the wrongs that had been done one of its subjects.  The executive department had the right to bring the suit.  In that suit it, had been determined that the capture was unlawful.  Necessarily, therefore, the question of damages to the owner of the captured vessel arose.  Since, without the consent of the United States, no judgment for damages could be rendered against them in the pending suit that could be enforced by execution, the Spanish government had the right to assume the prosecution of the claim, and it did.  Necessarily the negotiations on the part of the United States under this claim were conducted by the executive.  After long delay, no agreement was reached, and as a last resort for ending the controversy, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 108 U. S. 103</a></p><p> was determined to refer the whole matter to the court for judicial inquiry and determination.  We see no reason why this might not be done in such a case.  It is true, any judgment that may be rendered cannot be judicially enforced, but the questions to be settled are judicial in their character, and are incidents to the suit which the United States were required to bring to enforce their rights as captors.  It is too late now to insist that the case is not one of prize, because in the libel it is expressly alleged that the vessel was captured as lawful prize, and condemnation was asked on that account.  When therefore the United States, through the executive of the nation, waived their right to exemption from suit, and asked the prize court to complete the adjudication of a cause which was rightfully begun in that jurisdiction, we think the government is bound by the submission, and that it is the duty of the court to proceed to the final determination of all the questions legitimately involved.</p>\n<p>The next inquiry is as to the amount of damages.  The duty of a captor is to institute judicial proceedings for the condemnation of his prize without unnecessary delay, and if he fails in this the Court, may, in case of restitution, decree demurrage against him as damages.  This rule is well settled.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/15/1/case.html">Slocum v. Mayberry,</a></span></em> 2 Wheat. 1; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/362/case.html">The Appollon,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 362; <em>The Lively,</em> 1 Gall. 327; <em>The Corier Maritimo,</em> 1 Rob. 287.</p>\n<p>Upon the facts in this case, there can be no doubt of the propriety of such an allowance for the extraordinary detention of the vessel before she was delivered up for adjudication, especially since she was detained for the express purpose of use by the United States.  And as to the amount of the allowance, there is no opportunity for discussion.  The United States were willing and actually contracted to pay $200 a day for her use if she was not in fact lawful prize, and that is shown to have been a reasonable price for her charter at the time.  She was seized on the 29th of November, and it is fair to assume that if due diligence had been used, she might have been surrendered for adjudication by the 16th of December, when her charter began to run.  She was not actually surrendered until the 9th of June -- a delay of 175 days beyond what was necessary.  It </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 108 U. S. 104</a></p><p> is not disputed that her value at that time was $30,000.  She cost when built $50,000, and was new when captured.  As she has never been restored under the order to that effect, there can be no doubt of the liability of the United States for her value, when at their request she was delivered into their possession by the court.  It is not a matter of any importance that the certificate of deposit in the Treasury of the amount of her appraised value was not filed.  By taking the vessel on the terms imposed by the court, the United States impliedly agreed to restore her in as good condition as she was when taken, or pay her value in money.  By the surrender of the vessel for adjudication, the United States relieved themselves from any further liability for damages in the way of demurrage, and became bound for the vessel instead.</p>\n<p>The allowance for demurrage includes reasonable compensation for the pay and expenses of an agent to look after the interests of the owners up to the time of the delivery of the vessel to the Navy Department by the court.  After that, no agent was necessary.  From that time the case stood as though a sale had been made and the proceeds paid into the registry of the court.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is that damages should be allowed as follows:</p>\n<p>For unnecessary and unusual delay in proceeding to</p>\n<p>adjudication, 175 days at $200 . . . . . . . . . .    $35,000</p>\n<p>For value of vessel. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     30,000</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>In all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     65,000</p>\n<p>To which add interest at the rate of six percent per annum, from the time of the order of restitution, June 20, 1863, until the decree.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the district court is reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to enter another decree in accordance with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
