Afterwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moore\xe2\x80\x99s brother and the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that Moore had accidentally shot him.  Moore and the accomplice repeated this account to the police.  On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sentence for that offense.  He later sought postconviction relief in state court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.  He complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his confession to police in advance of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice that Moore considered before accepting the plea offer.  The court concluded the suppression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s other admissible confession to two witnesses.  Counsel gave that as his reason for not making the motion.  He added that he had advised Moore that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore could be charged with aggravated murder.  That crime was punishable by death or life in prison without parole.  These facts led the state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>.  Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective-assistance claim.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of <em>Strickland </em>and was contrary to <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U. S. 279</a>. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Moore was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth Circuit.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), federal habeas relief may not be granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state-court decision denying relief involves \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by\xe2\x80\x9d this Court.  The relevant federal law is the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland,</em> which requires a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cboth deficient performance by counsel and prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of either part of the <em>Strickland </em>rule.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept as a justification for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s action that suppression would have been futile in light of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s other admissible confession to two witnesses.  This explanation confirms that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation was adequate under <em>Strickland, </em>so it is unnecessary to consider the reasonableness of his other justification\xe2\x80\x94that a suppression motion would have failed.  Plea bargains involve complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty, and defense counsel must make strategic choices in balancing opportunities\xe2\x80\x94pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a lesser sentence\xe2\x80\x94and risks\xe2\x80\x94that the plea bargain might come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not stronger.  Failure to respect the latitude <em>Strickland </em>requires can create at least two problems.  First, the potential for distortions and imbalance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too real; and habeas courts must be mindful of their limited role, to assess deficiency in light of information then available to counsel.  Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may      bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect because prosecutors must have assurances that a plea will not be undone in court years later.  In applying and defining the <em>Strickland</em> standard\xe2\x80\x94reasonable competence in representing the accused\xe2\x80\x94substantial deference must be accorded to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  The absence of a developed and extensive record and well-defined prosecution or defense case creates a particular risk at the early plea stage.  Here, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s prospects at trial were anything but certain.  Counsel knew that the two witnesses presented a serious strategic concern and that delaying the plea for further proceedings might allow the State to uncover additional incriminating evidence in support of a capital prosecution.  Under these circumstances, counsel made a reasonable choice.  At the very least, the state court would not have been unreasonable to so conclude.  The Court of Appeals relied further on <em>Fulminante,</em> but a state-court adjudication of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance under the Sixth Amendment cannot be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fulminante</em>, for <em>Fulminante</em>\xe2\x80\x94which involved the admission of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94says nothing about <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>effectiveness standard.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The state court also reasonably could have concluded that Moore was not prejudiced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  To prevail in state court, he had to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a>, 59.  Deference to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice determination is significant, given the uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations.  That court reasonably could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s case was already formidable with two witnesses to an admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the investigation continued.  Moore also faced the possibility of grave punishments.  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the confession may have been essential to securing that agreement.  Again, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding could not be contrary to <em>Fulminante</em>, which does not speak to <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice standard or contemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.  To the extent <em>Fulminante</em>\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice determination was reasonable.

Here, as in <em>Richter</em>, the Court reviews a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting federal habeas corpus relief in a challenge to a state criminal conviction.  Here, too, the case turns on the proper implementation of one of the stated premises for issuance of federal habeas corpus contained in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), the instruction that federal habeas corpus relief may not be granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision denying relief involves \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, as in <em>Richter</em>, the relevant clearly established law derives from <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), which provides the standard for inadequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.  <em>Richter</em> involves a California conviction and addresses the adequacy of representation when counsel did not consult or use certain experts in pretrial preparation and at trial.  The instant case involves an unrelated Oregon conviction and concerns the adequacy of representation in providing an assessment of a plea bargain without first seeking suppression of a confession assumed to have been improperly obtained.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 7, 1995, respondent Randy Moore and two confederates attacked Kenneth Rogers at his home and bloodied him before tying him with duct tape and throwing him in the trunk of a car.  They drove into the Oregon countryside, where Moore shot Rogers in the temple, killing him.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Afterwards, Moore and one of his accomplices told two people\xe2\x80\x94Moore\xe2\x80\x99s brother and the accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend\xe2\x80\x94about the crimes.  According to Moore\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Moore and his accomplice admitted:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o make an example and put some scare into Mr. Rogers \xe2\x80\xa6, they had blind-folded him [and] duct taped him and put him in the trunk of the car and took him out to a place that\xe2\x80\x99s a little remote \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [T]heir intent was to leave him there and make him walk home \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0  [Moore] had taken the revolver from Lonnie and at the time he had taken it, Mr. Rogers had slipped backwards on the mud and the gun discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 157\xe2\x80\x93158.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore and his accomplice repeated this account to the police.  On the advice of counsel Moore agreed to plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for a sentence of 300 months, the minimum sentence allowed by law for the offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore later filed for postconviction relief in an Oregon state court, alleging that he had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel.  He complained that his lawyer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to police in advance of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice that Moore considered before accepting the plea offer.  After an evidentiary hearing, the Oregon court concluded a \xe2\x80\x9cmotion to suppress would have been fruitless\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the other admissible confession by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify.  <em>Id</em>., at 140.  As the court noted, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s trial counsel explained why he did not move to exclude Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to police:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Moore and I discussed the possibility of filing a Motion to Suppress and concluded that it would be unavailing, because . . . he had previously made a full confession to his brother and to [his accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend], either one of whom could have been called as a witness at any time to repeat his confession in full detail.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jordan Affidavit (Feb. 26, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 70, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p align="left">\nCounsel added that he had made Moore aware of the possibility of being charged with aggravated murder, which carried a potential death sentence, as well as the possibility of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.  See Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7163.105(1)(a) (1995).  The intense and serious abuse to the victim before the shooting might well have led the State to insist on a strong response.  In light of these facts the Oregon court concluded Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, renewing his ineffective-assistance claim.  The District Court denied the petition, finding sufficient evidence to support the Oregon court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that suppression would not have made a difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  <em>Moore</em> v. <em>Czerniak</em>, 574 F.\xc2\xa03d 1092 (2009).  In its view the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s action did not constitute ineffective assistance was an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of <em>Strickland </em>and was contrary to \n<em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/279/index.html">499 U.

The applicable federal law consists of the rules for determining when a criminal defendant has received inadequate representation as defined in <em>Strickland</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To establish ineffective assistance of counsel \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant must show both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).  In addressing this standard and its relationship to AEDPA, the Court today in <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316, gives the following explanation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo establish deficient performance, a person challenging a conviction must show that \xe2\x80\x98counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of rea-sonableness.\xe2\x80\x99 [<em>Strickland</em>,] 466 U. S.,<em> </em>at 688.  A court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must \napply a \xe2\x80\x98strong presumption\xe2\x80\x99 that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation was within the \xe2\x80\x98wide range\xe2\x80\x99 of reasonable professional assistance. <em> Id.,</em> at 689.  The challenger\xe2\x80\x99s burden is to show \xe2\x80\x98that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x9d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Id.</em>, at 687.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to prejudice, a challenger must \ndemonstrate \xe2\x80\x98a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the \nproceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Surmounting <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s high bar is never an easy task.\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Padilla</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14).  An ineffective-assistance claim can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial [or in pretrial proceedings], and so the <em>Strickland</em> standard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest \xe2\x80\x98intrusive post-trial inquiry\xe2\x80\x99 threaten the integrity of the very adversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 689\xe2\x80\x93690.  Even under <em>de novo</em> review, the standard for judging counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation is a most deferential one.  Unlike a later reviewing court, the attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of materials outside the record, and interacted with the client, with opposing counsel, and with the judge.  It is \xe2\x80\x98all too tempting\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98second-guess counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.\xe2\x80\x99 <em> Id.</em>, at 689; see also <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/685/index.html">535 U.

The question is whether an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s representation amounted to incompetence under \xe2\x80\x98prevailing professional norms,\xe2\x80\x99 not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 690.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEstablishing that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Strickland</em> was unreasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d) is all the more difficult.  The standards created by <em>Strickland</em> and \xc2\xa72254(d) are both \xe2\x80\x98highly deferential,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>id.</em>, at 689; <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U.

The <em>Strickland </em>standard is a general one, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial.  556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under <em>Strickland</em> with unreasonableness under \xc2\xa72254(d).  When \xc2\xa72254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s actions were reasonable.  The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question becomes whether Moore\xe2\x80\x99s counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to police before advising Moore regarding the plea.  Finding that any \xe2\x80\x9cmotion to suppress would have been fruitless,\xe2\x80\x9d the state postconviction court concluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance of counsel.  App. 140.  The state court did not specify whether this was because there was no deficient performance under <em>Strickland </em>or<em> </em>because Moore suffered no <em>Strickland </em>prejudice, or both.  To overcome the limitation imposed by \xc2\xa7 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to conclude that both findings would have involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.  See <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  In finding that this standard was met, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of either part of the <em>Strickland </em>rule.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant deference to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude it would have been unreasonable to find that the defense attorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes.  <em>Knowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 (slip op., at 11); <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 687.  Counsel gave this explanation for his decision to discuss the plea bargain without first challenging Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to the police: that suppression would serve little purpose in light of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s other full and admissible confession, to which both his brother and his accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend could testify.  The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any motion to suppress was likely to fail.  Reviewing the reasonableness of that justification is complicated by the possibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that would have supported its position: The Court of Appeals assumed that a motion would have succeeded because the warden did not argue otherwise.  Of course that is not the same as a concession that no competent attorney would think a motion to suppress would have failed, which is the relevant question under <em>Strickland</em>.  See <em>Kimmelman</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/365/index.html">477 U. S. 365</a>, 382 (1986); <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  It is unnecessary to consider whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s second justification was reasonable, however, since the first and independent explanation\xe2\x80\x94that suppression would have been futile\xe2\x80\x94confirms that his representation was adequate under <em>Strickland</em>, or at least that it would \nhave been reasonable for the state court to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an early plea respond to certain basic premises in the law and its function.  Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is too easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not apparent to a competent attorney when actions and advice leading to the plea took place.  Plea bargains are the result of complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty, and defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices in balancing opportunities and risks.  The opportunities, of course, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a lesser sentence, as compared with what might be the outcome not only at trial but also from a later plea offer if the case grows stronger and prosecutors find stiffened resolve.  A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the chance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea bargain might come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not stronger.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s case can begin to fall apart as stories change, witnesses become unavailable, and new suspects are identified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations make strict adherence to the <em>Strickland </em>standard all the more essential when reviewing the choices an attorney made at the plea bargain stage.  Failure to respect the latitude <em>Strickland</em> requires can create at least two problems in the plea context.  First, the potential for the distortions and imbalance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too real.  The art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and it presents questions farther removed from immediate judicial supervision.  There are, moreover, special difficulties in evaluating the basis for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment: An attorney often has insights borne of past dealings with the same prosecutor or court, and the record at the pretrial stage is never as full as it is after a trial.  In determining how searching and exacting their review must be, habeas courts must respect their limited role \nin determining whether there was manifest deficiency in light of information then available to counsel.  <em>Lockhart</em> v. <em>Fretwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/364/index.html"></a><a href="/us/506/364/index.html">506 U. S. 364</a>, 372 (1993). AEDPA compounds the imperative of judicial caution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect.  <em>Strickland </em>allows a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cto escape rules of waiver and forfeiture,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 15. Prosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone years later because of infidelity to the requirements of AEDPA and the teachings of <em>Strickland</em>.  The prospect that a plea deal will afterwards be unraveled when a court second-guesses counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decisions while failing to accord the latitude <em>Strickland</em> mandates or disregarding the structure dictated by AEDPA could lead prosecutors to forgo plea bargains that would benefit defendants, a result favorable to no one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether before, during, or after trial, when the Sixth Amendment applies, the formulation of the standard is the same: reasonable competence in representing the accused.  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 688.  In applying and defining this standard substantial deference must be accorded to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 689.  But at different stages of the case that deference may be measured in different ways. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case of an early plea, neither the prosecution nor the defense may know with much certainty what course the case may take. It follows that each side, of necessity, risks consequences that may arise from contingencies or circumstances yet unperceived.  The absence of a developed or an extensive record and the circumstance that neither the prosecution nor the defense case has been well defined create a particular risk that an after-the-fact assessment will run counter to the deference that must be accorded counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and perspective when the plea was negotiated, offered, and entered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors in the present case faced the cost of litigation and the risk of trying their case without Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to the police.  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s counsel could reasonably believe that a swift plea bargain would allow Moore to take advantage of the State\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to these hazards.  And whenever cases involve multiple defendants, there is a chance that prosecutors might convince one defendant \nto testify against another in exchange for a better deal.  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s plea eliminated that possibility and ended an ongoing investigation.  Delaying the plea for further proceedings would have given the State time to uncover additional incriminating evidence that could have formed the basis of a capital prosecution.  It must be remem-bered, after all, that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it was an accident when he shot the victim through the temple might be disbelieved.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not clear how the successful exclusion of the confession would have affected counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic calculus.  The prosecution had at its disposal two witnesses able to relate another confession.  True, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s brother and the girlfriend of his accomplice might have changed their accounts in a manner favorable to Moore.  But the record before the state court reveals no reason to believe that either witness would violate the legal obligation to convey the content of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession.  And to the extent that his accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend had an ongoing interest in the matter, she might have been tempted to put more blame, not less, on Moore.  Then, too, the accomplices themselves might have decided to implicate Moore to a greater extent than his own confession did, say by indicating that Moore shot the victim deliberately, not accidentally.  All these possibilities are speculative.  What counsel knew at the time was that the existence of the two witnesses to an additional confession posed a serious strategic concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore\xe2\x80\x99s prospects at trial were thus anything but certain.  Even now, he does not deny any involvement in the kidnaping and killing.  In these circumstances, and with a potential capital charge lurking, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s counsel made a reasonable choice to opt for a quick plea bargain.  At the very least, the state court would not have been unreasonable to so conclude.  Cf. <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U. S. 652</a>, 664 (2004) (explaining that state courts enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cmore leeway\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA in applying general standards).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 contrary holding rests on a case that did not involve ineffective assistance of counsel:  <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/279/index.html">499 U. S. 279</a> (1991).  To reach that result, it transposed that case into a novel context; and novelty alone\xe2\x80\x94at least insofar as it renders the relevant rule less than \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94provides a reason to reject it under AEDPA.  See <em>Yarborough</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 666 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeas courts introduced rules not clearly established under the guise of extensions to existing law\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6[, although c]ertain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the transposition is improper even on its own terms.  According to the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Fulminante</em> stands for the proposition that the admission of an additional confession ordinarily reinforces and corroborates the others and is therefore prejudicial.\xe2\x80\x9d  574 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1111.  Based on that reading, the Court of Appeals held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to <em>Fulminante</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1102.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But <em>Fulminante</em> may not be so incorporated into the <em>Strickland</em> performance inquiry.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A state-court adjudication of the performance of coun-\nsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fulminante</em>, for <em>Fulminante</em>\xe2\x80\x94which involved the admission of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94says nothing about the <em>Strickland </em>standard of effectiveness.  See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/685/index.html">535 U. S. 685</a>, 694 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cA federal habeas court may issue the writ under the \xe2\x80\x98contrary to\xe2\x80\x99 clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in our cases, or if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The <em>Fulminante </em>prejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation, whereas <em>Strickland</em> seeks to define one.  The state court accepted counsel\xe2\x80\x99s view that seeking to suppress Moore\xe2\x80\x99s second confession would have been \xe2\x80\x9cfruitless.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would not have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could incorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a subject with which <em>Fulminante</em> is in no way concerned.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A finding of constitutionally adequate performance under <em>Strickland</em> cannot be contrary to <em>Fulminante</em>.  The state court likely reached the correct result under <em>Strickland</em>.  And under \xc2\xa72254(d), that it reached a reasonable one is sufficient.  See <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at\xc2\xa019.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would have been unreasonable for the state postconviction court to have found no prejudice in counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to suppress Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to police.  To prevail on prejudice before the state court Moore had to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a>, 59 (1985).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deference to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice determination is all the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations described above: The stakes for defendants are high, and many elect to limit risk by forgoing the right to assert their innocence.  A defendant who accepts a plea bargain on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s advice does not necessarily suffer prejudice when his counsel fails to seek suppression of evidence, even if it would be reversible error for the court to admit that evidence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court here reasonably could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.  By the time the plea agreement cut short investigation of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s crimes, the State\xe2\x80\x99s case was already formidable and included two witnesses to an admissible confession.  Had the prosecution continued to investigate, its case might well have become stronger.  At the same time, Moore faced grave punishments.  His decision to plead no contest allowed him to avoid a possible sentence of life without parole or death.  The bargain counsel struck was thus a favorable one\xe2\x80\x94the statutory minimum for the charged offense\xe2\x80\x94and the decision to forgo a challenge to the confession may have been essential to securing that agreement.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once again the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by pointing to <em>Fulminante:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cThe state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that a motion to suppress a recorded confession to the police would have been \xe2\x80\x98fruitless\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 was without question contrary to clearly established federal law as set forth in <em>Fulminante</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  574 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1112.  And again there is no sense in which the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding could be contrary to <em>Fulminante</em>, for <em>Fulminante </em>says nothing about prejudice for <em>Strickland</em> purposes, nor does it contemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.  </p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court of Appeals appears to have treated <em>Fulminante</em> as a <em>per se</em> rule of prejudice, or something close to \nit, in all cases involving suppressible confessions.  It is \nnot.  In <em>Fulminante </em>five Justices made the uncontroversial observation that many confessions are powerful evidence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 499 U. S., at 296.  <em>Fulminante</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice analysis arose on direct review following an acknowledged constitutional error at trial.  The State therefore had the burden of showing that it was \xe2\x80\x9cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1999) (paraphrasing <em>Fulminante</em>, <em>supra</em>).  That standard cannot apply to determinations of whether inadequate assistance of counsel prejudiced a defendant who entered into a plea agreement.  Many defendants reasonably enter plea agreements even though there is a significant probability\xe2\x80\x94much more than a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94that they would be acquitted if they proceeded to trial.  Thus, the question in the present case is not whether Moore was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that he would still be convicted if the extra confession were suppressed.  It is whether Moore established the reasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency, <em>Hill</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 59, and more to the point, whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the contrary would be unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the extent <em>Fulminante</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application of the harmless-error standard sheds any light on the present case, it suggests that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice determination was reasonable.  <em>Fulminante</em> found<em> </em>that an improperly admitted confession was not harmless under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/index.html">386 U. S. 18</a> (1967) because the remaining evidence against the defendant was weak.  The additional evidence consisted primarily of a second confession that Fulminante had made to the informant\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e.  But many of its details were not corroborated, the fianc\xc3\xa9e had not reported the confession for a long period of time, the State had indicated that both confessions were essential to its case, and the fianc\xc3\xa9e potentially \xe2\x80\x9chad a motive to lie.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 300.  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s plea agreement, by contrast, ended the government\xe2\x80\x99s investigation well before trial, yet the evidence against Moore was strong.  The accounts of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s second confession to his brother and his accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend corroborated each other, were given to people without apparent reason to lie, and were reported without delay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State gave no indication that its felony-murder prosecution depended on the admission of the police confession, and Moore does not now deny that he kidnaped and killed Rogers.  Given all this, an unconstitutional admission of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s confession to police might well have been found harmless even on direct review if Moore had gone to trial after the denial of a suppression motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other than for its discussion of the basic proposition that a confession is often powerful evidence, <em>Fulminante </em>is not relevant to the present case.  The state postconviction court reasonably could have concluded that Moore was \nnot prejudiced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  Under AEDPA, that finding ends federal review.  See <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Berzon\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals does not provide a basis for issuance of the writ.  The concurring opinion would have found the state court\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice determination unreasonable in light of <em>Kimmelman</em>.  It relied on <em>Kimmelman </em>to find that Moore suffered prejudice for <em>Strickland</em> purposes because there was \na reasonable possibility that he would have obtained a better plea agreement but for his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors.  But <em>Kimmelman</em> concerned a conviction following a bench trial, so it did not establish, much less clearly establish, the appropriate standard for prejudice in cases involving plea bargains.  See 477 U. S., at 389.  That standard was established in <em>Hill</em>, which held that a defendant who enters a plea agreement must show \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U. S., at 59.  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make that showing forecloses relief under AEDPA.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are certain differences between inadequate assistance of counsel claims in cases where there was a full trial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea was entered even before the prosecution decided upon all of the charges.  A trial provides the full written record and factual background that serve to limit and clarify some of the choices counsel made.  Still, hindsight cannot suffice for relief when counsel\xe2\x80\x99s choices were reasonable and legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would proceed.  See <em>Richter</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 18.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate, and often more so, where a plea has been entered without a full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution decided on the charges.  The added uncertainty that results when there is no extended, formal record and no actual history to show how the charges have played out at trial works against the party alleging inadequate assistance.  Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty.  There is a most substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffective assistance.  The plea process brings to the criminal justice system a stability and a certainty that must not be undermined by the prospect of collateral challenges in cases not only where witnesses and evidence have disappeared, but also in cases where witnesses and evidence were not presented in the first place.  The substantial burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel, the burden the claimant must meet to avoid the plea, has not been met in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s decision involved no unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.  Because the Court of Appeals erred in finding otherwise, its judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan</em> took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963446">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n562 U.
