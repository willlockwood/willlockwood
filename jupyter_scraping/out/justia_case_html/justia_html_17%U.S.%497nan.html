The original Spanish owner and the prize master from the Carthagenian cruiser both claimed the goods.  The possession was decreed to be restored to the Carthagenian prize master.</p>\n<p>War having been recognized to exist between Spain and her colonies by the government of the United States, it is the duty of the courts of the United States, where a capture is made by either of the belligerent parties without any violation of our neutrality and the captured prize is brought innocently within our jurisdiction, to leave things in the same state they find them or to restore them to the state from which they have been forcibly removed by the act of our own citizens.</p>\n<p>The Spanish treaty <em>held</em> not to apply to the above case, as the Court could not consider the Carthagenian captors as pirates and the capture was not made within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, the only two cases in which the treaty enjoins restitution.</p>\n<p>This was a prize allegation against certain goods, taken by a private armed vessel of the United States, the <em>Harrison,</em> during the late war with Great Britain, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 17 U.

That having separated from the capturing vessel, they were met with and boarded by the privateer <em>Harrison.</em>  That the said privateer captured and took possession of the <em>Caridad,</em> and the captors unladed the cargo from on board of her into the <em>Harrison,</em> and having brought the same into the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, proceeded against it as prize of war.</p>\n<p>A cross-claim was filed by Pedro Brugman, master and commander of the Carthagenian armed schooner <em>Neustra Senora de la Popa,</em> in behalf of himself and others, the owners of said privateer, to the goods thus proceeded against as prize of war, by the commander, officers and crew of the <em>Harrison.</em>  This claim pleaded that the goods were not, at the time of the proceedings, nor at the time of capture by the <em>Harrison,</em> the property of any British subjects, or of any persons domiciled in the dominions of Great Britain, nor of any of the enemies of the United States, but that the same then were, and yet are, the property of the owners, officers and crew of the <em>La Popa,</em> from whose lawful possession the same </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 17 U.

That the <em>La Popa,</em> having been duly commissioned by the sovereign authority of the independent State of Carthagena, and furnished with letters of marque and reprisal authorizing her to capture on the high seas, the property of the enemies of said state, left the port of Carthagena in the month of December, 1814, on a cruise.  That on 21 of January, 1815, while cruising off St. Iago de Cuba, the said privateer <em>La Popa,</em> commanded by the claimant, seized and captured the ship <em>La Caridad,</em> sailing from Jamaica to Cuba, loaded with drygoods, and belonging, with the cargo, to the enemies of the said independent State of Carthagena, as the papers on board, and the information of the master and crew, convinced the claimant to be the fact.  That the claimant put a prize master and crew on board the captured vessel, and ordered her to proceed to the said port of Carthagena.  That the said prize master and crew retained the possession for four days, and while they were proceeding to Carthagena, the <em>Caridad</em> was forcibly taken by the <em>Harrison</em> from their possession, the goods taken out, and brought into the port of Wilmington as aforesaid.</p>\n<p>An order was made by the court below that the claimant, Pedro Brugman, should be allowed to make further proof that the commission which he produced and under which he alleged the original capture to have been made was issued by the authority acting as the sovereign authority of the United Provinces of New Grenada. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 17 U.

S. 501</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case arose out of a capture made in the late war.  The <em>La Popa,</em> a commissioned cruiser of the Province of Carthagena, had made prize of the <em>Caridad,</em> a Spanish vessel, in a voyage from Jamaica to Cuba.  The American private armed vessel <em>Harrison</em> fell in with the <em>Caridad,</em> then in possession of the prize crew of the <em>La Popa,</em> and suspecting her cargo to be British, took possession of it and transshipped it into their own vessel.  On the arrival of the <em>Harrison</em> in a port of North Carolina, the cargo was claimed both by the <em>Caridad</em> and <em>La Popa,</em> and finally restored to the <em>La Popa.</em>  This is an appeal from the decision of the circuit Court of North Carolina, made by the original Spanish owner, and the case has been submitted on the evidence and the grounds, taken in the argument below.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the property was Spanish, nor that the privateer <em>La Popa</em> was commissioned as a cruiser, whilst the Province of Carthagena had an organized government; and there is the fullest evidence, that her armament and equipment was unaffected by any charge of having been made in violation of our laws.  The only question in the case is whether an original Spanish owner is entitled to the aid of the courts of this country to restore to him property of which he has been dispossessed by capture, under a commission derived from the revolted colonies? and this question is considered by this Court as having </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 17 U. S. 502</a></p><p> been fully decided by the principles assumed in the case of the <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/16/610/case.html">United States v. Palmer,</a></span></em> at the last term, 3 Wheat. 610, and by the decisions in the cases of <em>The Estrella, ante,</em> &lt;|17 U.S. 298|&gt;298, and <em>The Divina Pastora, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/52/case.html">17 U. S. 52</a></span>, at the present term.</p>\n<p>War notoriously exists, and is recognized by our government to exist between Spain and her colonies.  This is an appeal to the highest of all tribunals on a question of right.  No neutral nation can act against either, without taking part with the other in the war.  All that the law of nations requires of us is strict and impartial neutrality.  And no friendly nation ought to demand of the courts of this country to do an act which may involve it in a war with the victor.  Our duty is, where the property of either is brought innocently within our jurisdiction, to leave things as we find them; much more, to restore them to that state from which they have been forcibly removed by the act of our own citizens. The treaty with Spain can have no bearing upon the case, as this Court cannot recognize such captors as pirates, and the capture was not made within our jurisdictional limits.  In those two cases only does the treaty enjoin restitution.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
