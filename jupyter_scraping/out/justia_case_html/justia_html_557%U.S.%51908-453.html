Respondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC) and a banking trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming that the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation promulgated under the National Bank Act (NBA) prohibits that form of state law enforcement against national banks.  The District Court entered an injunction prohibiting the Attorney General from enforcing state fair-lending laws through demands for records or judicial proceedings.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation purporting to pre-empt state law enforcement is not a reasonable interpretation of the NBA.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a).  Among other things, the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation implementing \xc2\xa7484(a) forbids States to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records,\xe2\x80\x9d or, as here pertinent, \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuting enforcement actions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4000(a)(1).  There is some ambiguity in the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the term within the bounds of that uncertainty.  <em>Chevron U.

However, the presence of some uncertainty does not expand <em>Chevron</em> deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the NBA.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College</em> v. <em>Woodward</em>, 4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681; <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>at 159, 157; <em>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/263/640/index.html">263 U. S. 640</a>, 660.  <em>Watters</em> v. <em>Wachovia Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/1/index.html">550 U. S. 1</a>, 21, distinguished.  And contrary to the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, the NBA pre-empts only the former.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iv)\xc2\xa0The regulation\xe2\x80\x99s consequences also cast its validity into doubt: Even the OCC acknowledges that the NBA leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks, yet the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s rule says that the State may not <em>enforce</em> its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>St. Louis, supra</em>, at 660.<em> </em>In contrast, channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial\xe2\x80\x9d oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to pre-empt substantive state law.  This reading is also suggested by \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers \xe2\x80\x9cvested in the courts of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  And on a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear: If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, its targets are protected by discovery and procedural rules.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the regulation demonstrates its own flaw: the Comptroller is forced to limit the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s sweep in areas such as contract enforcement and debt collection, but those exceptions rest upon neither the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s nor the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s objections are addressed and rejected.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Under the foregoing principles, the Comptroller reasonably interpreted the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d term to include \xe2\x80\x9cconducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks,\xe2\x80\x9d when the State conducts those activities as supervisor of corporations.  When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather sovereign-as-law-enforcer.  Because such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers,\xe2\x80\x9d the Comptroller erred by extending that term to include \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuting enforcement actions\xe2\x80\x9d in state courts.  In this case, the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but the issuance of subpoena on his own authority if his request for information was not voluntarily honored.  That is not the exercise of the law enforcement power \xe2\x80\x9cvested in the courts of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d which the NBA exempts from the ban on the exercise of supervisory power.  Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s threatened issuance of executive subpoenas, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.

He sought this information to determine whether the banks had violated the State\xe2\x80\x99s fair-lending laws.  Spitzer\xe2\x80\x99s successor in office, Andrew Cuomo, is the petitioner here.  Respondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\xe2\x80\x9cComptroller\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cOCC\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Clearing House Association, a banking trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming that the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation promulgated under the National Bank Act prohibits that form of state law enforcement against national banks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an injunction in favor of respondents, prohibiting the attorney general from enforcing state fair-lending laws through demands for records or judicial proceedings.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  510 F.\xc2\xa03d 105 (2007).  We granted certiorari.  555 U. S. ___ (2009).  The question presented is whether the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation purporting to pre-empt state law enforcement can be upheld as a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 484(a) of Title 12, U.

There is necessarily some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers,\xe2\x80\x9d especially since we are working in an era when the prerogative writs\xe2\x80\x94through which visitorial powers were traditionally enforced\xe2\x80\x94are not in vogue.  The Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the statute within the bounds of that uncertainty.  But the presence of some uncertainty does not expand <em>Chevron</em> deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the National Bank Act.  We can discern the outer limits of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d even through the clouded lens of history.  They do not include, as the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s expansive regulation would provide, ordinary enforcement of the law.  Evidence from the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, a long line of our own cases, and application of normal principles of construction to the National Bank Act make that clear.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historically, the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s right of visitation over corporations paralleled the right of the church to supervise its institutions and the right of the founder of a charitable institution \xe2\x80\x9cto see that [his] property [was] rightly employed,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England<em> </em>469 (1765).  By extension of this principle, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he king [was] by law the visitor of all civil corporations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>A visitor could inspect and control the visited institution at will.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the National Bank Act was enacted in 1864, \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation\xe2\x80\x9d was accordingly understood as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cthe government itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary<em> </em>790 (15th ed. 1883).  Lower courts understood \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of a superior or superintending officer, who visits a corporation to examine into its manner of conducting business, and enforce an observance of its laws and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First Nat. Bank of Youngstown </em>v. <em>Hughes</em>, 6 F. 737, 740 (CC ND Ohio 1881).  A State was the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitor\xe2\x80\x9d of all companies incorporated in the State, simply by virtue of the State\xe2\x80\x99s role as sovereign: The \xe2\x80\x9clegislature is the visitor of all corporations founded by it.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Guthrie</em> v. <em>Harkness</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/199/148/index.html">199 U. S. 148</a>, 157 (1905) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This relationship between sovereign and corporation was understood to allow the States to use prerogative writs\xe2\x80\x94such as mandamus and <em>quo warranto</em>\xe2\x80\x94to exercise control \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever a corporation [wa]s abusing the power given it, or, \xe2\x80\xa6 or acting adversely to the public, or creating a nuisance.\xe2\x80\x9d  H. Wilgus, Private Corporations, in 8 American Law and Procedure \xc2\xa7157, pp.\xc2\xa0224\xe2\x80\x93225 (1910).

Wormser, Private Corporations \xc2\xa780, pp.\xc2\xa0100, 101, in 4 Modern American Law (1921).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases have always understood \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation\xe2\x80\x9d as this right to oversee corporate affairs, quite separate from the power to enforce the law.  In the famous <em>Dartmouth College </em>case, Justice Story, describing visitation of a charitable corporation, wrote that Dartmouth was \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the controlling authority of its legal visitor, who \xe2\x80\xa6 may amend and repeal its statutes, remove its officers, correct abuses, and generally superintend the management of [its] trusts,\xe2\x80\x9d and who are \xe2\x80\x9cliable to no supervision or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College</em> v. <em>Woodward</em>, 4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681 (1819) (concurring opinion).  This power of \xe2\x80\x9cgenera[l] superintend[ence]\xe2\x80\x9d stood in contrast to action by the court of chancery, which acted \xe2\x80\x9cnot as itself possessing a visitorial power \xe2\x80\xa6 but as possessing a general jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 to redress grievances, and frauds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 676.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>we held that a shareholder acting in his role as a private individual was not exercising a \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial power\xe2\x80\x9d under the National Bank Act when he petitioned a court to force the production of corporate records, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 159.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontrol in the courts of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, is not visitorial, and we drew a contrast between the nonvisitorial act of \xe2\x80\x9csu[ing] in the courts of the State\xe2\x80\x9d and the visitorial \xe2\x80\x9csupervision of the Comptroller of the Currency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 159, 157.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/263/640/index.html">263 U. S. 640</a> (1924), we upheld the right of the Attorney General of Missouri to bring suit to enforce a state anti-bank-branching law against a national bank.  We said that only the United States may perform visitorial administrative oversight, such as \xe2\x80\x9cinquir[ing] by <em>quo warranto </em>whether a national bank is acting in excess of its charter powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 660.  But if a state statute of general applicability is not substantively pre-empted, then \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of enforcement must rest with the [State] and not with\xe2\x80\x9d the National Government, <em>ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our most recent decision, <em>Watters</em> v. <em>Wachovia Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/1/index.html">550 U.

All parties to the case agreed that Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s general oversight regime could not be imposed on national banks; the sole question was whether operating subsidiaries of national banks enjoyed the same immunity from state visitation.  The opinion addresses and answers no other question. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing cases all involve enforcement of state law.  But if the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive exercise of visitorial powers precluded law enforcement by the States, it would also preclude law enforcement by federal agencies.  Of course it does not.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>Douglas</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa02d 100, 105\xe2\x80\x93106 (CADC 1939) (Securities Exchange Commission investigation of bank fraud is not an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Peoples Bank of Danville</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, 449 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 254, 260 (WD Va. 1978) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the unmistakable and utterly consistent teaching of our jurisprudence, both before and after enactment of the National Bank Act, is that a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d and its power to enforce the law are two different things.  There is not a credible argument to the contrary.  And contrary to what the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation says, the National Bank Act pre-empts only the former.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequences of the regulation also cast doubt upon its validity.  No one denies that the National Bank Act leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks.  See Brief for Federal Respondent 20; Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C. 29; <em>post, </em>at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s rule says that the State may not <em>enforce</em> its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The bark remains, but the bite does not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent admits, with considerable understatement, that such a result is \xe2\x80\x9cunusual,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cBizarre\xe2\x80\x9d would be more apt.  As the Court said in <em>St. Louis:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 U. S., at 660.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nIn sharp contrast to the \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d reading propounded by the C</em>omptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, reading \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\xe2\x80\x94the precise result contemplated by our opinion in<em> St. Louis</em>, which said that if a state statute is valid as to national banks, \xe2\x80\x9cthe corollary that it is obligatory <em>and enforceable</em> necessarily results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 659\xe2\x80\x93660 (emphasis added).  Channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial\xe2\x80\x9d oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to pre-empt substantive state law.  This system echoes many other mixed state/federal regimes in which the Federal Government exercises general oversight while leaving state substantive law in place.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is also suggested by \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers \xe2\x80\x9cvested in the courts of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  As described earlier, visitation was normally conducted through use of the prerogative writs of mandamus and <em>quo warranto</em>.  The exception could not possibly exempt that manner of exercising visitation, or else the exception would swallow the rule.  Its only conceivable purpose is to preserve normal civil and criminal lawsuits.  To be sure, the reservation of powers \xe2\x80\x9cvested in the courts of justice\xe2\x80\x9d is phrased as an exception from the prohibition of visitorial powers.  But as we have just discussed, it cannot possibly be that, and it is explicable only as an attempt to make clear that the courts\xe2\x80\x99 ordinary powers of enforcing the law are not affected.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear.  If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, then it is not exercising its power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant.  An attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a lawsuit, survive a motion to dismiss, endure the rules of procedure and discovery, and risk sanctions if his claim is frivolous or his discovery tactics abusive.  Judges are trusted to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cfishing expeditions\xe2\x80\x9d or an undirected rummaging through bank books and records for evidence of some unknown wrongdoing.  In New York, civil discovery is far more limited than the full range of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d that may be exercised by a sovereign.  Courts may enter protective orders to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d N.\xc2\xa0Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \xc2\xa73103(a) (West 2005), and may supervise discovery <em>sua sponte</em>, \xc2\xa73104(a).  A visitor, by contrast, may inspect books and records at any time for any or no reason.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, therefore, does not comport with the statute.  Neither does the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s <em>interpretation </em>of its regulation, which differs from the text and must be discussed separately.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evidently realizing that exclusion of state enforcement of <em>all </em>state laws against national banks is too extreme to be contemplated, the Comptroller sought to limit the sweep of its regulation by the following passage set forth in the agency\xe2\x80\x99s statement of basis and purpose in the Federal Register:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the case law <em>does </em>recognize is that \xe2\x80\x98states retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts, debt collection, acquisition and transfer of property, and taxation, zoning, criminal, and tort law.\xe2\x80\x99  [citing a Ninth Circuit case.]  Application of these laws to national banks and their implementation by state authorities typically does not affect the content or extent of the Federally-authorized business of banking . . . but rather establishes the legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks \xe2\x80\xa6 to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d  69 Fed. Reg. 1896 (2004) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This cannot be reconciled with the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s almost categorical prohibition in 12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4000(a)(1) of \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuting enforcement actions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Nor can it be justified by the provision in subsection (a)(2)(iv) which defines visitorial powers to include \xe2\x80\x9c[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable \xe2\x80\xa6 state laws concerning\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cactivities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77.4000(a)(2)(iii).  The latter phrase cannot be interpreted to include only distinctively banking activities (leaving the States free to enforce nonbanking state laws), because if it were so interpreted subsection (a)(2)(iii), which uses the same terminology,  would limit the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive visitorial power of \xe2\x80\x9cregulation and supervision\xe2\x80\x9d to distinctively banking activities\xe2\x80\x94which no one thinks is the case.  Anyway, the National Bank Act <em>does </em>specifically authorize and permit activities that fall within what the statement of basis and purpose calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks \xe2\x80\xa6 to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724 Third (power to make contracts); \xc2\xa724 Seventh (\xe2\x80\x9call such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\xe2\x80\x9d).  And of course a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cinfrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d and judicial enforcement of other laws can be found nowhere<em> </em>within the text of the statute.  This passage in the statement of basis and purpose, resting upon neither the text of the regulation nor the text of the statute, attempts to do what Congress declined to do: exempt national banks from all state banking laws, or at least state enforcement of those laws.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent fails to persuade us.  Its fundamental contention\xe2\x80\x94that the exclusive grant of visitorial powers can be interpreted to preclude state enforcement of state laws\xe2\x80\x94rests upon a logical fallacy.  The dissent establishes, <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (and we do not at all contest), that in the course of exercising visitation powers the sovereign can compel compliance with the law.  But it concludes from that, <em>post</em>, at 11, that <em>any </em>sovereign attempt to compel compliance with the law can be deemed an exercise of the visitation power.  That conclusion obviously does not follow.  For example, in the course of exercising its visitation powers, the sovereign can assuredly compel a bank to honor obligations that are in default.  Does that mean that the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s taking the same action in executing a civil judgment for payment of those obligations can be considered an exercise of the visitation power?  Of course not.  Many things can be compelled through the visitation power that can be compelled through the exercise of other sovereign power as well.  The critical question is not what is being compelled, but what sovereign power has been invoked to compel it.  And the power to enforce the law exists separate and apart from the power of visitation.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d does not intrude upon the, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the historic police powers of the States,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 20, (quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Elevator Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/index.html">331 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (1947)), because, like federal maritime law, federal involvement in this field dates to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the earliest days of the Republic,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 21 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Locke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/89/index.html">529 U. S. 89</a>, 108 (2000).  For that reason, the dissent concludes, this case does not raise the sort of federalism concerns that prompt a presumption against pre-emption.  We have not invoked the presumption against pre-emption, and think it unnecessary to do so in giving force to the plain terms of the National Bank Act.  Neither, however, should the incursion that the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulation makes upon traditional state powers be minimized.  Although the sovereign visitorial power of assuring national-bank compliance with <em>all </em>laws inhered in the Federal Government from the time of its creation of national banks, the Comptroller was not given authority to enforce nonpre-empted state laws until 1966.  See Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, Tit. III, 80 Stat. 1046\xe2\x80\x931055.  A power first exercised during the lifetime of every current Justice is hardly involvement \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the earliest days of the Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States, on the other hand, have always enforced their general laws against national banks\xe2\x80\x94and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years, as evidenced by <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>, in which we upheld enforcement of a state anti-bank-branching law, 263 U.

That is much too kind.  It is not without reason that the regulation is contained within a subpart of the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s regulations on Bank Activities and Operations that is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPreemption.\xe2\x80\x9d  The purpose and function of the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d is to define and thereby limit the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States.  Any interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cdeclares the pre-emptive scope of the NBA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  What is clear from logic is also clear in application: The regulation declares that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate officials may not \xe2\x80\xa6 prosecut[e] enforcement actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 CFR \xc2\xa77.4000(a).  If that is not pre-emption, nothing is.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the foregoing principles to this case is not difficult.  \xe2\x80\x9cVisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d in the National Bank Act refers to a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory powers over corporations.  They include any form of administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on demand, even if the process is mediated by a court through prerogative writs or similar means.  The Comptroller reasonably interpreted this statutory term to include \xe2\x80\x9cconducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77.4000, when the State conducts those activities in its capacity as supervisor of corporations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer.  Such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d and thus the Comptroller erred by extending the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cprosecuting enforcement actions\xe2\x80\x9d in state courts, \xc2\xa77.4000. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The request for information in the present case was stated to be \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu of\xe2\x80\x9d other action; implicit was the threat that if the request was not voluntarily honored, that other action would be taken.  All parties have assumed, and we agree, that if the threatened action would have been unlawful the request-cum-threat could be enjoined.  Here the threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but rather the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of subpoena on his own authority under New York Executive Law, which permits such subpoenas in connection with his investigation of \xe2\x80\x9crepeated fraudulent or illegal acts . . . in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  See N.\xc2\xa0Y. Exec. Law Ann. \xc2\xa763(12) (West 2002).  That is not the exercise of the power of law enforcement \xe2\x80\x9cvested in the courts of justice\xe2\x80\x9d which 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a) exempts from the ban on exercise of supervisory power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the threatened issuance of executive subpoenas by the Attorney General for the State of New York, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter the dissent) attempts to distinguish <em>Dartmouth College </em>on the ground that the college was a charitable corporation, whose visitors (unlike the State as visitor of for-profit corporations) had no law-enforcement power.  See <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 7, n. 1.  We doubt that was so.  As Justice Story\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Dartmouth College </em>stated, visitors of charitable corporations had \xe2\x80\x9cpower . . . to correct all irregularities and abuses,\xe2\x80\x9d 4 Wheat., at 673, which would surely include operations in violation of law.  But whether or not visitors of charitable corporations had law-enforcement powers, the powers that they <em>did</em> possess demonstrate that visitation is different from ordinary law enforcement.  Indeed, if those powers did not include the power to assure compliance with law that demonstration would be all the more forceful.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent attempts to distinguish <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em> by invoking the principle that an agency is free to depart from a court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the law.  <em>Post</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (citing <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X</em> <em>Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 982 (2005)).  This again misses the point.  <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis </em>is relevant to proper interpretation of 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7484(a) not because it is authoritative on the question whether States can enforce their banking laws, but because it is one in a long and unbroken line of cases distinguishing visitation from law enforcement.  Respondents contend that <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis </em>holds only that States can enforce their law when federal law grants the national bank no authority to engage in the activity at issue.  Even if that were true it would make no difference.  The case would still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We reject respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, \xc2\xa7102(f)(1)(B), 108 Stat. 2349, 2350, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736(f)(1)(B), establishes that the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s visitorial power pre-empts state law enforcement.  That provision states that some state laws respecting bank branching \xe2\x80\x9cshall be enforced\xe2\x80\x9d by the Comptroller<em>.</em>  We need not decide here whether converting the Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s visitorial <em>power</em> to assure compliance with all applicable laws, see <em>infra</em>, at 12, into an <em>obligation </em>to assure compliance with certain state laws preempts state enforcement of those particular laws.  Even if it had that effect it would shed no light on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d in the National Bank Act, a statute that it does not refer to and that was enacted more than a century earlier.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The prohibition is not entirely categorical only because it is subject to the phrase at the end of the sentence (applicable to all of the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d forbidden to the States): \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  This replicates a similar exception contained in \xc2\xa7484(a) itself (\xe2\x80\x9cNo national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d), and certainly does not refer to case law finding state action nonpre-empted.  If it meant that, \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s apparent limitation of visitorial powers would be illusory\xe2\x80\x94saying, in effect, that national banks are subject to only those visitorial powers that the courts say they are subject to.  Cases that find state action nonpre-empted might perhaps be described as \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting\xe2\x80\x9d the state action in question, but hardly as \xe2\x80\x9cauthorizing\xe2\x80\x9d it.

To support this argument, the majority briefly alludes to the common-law history of visitation.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934;<em> </em>see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Shabani</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/10/index.html">513 U. S. 10</a>, 13 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]bsent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms\xe2\x80\x9d).  In so doing, the majority fully accepts petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress invoked a then-familiar common law term of corporate governance\xe2\x80\x94visitation\xe2\x80\x94to clarify that the States, traditionally the supervisors of private corporations doing business within their jurisdictions, had no authority to examine the condition of a national bank, respond to any perceived financial risk, or hold the bank to its charter or the laws of its creation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, any construction of \xc2\xa7484(a) that fails to preserve the right of the States to enforce through judicial action their generally applicable laws against national banks is unreasonable and, therefore, not entitled to deference.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s determination, the common-law tradition does not compel the conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s definition of visitation is the only permissible interpretation of the term.  Indeed, a more thorough examination of \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s common-law ancestry suggests the opposite.  As the majority notes, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934,<em> </em>the concept of visitation originated in Roman and canon law in which the term was used to describe the church hierarchy\xe2\x80\x99s authority over its own institutions, see Pound, Visitatorial Jurisdiction Over Corporations in Equity, 49 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 369, 369\xe2\x80\x93370 (1936).  The practice of visitation later expanded to include the supervision of charities, universities, and civil corporations.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>With respect to churches, charities, and universities, a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s duties were narrow.  In the university setting, for example, the \xe2\x80\x9cpower of the visitor [was] confined to offences against the <em>private</em> laws of the college; he ha[d] no cognizance of acts of disobedience to the general laws of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 S. Kyd, Law of Corporations 276 (1794) (emphasis in original).  The visitor\xe2\x80\x99s duties were equally narrow in the governance of ecclesiastical and charitable institutions.  See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England<em> </em>467\xe2\x80\x93472 (1765); <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College</em> v. <em>Woodward</em>, 4 Wheat. 518, 673\xe2\x80\x93677 (1819) (Story, J., concurring).  If the sweep of a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s authority with respect to civil corporations was the same, the majority would have a stronger argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition was similarly limited.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934. <em> </em>However, the common-law tradition instead suggests that visitorial powers were broader with respect to civil corporations, including banks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historically, visitorial authority over civil corporations was exercised only by the sovereign who had broad authority to assure compliance with generally applicable laws.  See Blackstone, <em>supra,</em> at 469 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe king being thus constituted by law the visitor of all civil corporations, the law has also appointed the place, wherein he shall exercise this jurisdiction: which is the court of king\xe2\x80\x99s bench; where, and where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corporations are enquired into and redressed, and all their controversies decided\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 241 (1827) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation of civil corporations is by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cCivil corporations, whether public, as the corporations of towns and cities; or private, as bank, insurance, manufacturing, and other companies of the like nature, are not subject to [private] visitation.  They are subject to the general law of the land, and amenable to the judicial tribunals for the exercise and the abuse of their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 244; see also J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, Law of Private Corporations \xc2\xa7684, p.\xc2\xa0680 (4th ed. 1852) (\xe2\x80\x9cCivil corporations, whether public or private, being created for public use and advantage, properly fall under the superintendency of that sovereign power whose duty it is to take care of the public interest; whereas, corporations, whose object is the distribution of a private benefaction, may well find jealous guardians in the zeal or vanity of the founder, his heirs, or appointees\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States have traditionally exercised their visitorial powers over civil corporations by invoking the authority of the judiciary to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel domestic corporations or their officers to perform specific duties incumbent on them by reason of their charters, <em>or under statutes or ordinances or imposed by the common law</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pound, <em>supra</em>, at 375 (emphasis added); see also S.

Indeed, Congress modeled the NBA after New York\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory regime.  See J. Knox, A History of Banking in the United States 422 (1903) (reprint 1969).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, that this understanding of the common law confuses the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement of general laws that apply equally to all actors within a State, like the ban on discrimination found in New York Executive Law \xc2\xa7296\xe2\x80\x93a\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9can exercise of visitorial powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 24; see also <em>ante</em>, at 7 (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9ca sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98visitorial powers\xe2\x80\x99 and its power to enforce the law are two different things\xe2\x80\x9d).  But this narrow conception of visitorial powers does not fully capture the common law.  In a section entitled \xe2\x80\x9cVisitorial power,\xe2\x80\x9d one treatise explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general rule the state has the same control, in this respect, over corporations that it has over individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Elliott, Law of Private Corporations<em> </em>\xc2\xa790, p.\xc2\xa080 (rev. 3d ed. 1900); see also 1 S. Thompson, Commentaries on the Law of Private Corporations \xc2\xa7475, p.\xc2\xa0580 (2d ed. 1908) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn its visitorial capacity the state checks and controls corporate affairs, even for the protection of those who deal with them\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s power of visitation was limited to oversight of \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d visitation would not parallel the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s control over individuals or allow the sovereign to protect through judicial action the rights of individuals who \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with\xe2\x80\x9d the corporation.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Wisconsin Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co.</em>, 35 Wis. 425 (1874)\xe2\x80\x94which has been referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe leading American case for the visitorial jurisdiction of equity,\xe2\x80\x9d Pound, 49<em> </em>Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 380\xe2\x80\x94illustrates the point.  In that case, the state attorney general sought a writ of injunction to \xe2\x80\x9crestrain the two defendant companies from exacting tolls for the carriage of passengers or freight in excess of the maximum rates established by\xe2\x80\x9d Wisconsin law, 35 Wis., at 432.  The attorney general \xe2\x80\x9cappl[ied] for the writ on behalf of the public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 531, in order \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to correct abuses and save the rights of the people,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 572.  The court found that the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s visitorial power included enforcement of generally applicable law against civil corporations through courts of equity.  See <em>id.</em>, at 529\xe2\x80\x93530.  As the court explained, the common-law understanding of visitorial powers had expanded beyond its ecclesiastical roots to include such authority.  See <em>id.</em>, at 530 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe grounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but the extent of its application has grown rapidly of late years, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant jurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public import\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that when \xe2\x80\x9ca state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, cannot be reconciled with this leading case or the general common-law understanding on which the decision rests.  At common law, all attempts by the sovereign to compel civil corporations to comply with state law\xe2\x80\x94whether through administrative subpoenas or judicial actions\xe2\x80\x94were visitorial in nature.  Thus, even if the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s law enforcement and visitorial powers were at one time distinct, by common law, they had merged at least with respect to the enforcement of generally applicable public laws against civil corporations.  See Thompson, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7460, at 556 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe police power, <em>in its visitorial aspect</em>, as exercised by congress and the several states, extends to the minutest details of the banking business\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  By construing visitation so narrowly, the majority implicitly rejects the efforts of William Blackstone, James Kent, and Roscoe Pound, see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, in elucidating the historical meaning of this concept.  Like OCC, each of these venerable legal scholars understood visitation of civil corporations to include the power to enforce generally applicable laws through judicial actions.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the end, OCC was presented with a broad dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitation\xe2\x80\x9d and a common-law history suggesting that the scope of the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s authority varied in accordance with the nature of the organization under supervision.  It is possible that the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d are narrower than OCC concluded.  But a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s powers could also be broader.  There is support for the proposition that visitation includes enforcement of all generally applicable laws.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310.<em> </em>OCC instead interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d to prohibit only enforcement of laws concerning \xe2\x80\x9cactivities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77.4000(a)(2)(iii) and (iv).  States are thus free to enforce applicable laws that do not regulate federally authorized banking activities, see \xc2\xa77.4000(a)(3), \xe2\x80\x9cincluding, for example, criminal, tax, zoning, and labor and employment laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Federal Respondent 15 (citing 69 Fed. Reg. 1896).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, although the text and history of visitation do not authoritatively support either party\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute, OCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to adopt a more modest construction than could have been supported by the common-law and dictionary definition reinforces the reasonableness of its regulation.  Put simply, OCC selected a permissible construction of a statutory term that was susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner nonetheless argues that the original structure of the NBA compels us to adopt his reading of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  When enacted in 1864, the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d clause was preceded by a statutory provision directing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint persons \xe2\x80\x9cto make a thorough examination into all the affairs of [every banking] association\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a full and detailed report of the condition of the association to the comptroller.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, \xc2\xa754, 13 Stat. 116.  In addition, the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d clause was succeeded by a sentence concerning the compensation due to the examiners.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Petitioner contends that the placement of the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d clause between these two provisions indicates that it originally meant to ban States only from conducting the particular type of \xe2\x80\x9cthorough examination\xe2\x80\x9d of banking affairs described in the neighboring provisions.  And, petitioner adds, \xc2\xa7484 currently resides in the subchapter of the statute entitled \xe2\x80\x9cBank Examinations,\xe2\x80\x9d which still includes a provision directing the Comptroller to appoint examiners \xe2\x80\x9cto make a thorough examination of all the affairs of the bank and \xe2\x80\xa6 make a full and detailed report of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of the Currency.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7481.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is undermined, however, by other structural attributes of this subchapter.  In \xc2\xa7484(b), for example, Congress provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d the statute\xe2\x80\x99s visitorial-powers prohibition, \xe2\x80\x9cState auditors and examiners may \xe2\x80\xa6 review [a national bank\xe2\x80\x99s] records solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such review does not fall within petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d because the enforcement of state property laws is in no way associated with national bank examinations or internal operations.  Thus, were \xc2\xa7484(a) to have the meaning petitioner assigns, there would have been no reason for Congress to identify the \xc2\xa7484(b) authority as an exception to \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition, as the authority granted in \xc2\xa7484(b) would never have been eliminated by \xc2\xa7484(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other exceptions in \xc2\xa7484 also support OCC\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute.  For example, \xc2\xa7484(a) includes an exception for visitations \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  One type of visitation authorized by law is described in 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73305(c), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing contained in [\xc2\xa7484] shall prevent any State from requiring any national\xe2\x80\x9d bank to provide payroll records and reports for unemployment tax purposes.  Similarly, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa762 permits state tax officials to inspect national bank shareholder lists.  Both provisions would be unnecessary if \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d were limited to bank examinations and internal operations</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the NBA\xe2\x80\x99s structure does not compel the construction of \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text that petitioner advocates.  If anything, given the manner in which Congress crafted exceptions to the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d ban in the statute, the opposite is true.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also accepts petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that OCC\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d is unreasonable because it conflicts with several of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937.

In so holding, the Court contrasted \xe2\x80\x9cthe private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested\xe2\x80\x9d with a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right\xe2\x80\x9d to examine \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct of the corporation with a view to keeping it within its legal powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 158\xe2\x80\x93159.  <em>Guthrie </em>thus draws a line between enforcement of private rights and the public act of visitation that is consistent with the definition of visitation embraced by OCC.  See <em>id.,</em> at 158 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn no case or authority that we have been able to find has there been a definition of this right, which would include the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).

The Court first held that federal law did not authorize national banks to engage in branch banking.  See <em>id.,</em> at 656\xe2\x80\x93659.  \xe2\x80\x9cHaving determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no justification in any law or authority of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court then concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe way is open for the enforcement of the state statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 660.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, and n.\xc2\xa02, that <em>St. Louis</em> stands for the proposition that a State retains the right to enforce any state law that is not substantively pre-empted with respect to national banks, see 263 U. S., at 660 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. What the state is seeking to do is to vindicate and enforce its own law\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under this view, then, because the New York fair lending laws are not substantively pre-empted, he is not exercising \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d by enforcing them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents counter that the holding of <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis </em>is not so broad.  In their view, the Court held only that a State may enforce its laws against a national bank when federal law grants the bank no authority to engage in the underlying activity at issue.  See Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  Here, federal law expressly authorizes national banks to make mortgage loans.  See 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7371(a).  Thus, unlike in <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>\xe2\x80\x94in which the relevant state-law-proscribed conduct in a category that was wholly beyond the powers granted to national banks\xe2\x80\x94petitioner seeks to superintend the manner in which the national banks engage in activity expressly authorized by federal law.  According to respondents, then, \xc2\xa7484(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on unauthorized visitation provides the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling reason\xe2\x80\x9d forbidding state enforcement that was absent from <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>, see 263 U. S., at 660.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no need to decide which party has the better argument.  The <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em> decision nowhere references \xc2\xa7484(a) or addresses \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, as noted above, even if the decision is best read to support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute, that conclusion is insufficient to deny <em>Chevron </em>deference to OCC\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa7484(a).  \xe2\x80\x9cSince <em>Chevron </em>teaches that a court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as to the best reading of an ambiguous statute an agency is charged with administering is not authoritative, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to construe that statute differently from a court does not say that the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding was legally wrong.  Instead, the agency may, consistent with the court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, choose a different construction, since the agency remains the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brand X</em>, 545 U. S., at 983.  A judicial decision that fails to directly confront the provision at issue cannot be deemed to have adopted the \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative\xe2\x80\x9d construction of the statute.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on other decisions of this Court is misplaced for this very same reason.

See <em>id.,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  In deciding that issue, the Court did not reach the question presented here.

The pre-emption of state enforcement authority to which petitioner objects thus follows from the statute itself\xe2\x80\x94not agency action.  See <em>Smiley</em>, 517 U. S., at 744 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis argument confuses the question of the substantive (as opposed to pre-emptive) <em>meaning</em> of a statute with the question of <em>whether </em>a statute is pre-emptive.

As <em>Smiley </em>showed, a federal agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of an ambiguous statutory term may clarify the pre-emptive scope of enacted federal law, but that fact alone does not mean that it is the agency, rather than Congress, that has effected the pre-emption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federalism-based objections to <em>Chevron </em>deference ultimately turn on a single proposition: It is doubtful that Congress pre-empted state enforcement of state laws but not the underlying state laws themselves.

See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.<em> </em>But there is strong evidence that visitors of civil corporations\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, sovereigns\xe2\x80\x94were so empowered.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The distinction between these species of visitation is crucial because<em> </em>it yields divergent understandings as to the scope of the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s power to enforce generally applicable laws in court.  Moreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s failure to confront this important difference leaves a gap in its historical analysis that, in turn, undermines its conclusion that OCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7484(a) was unreasonable.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, see <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa03, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s structural argument is also undermined by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal), 108 Stat. 2338, which authorized national banks to operate interstate branches.  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he laws of the host State regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches shall apply to any branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank to the same extent as such State laws apply to a branch of a bank chartered by that State\xe2\x80\x9d unless federal law separately pre-empts their application or the Comptroller determines that application of the state law would have a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the national bank branch.  See <em>id.</em>, at 2349\xe2\x80\x932350, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736(f)(1)(A).  Riegle-Neal further provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced, with respect to such branch, by the Comptroller of the Currency.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 2350, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa736(f)(1)(B).  The United States has interpreted the \xe2\x80\x9cshall be enforced\xe2\x80\x9d language to provide OCC with exclusive enforcement authority.  See Brief for Federal Respondent 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  This construction reinforces OCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7484(a).  If OCC has exclusive authority to enforce state law with respect to interstate branches of national banks, it would be reasonable to interpret the statute to operate similarly with respect to the national banks themselves.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>First Nat. Bank in St.\xc2\xa0Louis </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/640/index.html"></a><a href="/us/263/640/index.html">263 U. S. 640</a> (1924), is not \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative\xe2\x80\x9d falls short of the mark.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa02; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eading \xe2\x80\x98visitorial powers\xe2\x80\x99 as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\xe2\x80\x94the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to the majority, irrespective of which party has the better reading of that case, it \xe2\x80\x9cwould still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa02.  But that conclusion rests on the assumption that the <em>St.\xc2\xa0Louis </em>Court shared the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conception of law enforcement and visitation as categorically distinct for purposes of \xc2\xa7484(a).  It is impossible to verify that assumption, however, because the bank never raised the \xe2\x80\x9cvisitorial powers\xe2\x80\x9d defense in that case.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6.  If the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine is to have any interpretative value, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a statute cannot be foreclosed by a prior judicial decision in which the provision in question was neither raised by the parties nor passed upon by the court.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority contends that <em>Watters</em> is \xe2\x80\x9cfully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But this argument ignores the reach of the statutes that the Court assumed were visitorial in <em>Watters</em>.  The Michigan laws at issue in <em>Watters </em>allowed for much more than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98general supervision and control\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the operating subsidiaries of national banks.  <em>Ante, </em>at 6.<em> </em> They also included provisions permitting the state attorney general to \xe2\x80\x9ctake any appropriate legal action to enjoin the operation of the business\xe2\x80\x9d and allowing the commissioner \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o bring an action in \xe2\x80\xa6 circuit court in the name and on behalf of this state\xe2\x80\x9d to enjoin \xe2\x80\x9cany unsafe or injurious practice or act in violation of this act or a rule promulgated under this act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mich.
