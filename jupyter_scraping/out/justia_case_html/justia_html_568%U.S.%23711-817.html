Observing Harris\xe2\x80\x99s nervousness and an open beer can, Wheetley sought consent to search Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  When Harris refused, Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo.  The dog alerted at the driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side door handle, leading Wheetley to conclude that he had probable cause for a search.  That search turned up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephedrine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine.  Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those ingredients.  In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo again alerted on Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck but nothing of interest was found.  At a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s extensive training in drug detection.  Harris\xe2\x80\x99s attorney did not contest the quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s certification and performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida Supreme Court reversed.  It held that a wide array of evidence was always necessary to establish probable cause, including field-performance records showing how many times the dog has falsely alerted.  If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator of drugs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Because training and testing records supported Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s reliability in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that evidence, Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.

Gates, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n.  To evaluate whether the State has met this practical and common-sensical standard, this Court has consistently looked to the totality of the circumstances and rejected rigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries.

Requiring the State to introduce comprehensive documentation of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s prior hits and misses in the field, and holding that absent field records will preclude a finding of probable cause no matter how much other proof the State offers, is the antithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances approach.  This is made worse by the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of field-performance records as the evidentiary gold standard when, in fact, such data may not capture a dog\xe2\x80\x99s false negatives or may markedly overstate a dog\xe2\x80\x99s false positives.  Such inaccuracies do not taint records of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s performance in standard training and certification settings, making that performance a better measure of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability.  Field records may sometimes be relevant, but the court should evaluate all the evidence, and should not prescribe an inflexible set of requirements.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the correct approach, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog\xe2\x80\x99s alert should proceed much like any other, with the court allowing the parties to make their best case and evaluating the totality of the circumstances.  If the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, the court should find probable cause.  But a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.  The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed or too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert.  The court should then consider all the evidence and apply the usual test for probable cause\xe2\x80\x94whether all the facts surrounding the alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime.

The State introduced substantial evidence of Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s training and his proficiency in finding drugs.  Harris declined to challenge any aspect of that training or testing in the trial court, and the Court does not consider such arguments when they are presented for this first time in this Court.  Harris principally relied below on Wheetley\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find any substance that Aldo was trained to detect.  That infers too much from the failure of a particular alert to lead to drugs, and did not rebut the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence from recent training and testing.

The Florida Supreme Court held that the State must in every case present an exhaustive set of records, including a log of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s performance in the field, to establish the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability.

On June 24, 2006, he was on a routine patrol with Aldo, a German shepherd trained to detect certain narcotics (methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy).  Wheetley pulled over respondent Clayton Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck because it had an expired license plate.  On approaching the driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side door, Wheetley saw that Harris was \xe2\x80\x9cvisibly nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d unable to sit still, shaking, and breathing rapidly.  Wheetley also noticed an open can of beer in the truck\xe2\x80\x99s cup holder.  App. 62.  Wheetley asked Harris for consent to search the truck, but Harris refused.  At that point, Wheetley retrieved Aldo from the patrol car and walked him around Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck for a \xe2\x80\x9cfree air sniff.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 63.  Aldo alerted at the driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side door handle\xe2\x80\x94signaling, through a distinctive set of behaviors, that he smelled drugs there.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWheetley concluded, based principally on Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s alert, that he had probable cause to search the truck.  His search did not turn up any of the drugs Aldo was trained to detect.  But it did reveal 200 loose pseudoephedrine pills, 8,000 matches, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, two containers of antifreeze, and a coffee filter full of iodine crystals\xe2\x80\x94all ingredients for making methamphetamine.  Wheetley accordingly arrested Harris, who admitted after proper Miranda warnings that he routinely \xe2\x80\x9ccooked\xe2\x80\x9d methamphetamine at his house and could not go \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a few days without using\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Id., at 68.  The State charged Harris with possessing pseudoephedrine for use in manufacturing methamphetamine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile out on bail, Harris had another run-in with Wheetley and Aldo.  This time, Wheetley pulled Harris over for a broken brake light.  Aldo again sniffed the truck\xe2\x80\x99s exterior, and again alerted at the driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side door handle.  Wheetley once more searched the truck, but on this occasion discovered nothing of interest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHarris moved to suppress the evidence found in his truck on the ground that Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s alert had not given Wheetley probable cause for a search.  At the hearing on that motion, Wheetley testified about both his and Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s training in drug detection.  See id., at 52\xe2\x80\x9382.  In 2004, Wheetley (and a different dog) completed a 160-hour course in narcotics detection offered by the Dothan, Alabama Police Department, while Aldo (and a different handler) completed a similar, 120-hour course given by the Apopka, Florida Police Department.  That same year, Aldo received a one-year certification from Drug Beat, a private company that specializes in testing and certifying K\xe2\x80\x939 dogs.  Wheetley and Aldo teamed up in 2005 and went through another, 40-hour refresher course in Dothan together.  They also did four hours of training exercises each week to maintain their skills.  Wheetley would hide drugs in certain ve- hicles or buildings while leaving others \xe2\x80\x9cblank\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether Aldo alerted at the right places.  Id., at 57.  According to Wheetley, Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s performance in those exercises was \xe2\x80\x9creally good.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 60.  The State introduced \xe2\x80\x9cMonthly Canine Detection Training Logs\xe2\x80\x9d consistent with that testimony: They showed that Aldo always found hidden drugs and that he performed \xe2\x80\x9csatisfactorily\xe2\x80\x9d (the higher of two possible assessments) on each day of training.  Id., at 109\xe2\x80\x93116.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn cross-examination, Harris\xe2\x80\x99s attorney chose not to contest the quality of Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s or Wheetley\xe2\x80\x99s training.  She focused instead on Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s certification and his performance in the field, particularly the two stops of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  Wheetley conceded that the certification (which, he noted, Florida law did not require) had expired the year before he pulled Harris over.  See id., at 70\xe2\x80\x9371.  Wheetley also acknowledged that he did not keep complete records of Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s performance in traffic stops or other field work; instead, he maintained records only of alerts resulting in arrests.  See id., at 71\xe2\x80\x9372, 74.  But Wheetley defended Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s two alerts to Harris\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly narcotics-free truck:  According to Wheetley, Harris probably transferred the odor of methamphetamine to the door handle, and Aldo responded to that \xe2\x80\x9cresidual odor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 80.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court concluded that Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck and so denied the motion to suppress.  Harris then entered a no-contest plea while reserving the right to appeal the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  An intermediate state court summarily affirmed.

So too here, a finding of a drug-detection dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability cannot depend on the State\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction of multiple, independent evidentiary requirements.  No more for dogs than for human informants is such an inflexible checklist the way to prove reliability, and thus establish probable cause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMaking matters worse, the decision below treats records of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s field performance as the gold standard in evidence, when in most cases they have relatively limited import.  Errors may abound in such records.  If a dog on patrol fails to alert to a car containing drugs, the mistake usually will go undetected because the officer will not initiate a search.  Field data thus may not capture a dog\xe2\x80\x99s false negatives.  Conversely (and more relevant here), if the dog alerts to a car in which the officer finds no narcotics, the dog may not have made a mistake at all.  The dog may have detected substances that were too well hidden or present in quantities too small for the officer to locate.  Or the dog may have smelled the residual odor of drugs previously in the vehicle or on the driver\xe2\x80\x99s person.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Field data thus may markedly overstate a dog\xe2\x80\x99s real false positives.  By contrast, those inaccuracies\xe2\x80\x94in either direction\xe2\x80\x94do not taint records of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s performance in standard training and certification settings.  There, the designers of an assessment know where drugs are hidden and where they are not\xe2\x80\x94and so where a dog should alert and where he should not.  The better measure of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability thus comes away from the field, in controlled testing environments.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor that reason, evidence of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself provide sufficient reason to trust his alert.  If a bona fide organization has certified a dog after testing his reliability in a controlled setting, a court can presume (subject to any conflicting evidence offered) that the dog\xe2\x80\x99s alert provides probable cause to search.  The same is true, even in the absence of formal certification, if the dog has recently and successfully completed a training program that evaluated his proficiency in locating drugs.  After all, law enforcement units have their own strong incentive to use effective training and certification programs, because only accurate drug-detection dogs enable officers to locate contraband without incurring unnecessary risks or wasting limited time and resources.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA defendant, however, must have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.  The defendant, for example, may contest the adequacy of a certification or training program, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax or its methods faulty.  So too, the defendant may examine how the dog (or handler) performed in the assessments made in those settings.  Indeed, evidence of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s (or handler\xe2\x80\x99s) history in the field, although susceptible to the kind of misinterpretation we have discussed, may sometimes be relevant, as the Solicitor General acknowledged at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the stand, about field performance, and then the court can give that answer whatever weight is appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).  And even assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances surrounding a particular alert may undermine the case for probable cause\xe2\x80\x94if, say, the officer cued the dog (consciously or not), or if the team was working under un- familiar conditions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog\xe2\x80\x99s alert should proceed much like any other.  The court should allow the parties to make their best case, consistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure.  And the court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to decide what all the circumstances demonstrate.  If the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the court should find probable cause.  If, in contrast, the defendant has challenged the State\xe2\x80\x99s case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence.  In all events, the court should not prescribe, as the Florida Supreme Court did, an inflexible set of evidentiary requirements.  The question\xe2\x80\x94similar to every inquiry into probable cause\xe2\x80\x94is whether all the facts surrounding a dog\xe2\x80\x99s alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reason- ably prudent person think that a search would reveal con- traband or evidence of a crime.  A sniff is up to snuff when it meets that test.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd here, Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s did.  The record in this case amply supported the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s alert gave Wheetley probable cause to search Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State, as earlier described, introduced substantial evidence of Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s training and his proficiency in finding drugs.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The State showed that two years before alerting to Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck, Aldo had successfully completed a 120-hour program in narcotics detection, and separately obtained a certification from an independent company.  And although the certification expired after a year, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office required continuing training for Aldo and Wheetley.  The two satisfied the requirements of another, 40-hour training program one year prior to the search at issue.  And Wheetley worked with Aldo for four hours each week on exercises designed to keep their skills sharp.  Wheetley testified, and written records confirmed, that in those settings Aldo always performed at the highest level.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHarris, as also noted above, declined to challenge in the trial court any aspect of Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s training.  See supra, at 3.  To be sure, Harris\xe2\x80\x99s briefs in this Court raise questions about that training\xe2\x80\x99s adequacy\xe2\x80\x94for example, whether the programs simulated sufficiently diverse environments and whether they used enough blind testing (in which the handler does not know the location of drugs and so cannot cue the dog).  See Brief for Respondent 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  Similarly, Harris here queries just how well Aldo performed in controlled testing.  See id., at 58.  But Harris never voiced those doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the first time here.  See, e.g., Rugendorf v. United States, \n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528, \n534 (1964)\n.  As the case came to the trial court, Aldo had successfully completed two recent drug-detection courses and maintained his proficiency through weekly training exercises.  Viewed alone, that training record\xe2\x80\x94with or without the prior certification\xe2\x80\x94sufficed to establish Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s reliability.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd Harris\xe2\x80\x99s cross-examination of Wheetley, which focused on Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s field performance, failed to rebut the State\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Harris principally contended in the trial court that because Wheetley did not find any of the substances Aldo was trained to detect, Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s two alerts must have been false.  See Brief for Respondent 1; App. 77\xe2\x80\x9380.  But we have already described the hazards of inferring too much from the failure of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s alert to lead to drugs, see supra, at 7; and here we doubt that Harris\xe2\x80\x99s logic does justice to Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s skills.  Harris cooked and used methamphetamine on a regular basis; so as Wheetley later surmised, Aldo likely responded to odors that Harris had transferred to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side door handle of his truck.  See supra, at 3.  A well-trained drug-detection dog should alert to such odors; his response to them might appear a mistake, but in fact is not.  See n.\xc2\xa02, supra.  And still more fundamentally, we do not evaluate probable cause in hindsight, based on what a search does or does not turn up.  See United States v. Di Re, \n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581, \n595 (1948)\n.  For the reasons already stated, Wheetley had good cause to view Aldo as a reliable detector of drugs.  And no special circumstance here gave Wheetley reason to discount Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s usual dependability or distrust his response to Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause training records established Aldo\xe2\x80\x99s reliability in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that showing, we agree with the trial court that Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0By the time of oral argument in this case, even Harris declined to defend the idea that the \n  compels the State to produce each item of evidence the Florida Supreme Court enumerated.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the Constitution requires [that list]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Harris instead argued that the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, although \xe2\x80\x9clook[ing] rather didactic,\xe2\x80\x9d in fact did not impose any such requirement.  Id., at 29; see id., at 31 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t\xe2\x80\x99s not a specific recipe that can\xe2\x80\x99t be de-viated from\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in reading the decision below as establishing a man-datory checklist, we do no more than take the court at its (oft-repeated) word.  See, e.g., 71 So. 3d 756, 758, 759, 771, 775 (Fla. 2011) (holding that the State \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d present the itemized evidence).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See U.\xc2\xa0S. Dept. of Army, Military Working Dog Program 30 (Pamphlet 190\xe2\x80\x9312, 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe odor of a substance may be present in enough concentration to cause the dog to respond even after the substance has been removed.

But that statement reflects a misunderstanding.  A detection dog recognizes an odor, not a drug, and should alert whenever the scent is present, even if the substance is gone (just as a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s much inferior nose detects the odor of marijuana for some time after a joint has been smoked).
