The two-parent notice requirement is mandatory unless, <em>inter alia,</em> the woman declares that she is a victim of parental abuse or neglect, in which event notice of her declaration must be given to the proper authorities.  Subdivision 6 provides that, if a court enjoins the enforcement of subdivision 2, the same two-parent notice requirement is effective unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders the abortion to proceed without notice upon proof by the minor that she is "mature and capable of giving informed consent" or that an abortion without notice to both parents would be in her best interest.  Two days before the statute\'s effective date, a group consisting of doctors, clinics, pregnant minors, and the mother of a pregnant minor filed suit in the District Court, alleging that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court declared the statute unconstitutional in its entirety, and enjoined its enforcement.  The Court of Appeals, sitting in banc, reversed.  Although it rejected the State\'s submission that subdivision 2\'s two-parent notice requirement was constitutional without any bypass procedure, the court held that subdivision 6 was valid and that its bypass procedure saved the statute as a whole.  The court also rejected the argument that the 48-hour waiting period imposed a significant burden on the minor\'s abortion right.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>853 F.2d 1452 (CA8 1988), affirmed.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IV, and VII, concluding that subdivision 2 of \xc2\xa7 144.343 violates the Constitution insofar as it requires two-parent notification.</p>\n<p>(a) Since none of this Court\'s abortion decisions dealing with parental consent or notification statutes focused on the possible significance of making the consent or notice applicable to both parents instead of just </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 497 U. S. 418</a></p><p> one, the District Court\'s extensive and unchallenged findings on the question are significant.  On the basis of extensive trial testimony, the District Court found, <em>inter alia,</em> that the two-parent notification requirement had particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent when the parents were divorced or separated, especially in the context of an abusive or dysfunctional family; that the requirement also had adverse effects in families in which the minor lives with both parents, particularly where family violence is a serious problem; that the requirement actually impairs family communication in many instances, since minors who otherwise would inform one parent were unwilling to do so when such notification would involve going to court for a bypass in any event; that few minors can take advantage of the abuse exception because of the obligation to report the information to the authorities and the attendant loss of privacy; and that the two-parent requirement did not further the State\'s interests in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity.  The court also found that, in many cases, the statutory 48-hour waiting period was extended to a week or more by scheduling considerations, thereby increasing the risk associated with the abortion to a statistically significant degree.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#436">497 U. S. 436</a></span>-444.</p>\n<p>(b) The requirement that <em>both</em> parents be notified, whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed responsibility for the upbringing of the child, does not reasonably further any legitimate state interest.  Any such interest in supporting the authority of a parent, who is presumed to act in the minor\'s best interest, to assure that the abortion decision is knowing, intelligent, and deliberate, would be fully served by a one-parent notification requirement as to functioning families, where notice to either parent would normally constitute notice to both.  As to the many families in which the parent notified would not notify the other parent, the State has no legitimate interest in questioning the first parent\'s judgment or in presuming him or her incompetent to make decisions regarding the child\'s health and welfare.  Moreover, as the record demonstrates, the two-parent requirement actually disserves the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with respect to the thousands of dysfunctional families affected by the statute, where the requirement proved positively harmful.  There is no merit to the argument that the two-parent requirement is justified because, in the ideal family, the minor should make her decision only after consultation with both parents, who should naturally be concerned with her welfare.  The State has no legitimate interest in conforming family life to a state-designed ideal by requiring family members to talk together.  Nor can the State\'s interest in protecting a parent\'s interest in shaping a child\'s values and lifestyle overcome the liberty interests of a minor acting with the consent of a single parent or court.  The combined force of the separate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 497 U. S. 419</a></p><p> interest of one parent and the minor\'s privacy interest outweighs the separate interest of the second parent, and the justification for any rule requiring parental involvement in the abortion decision rests entirely on the best interests of the child.  The fact that the two-parent requirement is virtually an oddity among state and federal consent provisions governing childrens\' health, welfare, and education further demonstrates its unreasonableness and the ease with which the State can adopt less burdensome means to protect the minor\'s welfare.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U. S. 450</a></span>-455.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, joined by Justice O\'CONNOR, concluded in Parts V and VI that:</p>\n<p>1. Three separate but related interests are relevant to the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period and the two-parent notification requirement.  First, the State has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.  That interest justifies a state-imposed requirement that the minor notify and consult with a parent before terminating her pregnancy.  <em>See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/502/case.html#510">497 U. S. 510</a></span>-511.  Second, parents have an interest in controlling their childrens\' education and upbringing, and a natural parent\'s stake in the relationship with a child may rise to the level of a protected liberty interest if the parent has demonstrated his commitment by assuming personal, financial, or custodial responsibility for the child.  Third, the family has a privacy interest in its childrens\' upbringing and education which is constitutionally protected against undue state interference.  When government intrudes on the family\'s choices, the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation must be carefully examined.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#444">497 U. S. 444</a></span>-448.</p>\n<p>2. To the extent that subdivision 2 of the state statute requires that a minor wait 48 hours after notifying a single parent of her intention to obtain an abortion, it reasonably furthers the legitimate state interest in ensuring that the minor\'s decision is knowing and intelligent.  The State may properly enact laws designed to aid a parent who has assumed "primary responsibility" for a minor\'s wellbeing in discharging that responsibility, and the 48-hour delay provides the parent the opportunity to consult with his or her spouse and a family physician, to inquire into the competency of the abortion doctor, and to discuss the decision\'s religious and moral implications with the minor and provide needed guidance and counsel as to how the decision will affect her future.  The delay imposes only a minimal burden on the minor\'s rights.  The statute does not impose any period of delay if the parents or a court, acting <em>in loco parentis,</em> provide consent to the procedure.  Moreover, the record reveals that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 497 U. S. 420</a></p><p> the waiting period may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the abortion.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U. S. 448</span>-449.</p>\n<p>Justice O\'CONNOR concluded that subdivision 6 of the state statute -- two-parent notification plus judicial bypass -- passes constitutional muster because the interference with the family\'s internal operation required by subdivision 2\'s two-parent notice requirement simply does not exist where the minor can avoid notifying one or both parents by using the bypass procedure.  <em>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html">428 U. S. 52</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#90">428 U.

S. 461</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice SCALIA, concluded:</p>\n<p>1. The state statute\'s 48-hour waiting period is necessary to enable notified parents to consult with their daughter or her physician, if they so wish, results in little or no delay, and is therefore constitutional.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#496">497 U. S. 496</a></span>-497.</p>\n<p>2. Subdivision 6 of the statute -- which requires two-parent notification unless the pregnant minor obtains a judicial bypass --  is constitutional.  By creating a judicial mechanism to identify, and exempt from the strictures of the law, those cases in which the minor is mature or in which parental notification is not in her best interest, subdivision 6 precisely addresses the concern underlying the Court\'s invalidation of subdivision 2:  the possibility that, in some cases, two-parent notification would not work to the benefit of minors or their parents.  In providing for the bypass, moreover, Minnesota has simply attempted to fit its legislation into the framework supplied by this Court\'s previous cases, particularly <em>Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html">443 U. S. 622</a></span>, which stands for the proposition that a two-parent consent law is constitutional if it provides for a sufficient judicial bypass alternative.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U. S. 643</a></span> (opinion of Powell, J.); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#656">443 U. S. 656</a></span>-657 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  The conclusion that subdivision 6 must be sustained is compelled not only by <em>Bellotti</em> but also by <em>H.L. v. Matheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html">450 U. S. 398</a></span>, in which the Court held that a two-parent notice statute without a bypass was constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests would be served by notice.  If that is the case, but if such a law is not constitutional as applied to minors who are mature or whose best interests are not so served, a judicial bypass is an expeditious and efficient means by which to separate the applications of the law which are constitutional from those which are not.

In subdivisions 2-4 of the statute, the notice is mandatory unless (1) the attending physician certifies that an immediate abortion is necessary to prevent the woman\'s death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice; (2) both of her parents have consented in writing; or (3) the woman declares that she is a victim of parental abuse or neglect, in which event notice of her declaration must be given to the proper authorities.  The United States Court of Appeals for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 497 U. S. 423</a></p><p> Eighth Circuit, sitting en banc, unanimously held this provision unconstitutional.  In No. 88-1309, we granted the State\'s petition to review that holding.  Subdivision 6 of the same statute provides that, if a court enjoins the enforcement of subdivision 2, the same notice requirement shall be effective unless the pregnant woman obtains a court order permitting the abortion to proceed.  By a vote of 7-3, the Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of subdivision 6.  In No. 88-1125, we granted the plaintiffs\' petition to review that holding.</p>\n<p>For reasons that follow, we now conclude that the requirement of notice to both of the pregnant minor\'s parents is not reasonably related to legitimate state interests, and that subdivision 2 is unconstitutional.  A different majority of the Court, for reasons stated in separate opinions, concludes that subdivision 6 is constitutional.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The parental notice statute was enacted in 1981 as an amendment to the Minors\' Consent to Health Services Act.  The earlier statute, which remains in effect as subdivision 1 of \xc2\xa7 144.343 and as \xc2\xa7 144.346, had modified the common law requirement of parental consent for any medical procedure performed on minors.  It authorized "any minor" to give effective consent without any parental involvement for the treatment of "pregnancy and conditions associated therewith, venereal disease, alcohol and other drug abuse." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 497 U. S. 424</a></p><p>  The statute, unlike others of its age, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] applied to abortion services.</p>\n<p>The 1981 amendment qualified the authority of an "unemancipated minor" [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] to give effective consent to an abortion by requiring that either her physician or an agent notify "the parent" personally or by certified mail at least 48 hours before the procedure is performed. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The term "parent" is defined in subdivision 3 to mean "both parents of the pregnant woman if they are both living."  No exception is made for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 497 U. S. 425</a></p><p> a divorced parent, a noncustodial parent, or a biological parent who never married or lived with the pregnant woman\'s mother. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The statute does provide however, that if only one parent is living, or "if the second one cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort," notice to one parent is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 497 U. S. 426</a></p><p> sufficient. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  It also makes exceptions for cases in which emergency treatment prior to notice "is necessary to prevent the woman\'s death," both parents have already given their consent in writing, or the proper authorities are advised that the minor is a victim of sexual or physical abuse. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The statute subjects a person performing an abortion in violation of its terms to criminal sanctions and to civil liability in an action brought by any person "wrongfully denied notification." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 497 U. S. 427</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Subdivision 6 authorizes a judicial bypass of the two-parent notice requirement if subdivision 2 is ever "temporarily or permanently" enjoined by judicial order.  If the pregnant minor can convince "any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction" that she is "mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion," or that an abortion without notice to both parents would be in her best interest, the court can authorize the physician to proceed without notice.  The statute provides that the bypass procedure shall be confidential, that it shall be expedited, that the minor has a right to court-appointed counsel, and that she shall be afforded free access to the court "24 hours a day, seven days a week."  An order denying an abortion can be appealed on an expedited basis, but an order authorizing an abortion without notification is not subject to appeal. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 497 U. S. 428</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The statute contains a severability provision, but it does not include a statement of its purposes.  The Minnesota Attorney General has advised us that those purposes are apparent from the statutory text, and that they</p>\n<p>"include the recognition and fostering of parent-child relationships, promoting counsel to a child in a difficult and traumatic choice, and providing for notice to those who are naturally most concerned for the child\'s welfare. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]"</p>\n<p>The District Court found that the primary purpose of the legislation was to protect the wellbeing of minors by encouraging them to discuss with their parents the decision whether to terminate their pregnancies. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It also found that the legislature was motivated by a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 497 U. S. 429</a></p><p> desire to deter and dissuade minors from choosing to terminate their pregnancies. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Attorney General, however, disclaims any reliance on this purpose. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This litigation was commenced on July 30, 1981, two days before the effective date of the parental notification statute.  The plaintiffs include two Minnesota doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, four clinics providing abortion and contraceptive services in metropolitan areas in Minnesota, six pregnant minors representing a class of pregnant minors, and the mother of a pregnant minor.  Plaintiffs alleged that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and various provisions of the Minnesota Constitution.</p>\n<p>Based on the allegations in their verified complaint, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order enjoining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 497 U. S. 430</a></p><p> the enforcement of subdivision 2 of the statute.  After a hearing, the court entered a preliminary injunction which still remains in effect.  App. 31.  The District Court refused, however, to rule on the validity of the judicial bypass procedure in advance of trial. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1986, after a 5-week trial, the District Court concluded that both the two-parent notification requirement and the 48-hour waiting period were invalid.  It further concluded that the definition of the term "parent," which is carried over into the notification requirement, was not severable from the remainder of the statute.  The court declared the entire statute unconstitutional and enjoined the defendants from enforcing it.</p>\n<p>A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The court first held that a compulsory notification requirement is invalid if it does not provide the pregnant minor with the option of an alternative court procedure in which she can demonstrate either her maturity or that performance of an abortion without notification would be in her best interests.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-1125, p. 62a.  Second, relying heavily on the findings of the District Court concerning the impact of a two-parent notice requirement on families in which the parents are divorced, separated, or unmarried, the panel also concluded that the unconstitutional notification requirement could not be saved by the judicial bypass.  The court reasoned that a mature minor and her custodial parent are in a better position than a court to determine whether notifying the noncustodial parent would be in the child\'s best interests and that they should not be forced to submit to a "Hobson\'s choice" between an unconstitutional notice requirement and a burdensome court bypass. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The panel further </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 497 U. S. 431</a></p><p> held that the two-parent notice requirement was not severable. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The panel opinion was vacated, and the Court of Appeals reheard the case en banc.  853 F.2d 1452 (CA8 1988).  The court unanimously and summarily rejected the State\'s submission that the two-parent notice requirement was constitutional without any bypass procedure.  <em>Id.</em> at 1456-1457.  The majority concluded, however, that subdivision 6 of the statute was valid.  It agreed with the District Court that the development of a full factual record may demonstrate that a facially valid statute is "unconstitutional in operation," <em>id.</em> at 1459, and that</p>\n<p>"the detailed factual findings concerning the general difficulties of obtaining an abortion in Minnesota and the trauma of the bypass procedure, compared to its effectiveness, raise considerable questions about the practical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 497 U. S. 432</a></p><p> wisdom of this statute."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In the majority\'s opinion, however, those questions were for the legislature to consider because the statute served valid state interests:  the interest in</p>\n<p>"\'encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child,\' [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]"</p>\n<p>as well as the independent interest of the parents in the upbringing of their children. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>After noting that the State did not challenge the District Court\'s findings, <em>id.</em> at 1462, the court concluded that these findings placed undue emphasis on one-parent and no-parent households.  For even though the two-parent notice requirement may not further the interests of the pregnant minor in such cases, the rights of "best-interest" and mature minors were nevertheless protected by the bypass procedure.  More importantly,</p>\n<p>"as applied to all pregnant minors, regardless of their family circumstances, the district court did not consider whether parental and family interests (as distinguished from the interests of the minor alone) justified the two-parent notice requirement."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1463.  The court wrote:</p>\n<p>"The district court enjoined the entire statute because of the impact of the two-parent notice requirement primarily upon one group of pregnant minors, without considering the effect of the bypass or the parental and family interests which have been recognized by the Supreme Court.  In concentrating upon the impact of the statute on the pregnant minor not living with both parents, and on the mature or non best-interest pregnant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 497 U. S. 433</a></p><p> minor, the district court gave only limited consideration to the 50% or more pregnant minors who live with both parents and to pregnant minors who are immature and whose best interests may require parental involvement.  The district court\'s determination that an undue burden on the one group renders the statute unconstitutional for all is contrary to the Supreme Court\'s decision that a notice-consent/bypass procedure plainly serves important state interests and is narrowly drawn to protect only those interests. . . .   Considering the statute as a whole and as applied to all pregnant minors, the two-parent notice requirement does not unconstitutionally burden the minor\'s abortion right."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1464-1465 (citation omitted).  The Court of Appeals also rejected the argument that the 48-hour waiting period imposed a significant burden on the minor\'s abortion right, finding that the waiting period could run concurrently with the scheduling of an appointment for the procedure.  Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the District Court without reaching the question of severability. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>In dissent, two members of the court criticized the majority for ignoring "the evidence amassed in a five-week trial," for relying on the judicial bypass procedure "to uphold an unconstitutional two-parent notification requirement," and for creating "a new right, apparently of constitutional dimension, for noncustodial parents to receive notice of their minor children\'s activities."  <em>Id.</em> at 1466.  One of the dissenters joined a third dissenter in expressing the opinion that "a single-parent notification requirement would withstand constitutional challenge."  <em>Id.</em> at 1472.  We granted certiorari, 492 U.S. 917 (1989). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 497 U.

Indeed, considering her probable education, employment skills, financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor.  In addition, the fact of having a child brings with it adult legal responsibility, for parenthood, like attainment of the age of majority, is one of the traditional criteria for the termination of the legal disabilities of minority.  In sum, there are few situations in which denying a minor the right to make an important decision will have consequences so grave and indelible."</p>\n<p><em>Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html">443 U. S. 622</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#642">443 U.

Thus, the constitutional protection against unjustified state intrusion into the process of deciding whether or not to bear a child extends to pregnant minors as well as adult women.</p>\n<p>In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis.  State regulation of travel and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, <em>Shapiro v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html">394 U.

S. 94</a></span>-99 (1987).  But the regulation of constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or she shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other than disagreement with the choice the individual has made.  <em>Cf. Turner v. Safley, supra; Loving v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/case.html">388 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/case.html#12">388 U. S. 12</a></span> (1967).  In the abortion area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use its own facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults.  <em>See, e.g., Maher v. Roe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/464/case.html">432 U. S. 464</a></span> (1977); <em>cf. Webster v.

S. 523</a></span>-524 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  A State\'s value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support for decisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply substituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has a right to make for herself.  Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause would be a nullity.  A state policy favoring childbirth over abortion is not, in itself, a sufficient justification for overriding the woman\'s decision or for placing "obstacles -- absolute or otherwise -- in the pregnant woman\'s path to an abortion."  <em>Maher,</em> 432 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/464/case.html#474">432 U.

S. 436</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In these cases, the State of Minnesota does not rest its defense of this statute on any such value judgment.  Indeed, it affirmatively disavows that state interest as a basis for upholding this law. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Moreover, it is clear that the state judges who have interpreted the statute in over 3,000 decisions implementing its bypass procedures have found no legislative intent to disfavor the decision to terminate a pregnancy.  On the contrary, in all but a handful of cases, they have approved such decisions. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Because the Minnesota statute unquestionably places obstacles in the pregnant minor\'s path to an abortion, the State has the burden of establishing its constitutionality.  Under any analysis, the Minnesota statute cannot be sustained if the obstacles it imposes are not reasonably related to legitimate state interests.  <em>Cf. Turner v.

[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Although the Massachusetts statute reviewed in <em>Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976) (<em>Bellotti I</em>), and <em>Bellotti II</em> required the consent of both parents, and the Utah statute reviewed in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html">H.L. </a></span></em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 497 U.

In contrast, the arguments in these cases, as well as the extensive findings of the District Court, are directed primarily at that distinction.  It is therefore appropriate to summarize these findings before addressing the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period or the two-parent notification requirement, particularly since none of the findings has been challenged in either this Court or the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Approximately one out of every two marriages ends in divorce.  648 F.Supp. 756, 768 (Minn.1986).  Unrebutted evidence indicates that only 50% of minors in the State of Minnesota reside with both biological parents.  <em>Ibid.;</em> App. 125-126.  This conclusion is substantially corroborated by a study indicating that 9% of the minors in Minnesota live with neither parent and 33% live with only one parent.  648 F.Supp. at 768. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 497 U. S. 438</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court found -- on the basis of extensive testimony at trial -- that the two-parent notification requirement had particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent when the parents were divorced or separated.  Relations between the minor and absent parent were not reestablished as a result of the forced notification, thereby often producing disappointment in the minor "when an anticipated reestablishment of her relationship with the absent parent d[id] not occur."  Moreover,</p>\n<p>"[t]he reaction of the custodial parent to the requirement of forced notification is often one of anger, resentment and frustration at the intrusion of the absent parent,"</p>\n<p>and fear that notification will threaten the custody rights of the parent or otherwise promote intra-family violence.  Tragically, those fears were often realized:</p>\n<p>"Involuntary involvement of the second biological parent is especially detrimental when the minor comes from an abusive, dysfunctional family.  Notification of the minor\'s pregnancy and abortion decision can provoke violence, even where the parents are divorced or separated.  Studies have shown that violence and harassment may continue well beyond the divorce, especially when children are involved."</p>\n<p>". . . Furthermore, a mother\'s perception in a dysfunctional family that there will be violence if the father learns of the daughter\'s pregnancy is likely to be an accurate perception."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 769.  The District Court further found:</p>\n<p>"Twenty to twenty-five percent of the minors who go to court either are accompanied by one parent who knows and consents to the abortion or have already told one parent of their intent to terminate their pregnancy.  The vast majority of these voluntarily informed parents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 497 U. S. 439</a></p><p> are women who are divorced or separated from spouses whom they have not seen in years.  Going to court to avoid notifying the other parent burdens the privacy of both the minor and the accompanying parent.  The custodial parents are angry that their consent is not sufficient, and fear that notification will bring the absent parent back into the family in an intrusive and abusive way."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court also found that the two-parent notification requirement had adverse effects in families in which the minor lives with both parents.  These effects were particularly pronounced in the distressingly large number of cases in which family violence is a serious problem.  The court found that many minors in Minnesota "live in fear of violence by family members" and "are, in fact, victims of rape, incest, neglect and violence." [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The District Court found that few minors can take advantage of the exception for a minor who declares that she is a victim of sexual or physical abuse because of the obligation to report the information to the authorities and the attendant loss of privacy.  <em>See</em> Findings 46 and 47, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 497 U. S. 440</a></p><p> 648 F.Supp. at 764. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  This concern about family violence helps to explain why the District Court found that in many instances the requirement that both parents be notified actually impairs family communication.  Minors who otherwise would inform one parent were unwilling to do so when such notification likely would also involve the parent in the torturous ordeal of explaining to a court why the second parent should not be notified.  The court found:</p>\n<p>"Minors who ordinarily would notify one parent may be dissuaded from doing so by the two-parent requirement.  A minor who must go to court for authorization in any event may elect not to tell either parent.  In these instances, the requirement that minors notify both biological parents actually reduces parent-child communication."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 769. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>The great majority of bypass petitions are filed in the three metropolitan counties in Minnesota, where courts schedule bypass hearings on a regular basis and have in place procedures for hearing emergency petitions.  <em>Id.</em> at 762.  Courts in the nonmetropolitan areas are acquainted with the statute and, for the most part, apply it conscientiously, but a number of counties are served by judges who are unwilling to hear bypass petitions.  <em>Id.</em> at 763.  Aside from the unavoidable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 497 U. S. 441</a></p><p> notification of court officials, the confidentiality of minors has been maintained.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>During the period between August 1, 1981, and March 1, 1986, 3,573 judicial bypass petitions were filed in Minnesota courts.  All but 15 were granted. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  The judges who adjudicated over 90% of these petitions testified; none of them identified any positive effects of the law. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The court experience produced fear, tension, anxiety, and shame among minors, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 497 U. S. 442</a></p><p> causing some who were mature, and some whose best interests would have been served by an abortion, to "forgo the bypass option and either notify their parents or carry to term."  Finding 44, 648 F.Supp. at 763.  Among parents who supported their daughters in the bypass proceedings, the court experience evoked similar reactions. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>Scheduling petitions in the Minnesota court typically required minors to wait only two or three days for hearings.  The District Court found, however, that the statutory waiting period of 48 hours was frequently compounded by a number of other factors that "commonly" created a delay of 72 hours, <em>id.</em> at 764-765, and, "in many cases" a delay of a week or more in effecting a decision to terminate a pregnancy.  <em>Id.</em> at 765.  A delay of that magnitude increased the medical risk associated with the abortion procedure to "a statistically significant degree."  Finding 43, 648 F.Supp. at 763.  While recognizing that a mandatory delay following the notice to a minor\'s parent served the State\'s interest in protecting pregnant minors, the court found that that interest could be served by a shorter waiting period.  <em>Id.</em> at 779-780.</p>\n<p>At least 37 witnesses testified to the issue whether the statute furthered the State\'s interest in protecting pregnant minors.  Only two witnesses testified that a two-parent notification statute did minors more good than harm; neither of these witnesses had direct experience with the Minnesota statute.  Summarizing its findings on the question whether the statute as a whole furthered the State\'s interests, the District Court wrote:</p>\n<p>"Of the remaining witnesses who spoke to the issue whether Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343 effectuates the State\'s interest in protecting pregnant minors, all but four of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 497 U. S. 443</a></p><p> these are personally involved in the statute\'s implementation in Minnesota.  They are judges, public defenders, guardians <em>ad litem,</em> and clinic counselors.  None of these witnesses testified that the statute has a beneficial effect upon the minors whom it affects.  Some testified the law has a negligible effect upon intra-family communication and upon the minors\' decisionmaking process.  Others testified the statute has a deleterious effect on the wellbeing of the minors to whom it applies because it increases the stress attendant to the abortion decision without creating any corresponding benefit.  Thus five weeks of trial have produced no factual basis upon which this court can find that Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(2)-(7) on the whole furthers in any meaningful way the state\'s interest in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 775.  Focusing specifically on the statutory requirement that both parents be notified, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<p>"The court finds that this requirement places a significant burden upon pregnant minors who do not live with both parents.  Particularly in these cases, notification of an abusive, or even a disinterested, absent parent has the effect of reintroducing that parent\'s disruptive or unhelpful participation into the family at a time of acute stress.  Similarly, the two-parent notification requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of minors in two-parent homes who voluntarily have consulted with one parent but not with the other out of fear of psychological, sexual, or physical abuse toward either the minor or the notified parent.  In either case, the alternative of going to court to seek authorization to proceed without notifying the second parent introduces a traumatic distraction into her relationship with the parent whom the minor has notified.  The anxiety attending either option tends to interfere with and burden the parent-child communication </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 497 U. S. 444</a></p><p> the minor voluntarily initiated with the custodial parent."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>". . . Indeed, 20 to 25% of minors seeking judicial authorization to proceed with an abortion without parental notification are accompanied to court by one parent, or at least have obtained the approval of one parent.  In these cases, the necessity either to notify the second parent despite the agreement of both the minor and the notified parent that such notification is undesirable, or to obtain a judicial waiver of the notification requirement, distracts the minor and her parent and disrupts their communication.  Thus, the need to notify the second parent or to make a burdensome court appearance actively interferes with the parent-child communication voluntarily initiated by the child, communication assertedly at the heart of the State\'s purpose in requiring notification of both parents.  In these cases, requiring notification of both parents affirmatively discourages parent-child communication."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 777-778.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Three separate but related interests -- the interest in the welfare of the pregnant minor, the interest of the parents, and the interest of the family unit -- are relevant to our consideration of the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period and the two-parent notification requirement.</p>\n<p>The State has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#634">443 U.

We have held that when a parent or another person has assumed "primary responsibility" for a minor\'s wellbeing, the State may properly enact "laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility."  <em>Ginsberg v.

To the extent that subdivision 2 of the Minnesota statute requires notification of only one parent, it does just that.  The brief waiting period provides the parent the opportunity to consult with his or her spouse and a family physician, and it permits the parent to inquire into the competency of the doctor performing the abortion, discuss the religious or moral implications of the abortion decision, and provide the daughter needed guidance and counsel in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 497 U.

Although the District Court found that scheduling factors, weather, and the minor\'s school and work commitments may combine, in many cases, to create a delay of a week or longer between the initiation of notification and the abortion, 648 F.Supp. at 765, there is no evidence that the 48-hour period itself is unreasonable or longer than appropriate for adequate consultation between parent and child.  The statute does not impose any period of delay once the parents or a court, acting <em>in loco parentis,</em> express their agreement that the minor is mature or that the procedure would be in her best interest.  Indeed, as the Court of Appeals noted and the record reveals, [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] the 48-hour waiting period may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the procedure, thus resulting in little or no delay.

S. 450</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is equally clear that the requirement that <em>both</em> parents be notified, whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed responsibility for the upbringing of the child, does not reasonably further any legitimate state interest.  The usual justification for a parental consent or notification provision is that it supports the authority of a parent who is presumed to act in the minor\'s best interest, and thereby assures that the minor\'s decision to terminate her pregnancy is knowing, intelligent, and deliberate.  To the extent that such an interest is legitimate, it would be fully served by a requirement that the minor notify one parent, who can then seek the counsel of his or her mate or any other party when such advice and support is deemed necessary to help the child make a difficult decision.  In the ideal family setting, of course, notice to either parent would normally constitute notice to both.  A statute requiring two-parent notification would not further any state interest in those instances.  In many families, however, the parent notified by the child would not notify the other parent.  In those cases, the State has no legitimate interest in questioning one parent\'s judgment that notice to the other parent would not assist the minor or in presuming that the parent who has assumed parental duties is incompetent to make decisions regarding the health and welfare of the child.</p>\n<p>Not only does two-parent notification fail to serve any state interest with respect to functioning families, it disserves the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with respect to dysfunctional families.  The record reveals that in the thousands of dysfunctional families affected by this statute, the two-parent notice requirement proved positively harmful to the minor and her family.  The testimony </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 497 U. S. 451</a></p><p> at trial established that this requirement, ostensibly designed for the benefit of the minor, resulted in major trauma to the child, and often to a parent as well.  In some cases, the parents were divorced and the second parent did not have custody or otherwise participate in the child\'s upbringing.  App. 244-245; <em>id.</em> at 466; <em>id.</em> at 115.  In these circumstances, the privacy of the parent and child was violated, even when they suffered no other physical or psychological harm.  In other instances, however, the second parent had either deserted or abused the child, <em>id.</em> at 462, 464, had died under tragic circumstances, <em>id.</em> at 120-121, or was not notified because of the considered judgment that notification would inflict unnecessary stress on a parent who was ill.  <em>Id.</em> at 204, 465. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  In these circumstances, the statute was not merely ineffectual in achieving the State\'s goals, but actually counterproductive.  The focus on notifying the second parent distracted both the parent and minor from the minor\'s imminent abortion decision.</p>\n<p>The State does not rely primarily on the best interests of the minor in defending this statute.  Rather, it argues that, in the ideal family, the minor should make her decision only </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 497 U. S. 452</a></p><p> after consultation with both parents, who should naturally be concerned with the child\'s welfare, and that the State has an interest in protecting the independent right of the parents "to determine and strive for what they believe to be best for their children."  Minn.Br. 26.  Neither of these reasons can justify the two-parent notification requirement.  The second parent may well have an interest in the minor\'s abortion decision, making full communication among all members of a family desirable in some cases, but such communication may not be decreed by the State.  The State has no more interest in requiring all family members to talk with one another than it has in requiring certain of them to live together.  In <em>Moore v. East Cleveland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html">431 U. S. 494</a></span> (1977), we invalidated a zoning ordinance which "slic[ed] deeply into the family itself," <em>id.</em> at 498, permitting the city to "standardiz[e] its children -- and its adults -- by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html#506">431 U. S. 506</a></span>.  Although the ordinance was supported by state interests other than the state interest in substituting its conception of family life for the family\'s own view, the ordinance\'s relation to those state interests was too "tenuous" to satisfy constitutional standards.  By implication, a state interest in standardizing its children and adults, making the "private realm of family life" conform to some state-designed ideal, is not a legitimate state interest at all.  <em>See also Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> 262 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/case.html#399">262 U. S. 399</a></span>-400 (right to establish a home and bring up children may not be interfered with by legislative action which is without "reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State to effect").</p>\n<p>Nor can any state interest in protecting a parent\'s interest in shaping a child\'s values and lifestyle overcome the liberty interests of a minor acting with the consent of a single parent or court.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html">443 U. S. 622</a></span> (1979); <em>Bellotti I,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976); <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html">428 U. S. 52</a></span> (1976).  In <em>Danforth,</em> the majority identified the only state interest in requiring parental consent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 497 U. S. 453</a></p><p> as that in "the safeguarding of the family unit and of parental authority," and held that that state interest was insufficient to support the requirement that mature minors receive parental consent.  The Court summarily concluded that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter\'s pregnancy is no more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#75">428 U. S. 75</a></span>.  It follows that the combined force of the separate interest of one parent and the minor\'s privacy interest must outweigh the separate interest of the second parent.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bellotti I</em> and <em>Bellotti II,</em> we also identified the difference between parental interests and the child\'s best interest.  Although the District Court invalidated the Massachusetts statute there under review on the grounds that it permitted a parent or the court, acting <em>in loco parentis,</em> to refuse consent based on the parent\'s own interests, the state Attorney General argued that the parental right consisted "<em>exclusively of the right to assess independently, for their minor child, what will serve that child\'s best interest.\'"  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html#144">428 U. S. 144</a></span>.  Because we believed that the Attorney General\'s interpretation "would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge," <em>id.</em> at 148, we ordered the District Court to certify the state-law question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html#151">428 U. S. 151</a></span>-152.  On review in this Court for the second time, after the Supreme Judicial Court stated unambiguously that the "good cause" standard required the judge to grant consent to an abortion found to be in the minor\'s best interest, 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#630">443 U.

Indeed, the constitutional defects that Justice Powell identified in the statute -- its failure to allow a minor who is found to be mature and fully competent to make the abortion </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 497 U. S. 454</a></em></p><p><em> decision independently and its requirement of parental consultation even when an abortion without notification would be in the minor\'s best interests -- are predicated on the assumption that the justification for any rule requiring parental involvement in the abortion decision rests entirely on the best interests of the child.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#651">443 U. S. 651</a></span>. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Minnesota two-parent notification requirement is an oddity among state and federal consent provisions governing the health, welfare, and education of children.  A minor desiring to enlist in the armed services or the Reserve Officers\' Training Corps (ROTC) need only obtain the consent of "his parent or guardian."  10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 505(a); 2104(b)(4); 2107(b)(4).  The consent of "a parent or guardian" is also sufficient to obtain a passport for foreign travel from the United States Department of State, 22 CFR \xc2\xa7 51.27 (1989), and to participate as a subject in most forms of medical research.  45 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 46.404, 46.405 (1988).  In virtually every State, the consent of one parent is enough to obtain a driver\'s license or operator\'s permit.  The same may be said with respect to the decision to submit to any medical or surgical procedure other than an abortion. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Indeed, the only other Minnesota statute that the State has identified which requires two-parent consent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 497 U. S. 455</a></p><p> is that authorizing the minor to change his name.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 32; Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 88-1309, p. 5 (citing Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7 259.10 (1988)).  These statutes provide testimony to the unreasonableness of the Minnesota two-parent notification requirement and to the ease with which the State can adopt less burdensome means to protect the minor\'s welfare.  <em>Cf. Clark v. Jeter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/456/case.html">486 U. S. 456</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/456/case.html#464">486 U. S. 464</a></span> (1988); <em>Turner v.

S. 98</a></span> (1987).  We therefore hold that this requirement violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VIII</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court holds that the constitutional objection to the two-parent notice requirement is removed by the judicial bypass option provided in subdivision 6 of the Minnesota statute.  I respectfully dissent from that holding.</p>\n<p>A majority of the Court has previously held that a statute requiring one parent\'s consent to a minor\'s abortion will be upheld if the State provides an</p>\n<p>"alternate procedure whereby a pregnant minor may demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests."</p>\n<p><em>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html">462 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#491">462 U. S. 491</a></span> (1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#505">462 U. S. 505</a></span> (opinion of O\'CONNOR, J.).  Indeed, in <em>Bellotti II,</em> four Members of the Court expressed the same opinion about a statute requiring the consent of both parents.  <em>See</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U. S. 643</a></span>-644.  Neither of those precedents should control our decision today.</p>\n<p>In <em>Bellotti II,</em> eight Members of the Court joined the judgment holding the Massachusetts statute unconstitutional.  Thus, the Court did not hold that the judicial bypass set forth in that statute was valid; it held just the opposite.  Moreover, the discussion of the minimum requirements for a valid judicial bypass in Justice Powell\'s opinion was joined by only four Members of the Court.  Indeed, neither the arguments of the parties, nor any of the opinions in the case, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 497 U. S. 456</a></p><p> considered the significant difference between a statute requiring the involvement of both parents in the abortion decision and a statute that merely requires the involvement of one.  Thus, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> does not require that the standards articulated in Justice Powell\'s opinion be applied to a statute that mandates the involvement of both parents.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Bellotti II,</em> the judgment in <em>Ashcroft</em> sustained the constitutionality of the statute containing a judicial bypass as an alternative to the requirement of one parent\'s consent to a minor\'s abortion.  The distinctions between notice and consent and between notification of both parents rather than just one arguably constitute a sufficient response to an argument resting on <em>stare decisis.</em>  Further analysis is necessary, however, because, at least on the surface, the consent requirement would appear to be more onerous than a requirement of mere notice.</p>\n<p>The significance of the distinction between a statute requiring the consent of one parent and a statute requiring notice to both parents must be tested by the relationship of the respective requirements to legitimate state interests.  We have concluded that the State has a strong and legitimate interest in providing a pregnant minor with the advice and support of a parent during the decisional period.  A general rule requiring the minor to obtain the consent of one parent reasonably furthers that interest.  An exception from the general rule is necessary to protect the minor from an arbitrary veto that is motivated by the separate concerns of the parent, rather than the best interest of the child.  <em>Cf. Parham v. J.R.,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/595/case.html#604">442 U. S. 604</a></span>-608.  But the need for an exception does not undermine the conclusion that the general rule is perfectly reasonable -- just as a rule requiring the consent of either parent for any other medical procedure would surely be reasonable if an exception were made for those emergencies in which, for example, a parent might deny life-saving </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 497 U. S. 457</a></p><p> treatment to a child on religious grounds.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/595/case.html#603">442 U. S. 602</a></span>-603.</p>\n<p>For reasons already set forth at length, a rule requiring consent or notification of both parents is not reasonably related to the state interest in giving the pregnant minor the benefit of parental advice.  The State has not called our attention to, nor am I aware of, any other medical situation in Minnesota or elsewhere in which the provision of treatment for a child has been conditioned on notice to, or consent by, both parents rather than just one.  Indeed, the fact that one-parent consent is the virtually uniform rule for any other activity which affects the minor\'s health, safety or welfare emphasizes the aberrant quality of the two-parent notice requirement.</p>\n<p>A judicial bypass that is designed to handle exceptions from a reasonable general rule, and thereby preserve the constitutionality of that rule, is quite different from a requirement that a minor -- or a minor and one of her parents -- must apply to a court for permission to avoid the application of a rule that is not reasonably related to legitimate state goals.  A requirement that a minor acting with the consent of both parents apply to a court for permission to effectuate her decision clearly would constitute an unjustified official interference with the privacy of the minor and her family.  The requirement that the bypass procedure must be invoked when the minor and one parent agree that the other parent should not be notified represents an equally unjustified governmental intrusion into the family\'s decisional process.  When the parents are living together and have joint custody over the child, the State has no legitimate interest in the communication between father and mother about the child.</p>\n<p>"[W]here the parents are divorced, the minor and/or custodial parent, and not a court, is in the best position to determine whether notifying the noncustodial parent would be in the child\'s best interests."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-1125, p. 69a.

Of the 38 States that require parental participation in the minor\'s decision to terminate her pregnancy, 27 make express that the participation of only one parent is required.  An additional three States, Idaho, Tennessee, and Utah, require an unmarried minor to notify "the parents or guardian" but do not specify whether "parents" refers to either member of the parental unit or whether notice to one parent constitutes constructive notice to both.  <em>See</em> Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 18-609(6) (1987); Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 39-15-202(f) (Supp.1989); Utah Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 76-7-304(2) (1990).  In contrast, Arkansas does require an unmarried minor to notify both parents but provides exceptions where the second parent "cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort," or a parent\'s "whereabouts are unknown," the parent has not been in contact with the minor\'s custodial parent or the minor for at least one year, or the parent is guilty of sexual abuse.  Ark.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2016-802, 20 16-808 (Supp. 1989).

Kentucky requires an unmarried minor to obtain the consent of a legal guardian or "both parents, if available," but provides that if both parents are not available, the consent of the available parent shall suffice.

Encouraging such discussion was intended to achieve several salutary results.  Parents can provide emotional support and guidance and thus forestall irrational and emotional decisionmaking.

In situations where the minor has a good relationship with the noncustodial parent but the custodial parent does not, there is nothing to prevent the minor from consulting with the noncustodial parent if she so desires.

The statute is ambiguous as to whether the term refers to each parent individually or rather to the parental unit, which could be represented by either the mother or the father, and neither the argument nor the discussion in <em>Matheson</em> indicated that notice to both parents was required.  State law, to the extent it addresses the issue, is to the contrary:  although Utah law provides that a noncustodial parent retains the right to consent to marriage, enlistment, and the performance of major medical or surgical treatment, the right to notice of the minor\'s abortion is not among the parent\'s specific residual rights and duties.

These numbers do not include incidents of psychological or sexual abuse, low-level physical abuse, abuse of any sort of the child of a batterer, or those incidents which are not reported.  Many minors in Minnesota live in fear of violence by family members; many of them are, in fact, victims of rape, incest, neglect and violence.  It is impossible to accurately assess the magnitude of the problem of family violence in Minnesota because members of dysfunctional families are characteristically secretive about such matters and minors are particularly reluctant to reveal violence or abuse in their families.

S. 450</a></span>-455, Minnesota\'s two-parent notification requirement is not even reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.  Therefore, that requirement surely would not pass the strict scrutiny applicable to restrictions on a woman\'s fundamental right to have an abortion.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the judgment of the Court in No. 89-1125, however, that the judicial bypass option renders the parental notification and 48-hour delay requirements constitutional.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#497">497 U.

S. 497</a></span>-501 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).  The bypass procedure cannot save those requirements because the bypass itself is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied.  At the very least, this scheme substantially burdens a woman\'s right to privacy without advancing a compelling state interest.  More significantly, in some instances it usurps a young woman\'s control over her own body by giving either a parent or a court the power effectively to veto her decision to have an abortion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court has consistently held since <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html">410 U.

As we reiterated in <em>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra,</em></p>\n<p>"Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman\'s decision -- with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in <em>Roe</em> -- whether to end her pregnancy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/747/case.html#772">476 U.

Accordingly, we have subjected state laws limiting that right to the most exacting scrutiny, requiring a State to show that such a law is narrowly drawn to serve a compelling interest.  <em>Roe, supra,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#155">410 U.

Indeed, today\'s decision reaffirms the vitality of <em>Roe,</em> as five Justices have voted to strike down a state law restricting a woman\'s right to have an abortion.  Accordingly, to be constitutional, state restrictions on abortion must meet the rigorous test set forth above.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I strongly disagree with the Court\'s conclusion that the State may constitutionally force a minor woman either to notify both parents (or in some cases only one parent [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]) and then wait 48 hours before proceeding with an abortion, or disclose her intimate affairs to a judge and ask that he grant her permission to have an abortion.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#497">497 U.

I base my conclusion not on my intuition about the needs and attitudes of young women, but on a sizable and impressive collection of empirical data documenting the effects of parental notification statutes and of delaying an abortion.  Second, the burdensome restrictions are not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling state interest.  Finally, for the reasons discussed in Part  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#472">497 U.

Although the Court considers the burdens that the two-parent notification requirement imposes on a minor woman\'s exercise of her right to privacy, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U. S. 450</a></span>-451, and n. 36, it fails to recognize that forced notification of only one parent also significantly burdens a young woman\'s right to have an abortion, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U.

Minors 15 years old or younger are even more likely voluntarily to discuss the abortion decision with their parents.  <em>Id.</em> at 290 (69% of such minors voluntarily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 497 U. S. 465</a></p><p> discuss abortion with parents).  For these women, the notification requirement by itself does not impose a significant burden.  But for those young women who would choose not to inform their parents, the burden is evident:  the notification requirement destroys their right to avoid disclosure of a deeply personal matter.  <em>Cf. Whalen v. Roe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/case.html">429 U.

S. 599</a></span>-600 (1977).</p>\n<p>A notification requirement can also have severe physical and psychological effects on a young woman.  First, forced notification of one parent, like forced notification of both parents, can be extremely traumatic for a young woman, depending on the nature of her relationship with her parents.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U. S. 450</a></span>-451, and n. 36.  The disclosure of a daughter\'s intention to have an abortion often leads to a family crisis, characterized by severe parental anger and rejection.  Osofsky &amp; Osofsky, Teenage Pregnancy:  Psychosocial Considerations, 21 Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology 1161 1164-1165 (1978).  The impact of any notification requirement is especially devastating for minors who live in fear of physical, psychological, or sexual abuse.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Clary, Minor Women Obtaining Abortions:  A Study of Parental Notification in a Metropolitan Area, 72 American J. of Pub. Health 283, 284 (1982) (finding that many minors chose not to inform parents voluntarily because of fear of negative consequences such as physical punishment or other retaliation).  <em>See also</em> Tr. 911 (testimony of Dr. Elissa Benedek) (stating that usually minors accurately predict parental reaction to news about daughters\' pregnancies).  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#438">497 U. S. 438</a></span>-440, and n. 25.  Certainly, child abuse is not limited to families with two parents.</p>\n<p>Second, the prospect of having to notify a parent causes many young women to delay their abortions, thereby increasing the health risks of the procedure.  <em>See</em> Cates, Schulz &amp; Grimes, The Risks Associated with Teenage Abortion, 309 New England J. of Medicine 621, 623 (1983) (finding that for women 19 years old and younger, the number of deaths per 100,000 abortions was 0.2 for the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 497 U.

The risks posed by this delay are especially significant because adolescents already delay seeking medical care until relatively late in their pregnancies, when risks are higher.  <em>See</em> 1 National Research Council, Risking the Future:  Adolescent Sexuality, Pregnancy, and Childbearing 114 (C. Hayes ed. 1987).</p>\n<p>In addition, a notification requirement compels many minors seeking an abortion to travel to a State without such a requirement to avoid notifying a parent.  Cartoof &amp; Klerman, Parental Consent for Abortion:  Impact of the Massachusetts Law, 76 American J. of Pub. Health 397, 399 (1986) (finding that one-third of minors seeking abortions traveled outside of State to avoid Massachusetts\' parental notice requirement).  Other women may resort to the horrors of self-abortion or illegal abortion rather than tell a parent.  Torres, Forrest, &amp; Eisman, <em>supra,</em> at 288 (9% of minors attending family planning clinics said they would have a self-induced or illegal abortion rather than tell a parent); <em>H.L. v.

Clearly, then, requiring notification of one parent significantly burdens a young woman\'s right to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\n<p>The 48-hour delay after notification further aggravates the harm caused by the pre-notification delay that may flow from a minor\'s fear of notifying a parent.

The District Court specifically found as a matter of fact that "[d]elay of any length in performing an abortion increases the statistical risk of mortality and morbidity."  648 F.Supp. 756, 765 (Minn 1986).  Even a brief delay can have a particularly detrimental impact if it pushes the abortion into the second trimester, when the operation is substantially more risky and costly.  <em>Ibid.

Moreover, the District Court found that the 48-hour delay</p>\n<p>"frequently is compounded by scheduling factors such as clinic hours, transportation requirements, weather, a minor\'s school and work commitments, and sometimes a single parent\'s family and work commitments,"</p>\n<p>often resulting in an effective delay of a week or more.  648 F.Supp. at 765.

The main purpose of the notification requirement is to</p>\n<p>"protect the wellbeing of minors by encouraging minors to discuss with their parents the decision whether to terminate their pregnancies"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 766.  The 44-hour delay, in turn, is designed to provide parents with adequate time to consult with their daughters.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U.

As Justice STEVENS states, such consultation is intended to ensure that the minor\'s decision is "knowing and intelligent."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U. S. 448</span>.  I need not determine whether the State\'s interest ultimately outweighs young women\'s privacy interests, however, because the strictures here are not closely tailored to further the State\'s asserted goal.</p>\n<p>For the many young women who would voluntarily consult with a parent before having an abortion, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#464">497 U. S. 464</a></span>-465, the notification and delay requirements are superfluous, and so do not advance the State\'s interest.  The requirements affect only those women who would not otherwise notify a parent.  But compelled notification is unlikely to result in productive consultation in families in which a daughter does not feel comfortable consulting her parents about intimate or sexual matters.  <em>See</em> Melton, Legal Regulation of Adolescent Abortion:  Unintended Effects, 42 American Psychologist 79, 81 (1987) (stating that, in many families, compelled parental notification is unlikely to result in meaningful discussion about the daughter\'s predicament); Tr. 1357-1358 (testimony of Dr. Steven Butzer) (stating that involuntary disclosure is disruptive to family and has "almost universally negative" effects, in accord with minor\'s expectations). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 497 U. S. 470</a></p><p>  Moreover, in those families with a history of child abuse, a pregnant minor forced to notify a parent is more likely to be greeted by physical assault or psychological harassment than open and caring conversation about her predicament.  <em>See</em> Tr. 316 (testimony of Dr. Lenore Walker) (stating that forced notification in dysfunctional families is likely to sever communication patterns and increase the risk of violence); <em>H.L. v.

Forced notification in such situations would amount to punishing the daughter for the lack of a stable and communicative family environment, when the blame for that situation lies principally, if not entirely, with the parents.  Parental notification in the less-than-ideal family, therefore, would not lead to an informed decision by the minor. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The State also claims that the statute serves the interest of protecting parents\' independent right "to shape the[ir] child[ren]\'s values and lifestyle[s]" and "to determine and strive for what they believe to be best for their children."  Brief for Petitioners in No. 88-1309, p. 26.  If this is so, the statute is surely under-inclusive, as it does not require parental notification where the minor seeks medical treatment for pregnancy, venereal disease, or alcohol and other drug abuse.  <em>See</em> Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(1) (1988).  Are we to believe that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 497 U.

Yet, ironically, the State\'s requirements here affirmatively interfere in family life by trying to force families to conform to the State\'s archetype of the ideal family.  <em>Cf. Moore v.

Parental authority is not limitless.  Certainly where parental involvement threatens to harm the child, the parent\'s authority must yield.  <em>Prince v.

S. 470</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the exercise of parental authority in some instances will take the form of obstructing the minor\'s decision to have an abortion.  A parent who objects to the abortion, once notified, can exert strong pressure on the minor -- in the form of stern disapproval, withdrawal of financial support, or physical or emotional abuse -- to block her from getting an abortion.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#647">443 U.

S. 74</a></span> ("[T]he State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient\'s pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent").  No person may veto any minor\'s decision, made in consultation with her physician, to terminate her pregnancy.  An "immature" minor has no less right to make decisions regarding her own body than a mature adult.</p>\n<p>Minnesota\'s bypass provision allows a judge to authorize an abortion if he determines either that a woman is sufficiently mature to make the decision on her own or, if she is not sufficiently mature, that an abortion without parental notification would serve her best interests.  Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(6) (1988).  Of course, if a judge refuses to authorize </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 497 U. S. 474</a></p><p> an abortion, a young woman can then reevaluate whether she wants to notify a parent.  But many women will carry the fetus to term rather than notify a parent.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#466">497 U. S. 466</a></span>-467.  Other women may decide to inform a parent, but then confront parental pressure or abuse so severe as to obstruct the abortion.  For these women, the judge\'s refusal to authorize an abortion effectively constitutes an absolute veto.</p>\n<p>The constitutional defects in any provision allowing someone to veto a woman\'s abortion decision are exacerbated by the vagueness of the standards contained in this statute.  The statute gives no guidance on how a judge is to determine whether a minor is sufficiently "mature" and "capable" to make the decision on her own.  <em>See</em> Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(6)(c)(i) (1988) (judge shall authorize abortion if he "determines that the pregnant woman is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion").  <em>Cf.</em> Lewis, 42 American Psychologist, at 84, 87 (noting the absence of a judicial standard for assessing maturity).  The statute similarly is silent as to how a judge is to determine whether an abortion without parental notification would serve an immature minor\'s "best interests."  \xc2\xa7 144.343(6)(c)(i) (judge shall authorize abortion for immature minor without notification "if said judge concludes that the pregnant woman\'s best interests would be served thereby").  Is the judge expected to know more about the woman\'s medical needs or psychological makeup than her doctor?  Should he consider the woman\'s financial and emotional status to determine the quality of life the woman and her future child would enjoy in this world?  Neither the record nor the Court answers such questions.  As Justice STEVENS wrote in <em>Bellotti II,</em> the best interest standard</p>\n<p>"provides little real guidance to the judge, and his decision must necessarily reflect personal and societal values and mores whose enforcement upon the minor -- particularly when contrary to her own informed and reasonable decision -- is fundamentally at odds with privacy interests underlying the constitutional protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 497 U. S. 475</a></p><p> afforded to her decision."</p>\n<p>443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#655">443 U. S. 655</a></span>-656 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  It is difficult to conceive of any reason, aside from a judge\'s personal opposition to abortion, that would justify a finding that an immature woman\'s best interests would be served by forcing her to endure pregnancy and childbirth against her will.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Even if I did not believe that a judicial bypass procedure was facially unconstitutional, the experience of Minnesota\'s procedure in operation demonstrates that the bypass provision before us cannot save the parental notification and delay requirements.  This Court has addressed judicial bypass procedures only in the context of facial challenges.  <em>See Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#490">462 U.

The Court has never considered the actual burdens a particular bypass provision imposes on a woman\'s right to choose an abortion.  Such consideration establishes that, even if judges authorized every abortion sought by petitioning minors, Minnesota\'s judicial bypass is far too burdensome to remedy an otherwise unconstitutional statute.</p>\n<p>The District Court found that the bypass procedure imposed significant burdens on minors.  First,</p>\n<p>"scheduling practices in Minnesota courts typically require minors to wait two or three days between their first contact with the court and the hearing on their petitions.  This delay may combine with other factors to result in a delay of a week or more."</p>\n<p>648 F.Supp. at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 497 U. S. 476</a></p><p> 763.  As noted above, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#467">497 U. S. 467</a></span>-468, a delay of only a few days can significantly increase the health risks to the minor; a week-long delay inevitably does.  Furthermore, in several counties in Minnesota, no judge is willing to hear bypass petitions, forcing women in those areas to travel long distances to obtain a hearing.  648 F.Supp. at 763; Donovan, Judging Teenagers:  How Minors Fare When They Seek Court-Authorized Abortions, 15 Family Planning Perspectives 259, 264 (1983) (50% of Minnesota minors utilizing bypass were not residents of city in which court was located); Melton, 42 American Psychologist, at 80 ("In Minnesota, where judges in rural counties have often recused themselves from participation in the abortion hearings, minors sometimes have to travel a round-trip of more than 500 miles for the hearing").  The burden of such travel, often requiring an overnight stay in a distant city, is particularly heavy for poor women from rural areas.  Furthermore, a young woman\'s absence from home, school, or work during the time required for such travel and for the hearing itself can jeopardize the woman\'s confidentiality.  <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court also found that the bypass procedure can be extremely traumatic for young women.</p>\n<p>"The experience of going to court for a judicial authorization produces fear and tension in many minors.  Minors are apprehensive about the prospect of facing an authority figure who holds in his hands the power to veto their decision to proceed without notifying one or both parents.  Many minors are angry and resentful at being required to justify their decision before complete strangers.  Despite the confidentiality of the proceeding, many minors resent having to reveal intimate details of their personal and family lives to these strangers.  Finally, many minors are left feeling guilty and ashamed about their lifestyle and their decision to terminate their pregnancy.  Some mature minors and some minors in whose best interests it is to proceed without notifying their parents are so daunted by the judicial proceeding that they forego the bypass option and either notify their parents or carry to term."</p>\n<p>"Some minors are so upset by the bypass proceeding that they consider it more difficult than the medical procedure itself.  Indeed the anxiety resulting from the bypass </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 497 U. S. 477</a></p><p> proceeding may linger until the time of the medical procedure and thus render the latter more difficult than necessary."</p>\n<p>648 F.Supp. at 763-764. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the substantial burdens imposed by these proceedings, the bypass is, in effect, a "rubber stamp," <em>id.</em> at 766 (testimony of Honorable William Sweeney); only an extremely small number of petitions are denied, <em>id.</em> at 765.  <em>See also</em> Melton, <em>supra,</em> at 80 ("Available research indicates that judicial bypass proceedings are merely <em>pro forma.</em>  Although they represent substantial intrusion on minors\' privacy and take up significant amounts of court time, there is no evidence that they promote more reasoned decisionmaking or screen out adolescents who may be particularly immature or vulnerable. . . .  The hearings typically last less than 15 minutes. . . .  Despite the complex issues involved (maturity and the best interests of the minor), experts are rarely if ever called to testify").  The judges who have adjudicated over 90% of the bypass petitions between 1981 and 1986 could not identify any positive effects of the bypass procedure.  <em>See</em> 648 F.Supp. at 766; <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#441">497 U. S. 441</a></span>-442, and n. 29.  The large number of women who undergo the bypass process do not receive any sort of counseling from the court -- which is not surprising, given the court\'s limited role and lack of expertise in that area.  The bypass process itself thus cannot serve the state interest of promoting informed decisionmaking by all minors.  If the State truly were concerned about ensuring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 497 U. S. 478</a></p><p> that all minors consult with a knowledgeable and caring adult, it would provide for some form of counseling rather than for a judicial procedure in which a judge merely gives or withholds his consent. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, regardless of one\'s view of the facial validity of a bypass procedure, Minnesota\'s procedure in practice imposes an excessive burden on young women\'s right to choose an abortion.  <em>Cf. Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#655">443 U. S. 655</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he need to commence judicial proceedings in order to obtain a legal abortion would impose a burden at least as great as, and probably greater than, that imposed on the minor child by the need to obtain the consent of a parent").  Furthermore, the process does not serve the State\'s interest of ensuring that minors\' decisions are informed.  Surely, then, a State could not require that all minor women seeking an abortion obtain judicial approval. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The Court\'s holding that the burdensome bypass procedure saves the State\'s burdensome notification and delay requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 497 U.

I cannot accept such a novel judicial calculus.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>A majority of the Court today strikes down an unreasonable and vastly overbroad requirement that a pregnant minor notify both her parents of her decision to obtain an abortion.  With that decision I agree.  At the same time, though, a different majority holds that a State may require a young woman to notify one or even both parents and then wait 48 hours before having an abortion, as long as the State provides a judicial bypass procedure.  From that decision I vehemently dissent.  This scheme forces a young woman in an already dire situation to choose between two fundamentally unacceptable alternatives:  notifying a possibly dictatorial or even abusive parent and justifying her profoundly personal decision in an intimidating judicial proceeding to a black-robed stranger.  For such a woman, this dilemma is more likely to result in trauma and pain than in an informed and voluntary decision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>1 concur in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U.

For instance, a woman might contact a clinic on Monday and find that her schedule and the clinic\'s allow for only a Tuesday appointment for that week.  Without the 48-hour delay requirement, the woman could be treated the next day; with the statutory delay, however, the woman would be forced to wait a week.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS concludes that the 48-hour delay requirement actually results in "little or no delay," because the statutory period "may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the procedure."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#449">497 U.

("48-hour waiting period . . . results in little or no delay"); 853 F.2d 1452, 1465 (CA8 1988) (en banc).  Justice STEVENS bases this conclusion on the testimony of the co-administrator of one abortion clinic that a one- or two-day scheduling backlog was typical.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#449">497 U.

Furthermore, that witness also stated that if "a woman says that she must be seen on a particular day, our policy is we will always see her."  App. 147.  But because of the mandated 48-hour delay, the clinic cannot honor a woman\'s request for an abortion until at least two full days have elapsed.

One will search in vain the document we are supposed to be construing for text that provides the basis for the argument over these distinctions, and will find in our society\'s tradition regarding abortion no hint that the distinctions are constitutionally relevant, much less any indication how a constitutional argument about them ought to be resolved.

Today the Court holds that a statute requiring a minor to notify both parents that she plans to have an abortion is not a permissible means of furthering the interest described with such specificity in <em>Bellotti II.</em>  This conclusion, which no doubt will come as a surprise to most parents, is incompatible with our constitutional tradition and any acceptable notion of judicial review of legislative enactments.  I dissent from the portion of the Court\'s judgment affirming the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that Minnesota two-parent notice statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Minnesota statute also provides, however, that if the two-parent notice requirement is invalidated, the same notice requirement is effective unless the pregnant minor obtains a court order permitting the abortion to proceed.  Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(6) (1988).  The Court of Appeals sustained this portion of the statute, in effect a two-parent notice requirement with a judicial bypass.  Five Members of the Court, the four who join this opinion and Justice O\'CONNOR, agree with the Court of Appeals\' decision on this aspect of the statute.  As announced by Justice STEVENS, who dissents from this part of the Court\'s decision, the Court of Appeals\' judgment on this portion of the statute is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The provisions of the statute before us are straightforward.  In essence, the statute provides that, before a physician in Minnesota may perform an abortion on an unemancipated minor, the physician or the physician\'s agent must notify both of the minor\'s parents, if each one can be located through reasonable effort, either personally or by certified mail at least 48 hours before the abortion is performed.  Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 144.343(2)-(3) (1988).  Notification is not required if the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor\'s death; or if both parents have consented to the abortion; or if the minor declares that she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse.  \xc2\xa7 144.343(4).  Failure to comply </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 497 U. S. 482</a></p><p> with these requirements is a misdemeanor, and the statute authorizes a civil action against the noncomplying physician by the minor\'s parents.  \xc2\xa7 144.343(5).</p>\n<p>The statute also provides that, if a court enjoins the notice requirement of subdivision 2, parental notice under the subdivision shall still be required unless the minor obtains a court order dispensing with it.  Under the statute, the court is required to authorize the physician to perform the abortion without parental notice if the court determines that the minor is "mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion" or that "the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parents, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests."  \xc2\xa7 144.343(6).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The State identifies two interests served by the law.  The first is the State\'s interest in the welfare of pregnant minors.  The second is the State\'s interest in acknowledging and promoting the role of parents in the care and upbringing of their children.  Justice STEVENS, writing for two Members of the Court, acknowledges the legitimacy of the first interest, but decides that the second interest is somehow illegitimate, at least as to whichever parent a minor chooses not to notify.  I cannot agree that the Constitution prevents a State from keeping both parents informed of the medical condition or medical treatment of their child under the terms and conditions of this statute.</p>\n<p>The welfare of the child has always been the central concern of laws with regard to minors.  The law does not give to children many rights given to adults, and provides, in general, that children can exercise the rights they do have only through and with parental consent.  <em>Parham v. J.R.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/584/case.html">442 U. S. 584</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/595/case.html#621">442 U.

Legislatures historically have acted on the basis of the qualitative differences in maturity between children and adults, <em>see Schall v.

Age is a rough but fair approximation of maturity and judgment, and a State has an interest in seeing that a child, when confronted with serious decisions such as whether or not to abort a pregnancy, has the assistance of her parents in making the choice.  If anything is settled by our previous cases dealing with parental notification and consent laws, it is this point.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#640">443 U.

The common law historically has given recognition to the right of parents, not merely to be notified of their children\'s actions, but to speak and act on their behalf.  Absent a showing of neglect or abuse, a father "possessed the paramount right to the custody and control of his minor children, and to superintend their education and nurture."  J. Schouler, Law of Domestic Relations 337 (3d. ed. 1882); <em>see also</em> 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *452-*453; 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *203-*206; G. Field, Legal Relations of Infants 63-80 (1888).  In this century, the common law of most States has abandoned the idea that parental rights are vested solely in fathers, with mothers being viewed merely as agents of their husbands, <em>cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#446">497 U.

Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, ch. 4, \xc2\xa7 18, p. 115 (5th ed. 1984).  Limitations have emerged on the prerogatives of parents to act contrary to the best interests of the child with respect to matters such as compulsory schooling and child labor.  As a general matter, however, it remains </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 497 U.

We have held that parents have a liberty interest, protected by the Constitution, in having a reasonable opportunity to develop close relations with their children.  <em>See Santosky v. Kramer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html">455 U.

We have recognized, of course, that there are limits to the constitutional right of parents to have custody of or to participate in decisions affecting their children.  If a parent has relinquished the opportunity to develop a relation with the child, and his or her only link to the child is biological, the Constitution does not require a State to allow parental participation.  <em>See Lehr v. Robertson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/248/case.html">463 U.

But the fact that the Constitution does not protect the parent-child relationship in all circumstances does not mean that the State cannot attempt to foster parental participation where the Constitution does not demand that it do so.  A State may seek to protect and facilitate the parent-child bond on the assumption that parents will act in their child\'s best interests.  <em>See Parham v. J.R., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/595/case.html#602">442 U. S. 602</a></span>-603; <em>Ginsberg v.

S. 485</a></p><p> we have held that a State cannot terminate parental rights based upon a presumption that a class of parents is unfit without affording individual parents an opportunity to rebut the presumption.  <em>See Stanley, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html#654">405 U.

S. 753</a></span> ("The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents . . .").  If a State cannot legislate on the broad assumption that classes of parents are unfit and undeserving of parental rights without affording an opportunity to rebut the assumption, it is at least permissible for a State to legislate on the premise that parents, as a general rule, are interested in their children\'s welfare and will act in accord with it.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s descriptions of the State\'s interests in this case are caricatures, both of the law and of our most revered institutions.  The Court labels these interests as ones in "standardizing its children and adults,".and in ensuring that each family, to the extent possible, "conform to some state-designed ideal."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#452">497 U.

S. 471</a></span> (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (accusing Minnesota of "trying to force families to conform to the State\'s archetype of the ideal family").  Minnesota asserts no such purpose, by explicit statement or by any permissible inference.  All that Minnesota asserts is an interest in seeing that parents know about a vital decision facing their child.  That interest is a valid one without regard to whether the child is living with either one or both parents, or to the attachment between the minor\'s parents.  How the family unit responds to such notice is, for the most part, beyond the State\'s control.  The State would no doubt prefer that all parents, after being notified under the statute, would contact their daughters and assist them in making their decisions with the child\'s best interests at heart; but it has not, contrary to the Court\'s intimation, "decreed" communication, nor could it.  What </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 497 U. S. 486</a></p><p> the State can do is make the communication possible by at least informing parents of their daughter\'s intentions.</p>\n<p>Minnesota has done no more than act upon the common-sense proposition that, in assisting their daughter in deciding whether to have an abortion, parents can best fulfill their roles if they have the same information about their own child\'s medical condition and medical choices as the child\'s doctor does; and that to deny parents this knowledge is to risk, or perpetuate, estrangement or alienation from the child when she is in the greatest need of parental guidance and support.  The Court does the State, and our constitutional tradition, sad disservice by impugning the legitimacy of these elemental objectives.</p>\n<p>Given the societal interest that underlies parental notice and consent laws, it comes as no surprise that most States have enacted statutes requiring that, in general, a physician must notify or obtain the consent of at least one of her parents or legal guardian before performing an abortion on a minor.  <em>See</em> Wardle, "Time Enough":  <em>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</em> and the Prudent Pace of Justice, 41 Fla.L.Rev. 881, 963-965 (1989) (collecting statutes).  Five States, including Minnesota, appear to require, as a general rule, the notification of both parents before a physician may perform an abortion on a minor.  <em>See</em> Ark.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 20-16-801 through 20-16-808  (Supp. 1989);  Idaho  Code \xc2\xa7 18-610(6)  (1987);  Tenn.Code  Ann. \xc2\xa7 39-4-202  (1982);  Utah  Code  Ann. \xc2\xa7 76-7-304 (1990).  Another six States appear to require, with varying exceptions, the consent of both parents.  <em>See</em> Del.Code Ann., Title 24, \xc2\xa7 1790(b)(3) (1987); Ill.Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \xef\xbf\xbd 81-54(3) (1989); Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 311.732 (Michie 1990); Mass. Gen.Laws \xc2\xa7 112, \xc2\xa7 12S (1988); Miss.Code. Ann. \xc2\xa7 41-41-53 (Supp.1989); N.D.Cent. Code \xc2\xa7 14-02.1-03.1 (1981).  Whether these statutes are more or less restrictive than the Minnesota statute is not the issue, although I pause to note that, because the Court\'s decision today turns upon its perception that the law\'s requirements, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 497 U. S. 487</a></p><p> despite its exceptions, are the most "stringent" in the country, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U. S. 459</span> (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), the Court\'s decision has no import for the validity of these other statutes.  What is important is that Minnesota is not alone in acknowledging the vitality of these governmental interests and adopting laws that, in the legislature\'s judgment, are best suited to serving them while protecting the minor\'s welfare.</p>\n<p>On a more general level, the current trend among state legislatures is to enact joint custody laws making it the norm for divorced or separated parents to share the legal responsibility and authority for making decisions concerning their children\'s care, education, religion, and medical treatment.  <em>See</em> 2 H. Clark, Law of Domestic Relations in the United States \xc2\xa7 20.5 (2d ed. 1987); Folberg, Joint Custody Law --  The Second Wave, 23 J.Family L. 1, 14-55 (1984-1985) (collecting statutes).  Under Minnesota law, for example, there exists a presumption in divorce proceedings that joint custody, if requested by either or both parents, is in the best interests of the child.  <em>See</em> Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 518.17(2) (Supp.1989).  Even if joint custody is not awarded, Minnesota law provides that each parent, unless the court specifically directs otherwise to protect the welfare of a parent or the child,</p>\n<p>"has the right of access to, and to receive copies of, school, medical, dental, religious training, and other important records and information about the minor children;"</p>\n<p>the responsibility to "keep the other party informed as to the name and address of the school of attendance of the minor children"; the responsibility to "notify the other party of [an accident or serious illness of a minor child], and the name of the health care provider and the place of treatment"; and "the right to reasonable access and telephone contact with the minor children."  Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 518.17(3) (1988).  Minnesota\'s two-parent notification law does no more than apply these general principles to the specific case of abortion. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 497 U. S. 488</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Federal law contains similar provisions regulating the health and welfare of children that require the notification or consent of both parents.  For example, one condition for obtaining a grant under the Adolescent Family Life Act is that an applicant must provide assurances that it will</p>\n<p>"notify the parents or guardians of any unemancipated minor requesting services [relating to family planning] from the applicant and . . . will obtain the permission of such parents or guardians with respect to the provision of such services."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300z-5(a)(22)(A)(i)  (1982  ed.); <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 300z-5(a)(22)(A)(ii) (requiring only notice to parents or guardians if the unemancipated minor is pregnant).  <em>See also</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 5671(d) (1982 ed., Supp. V) (authorizing funding for certain experimental juvenile drug and alcohol treatment programs if safeguards are established for obtaining the informed consent of the "parents or guardians" of minors); 50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 454(c)(4) (1982 ed.) (permitting induction of 17-year-olds into the Armed Forces with the written consent of his "parents or guardian"); 45 CFR \xc2\xa7 46.408 (1989) (requiring consent of both parents before a minor may participate in medical research posing more than a "minimal" risk of harm).  With all respect, I submit the Court today errs when it states that Minnesota\'s two-parent notice law is an "oddity among state and federal consent provisions."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#454">497 U. S. 454</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>At least two Members of the Court concede, as they must, that a State has a legitimate interest in the welfare of the pregnant minor and that, in furtherance of this interest, the State may require the minor to notify, and consult with, one of her parents.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#444">497 U. S. 444</a></span>-446 (opinion of STEVENS, J.); <em>cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#469">497 U. S. 469</a></span> (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).  The Court nonetheless holds the Minnesota statute unconstitutional because it requires the minor to notify not one parent, but both parents, a requirement that the Court says bears </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 497 U. S. 489</a></p><p> no reasonable relation to the minor\'s welfare.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U.

S. 469</a></span>-472 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).  The Court also concludes that Minnesota does not have a legitimate interest in facilitating the participation of both parents in the care and upbringing of their children.  Given the substantial protection that minors have under Minnesota law generally, and under the statute in question, the judicial bypass provisions of the law are not necessary to its validity.  The two-parent notification law enacted by Minnesota is, in my view, valid without the judicial bypass provision of subdivision 6.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We have been over much of this ground before.  It is beyond dispute that in many families, whether the parents are living together or apart, notice to both parents serves the interests of the parents and the minor, and that the State can legislate with this fact in mind.  In <em>H.L. v. Matheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html">450 U. S. 398</a></span> (1981), we considered the constitutionality of a statute which required a physician, before performing an abortion on a minor, to "<em>[n]otify, if possible, the [minor\'s] <em>parents</em> or guardian.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#400">450 U. S. 400</a></span> (quoting Utah Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 76-7-304 (1978)) (emphasis added).  We held that the statute, as applied to unmarried, dependent, and immature minors,\n</em></p>\n<p>"plainly serves important state interests, is narrowly drawn to protect only those interests, and does not violate any guarantees of the Constitution."</p>\n<p>450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#413">450 U. S. 413</a></span>.  Our holding was made with knowledge of the contentions, supported by citations to medical and sociological literature, that are proffered again today for the proposition that notification imposes burdens on minors.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#436">450 U. S. 436</a></span>-441 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  We nonetheless rejected arguments that a requirement of parental notification was the equivalent of a requirement of parental consent, <em>id.</em> at 411; that the statute was unconstitutional because it required notification only as to abortions, and not as to other medical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 497 U. S. 490</a></p><p> procedures, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#412">450 U. S. 412</a></span>; and that the statute was unconstitutional because it might deter some minors from seeking abortions, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#413">450 U. S. 413</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Our decision was based upon the well-accepted premise that we must defer to a reasonable judgment by the state legislature when it determines what is sound public policy.  Justice STEVENS\'s opinion concurring in the Court\'s judgment relied upon an explicit statement of this principle.  Concluding that the Utah statute requiring notification of both parents was valid as to all unmarried minors, both mature and immature, Justice STEVENS reasoned that the State\'s interest in ensuring that a young woman considering an abortion receive appropriate consultation was "plainly sufficient to support a state legislature\'s determination that such appropriate consultation should include parental advice."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#423">450 U. S. 423</a></span>.  The Court today departs from this rule.  It now suggests that a general requirement that both parents be notified is unconstitutional because of its own conclusion that the law is unnecessary when notice produces favorable results, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U. S. 450</a></span>, and irrational in all of the instances when it produces unfavorable results, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#450">497 U. S. 450</a></span>-451.  In <em>Matheson,</em> Justice STEVENS rejected these same arguments as insufficient to establish that the Utah statute was unconstitutional:</p>\n<p>"Of course, a conclusion that the Utah statute is invalid would not prevent young pregnant women from voluntarily seeking the advice of their parents prior to making the abortion decision.  But the State may legitimately decide that such consultation should be made more probable by ensuring that parents are informed of their daughter\'s decision[.]"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Utah\'s interest in its parental-notice statute is not diminished by the fact that there can be no guarantee that meaningful parent-child communication will actually occur.  Good-faith compliance with the statute\'s requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 497 U. S. 491</a></p><p> would tend to facilitate communication between daughters and parents regarding the abortion decision.  <em>The possibility that some parents will not react with compassion and understanding upon being informed of their daughter\'s predicament or that, even if they are receptive, they will incorrectly advise her, does not undercut the legitimacy of the State\'s attempt to establish a procedure that will enhance the probability that a pregnant young woman exercise as wisely as possible her right to make the abortion decision.</em>"</p>\n<p>450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#423">450 U.

Justice STEVENS\' reasoning was correct then and it remains correct today.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In applying the standards established in our prior decisions to the case at hand,</p>\n<p>"we must keep in mind that when we are concerned with extremely sensitive issues, such as the one involved here, "the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature.

The Minnesota Legislature, like the legislatures of many States, has found it necessary to address the issue of parental notice in its statutory laws.  In my view it has acted in a permissible manner.</p>\n<p>All must acknowledge that it was reasonable for the legislature to conclude that, in most cases, notice to both parents will work to the minor\'s benefit.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#640">443 U. S. 640</a></span>, n. 20 (parental involvement, if compassionate and supportive, is highly desirable).  This is true not only in what the Court calls the "ideal family setting," where both parents and the minor live under one roof, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 497 U. S. 492</a></p><p> but also where the minor no longer lives with both parents.  The Court does not deny that many absent parents maintain significant ties with their children, and seek to participate in their lives, to guide, to teach, and to care for them.  It is beyond dispute that these attachments, in cases not involving mistreatment or abuse, are essential to the minor\'s wellbeing, and that parental notice is supportive of this kind of family tie.  Although it may be true that notice to one parent will often result in notice to both, the State need not rely upon the decision of one parent to notify the other, particularly where both parents maintain ties with their daughter but not with each other, and when both parents share responsibilities and duties with respect to the child.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge that, in some cases, notifying both parents will not produce desirable results despite the fact that no actual instance is in the record before us, as the two-parent notification requirement was enjoined before it went into effect.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#438">497 U. S. 438</a></span> (stating as a matter of historical fact that the "two-parent notification requirement <em>had</em> particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent" and that fears that notification of an absent parent would produce harmful results "<em>were</em> often realized") (emphasis added).  We need not decide today, however, whether the Constitution permits a State to require that a physician notify both biological parents before performing an abortion on any minor, for the simple reason that Minnesota has not enacted such a law.</p>\n<p>The Minnesota statute in fact contains exceptions to ensure that the statutory notice requirement does not apply if it proves a serious threat to the minor\'s health or safety.  First, the statute does not require notice at all costs; to comply with the law, a physician need only use "reasonably diligent effort" to locate and notify both of the minor\'s parents.  If the second parent cannot be located, as may be the case if the parent has deserted the family or ceased to maintain contact with the minor or the other parent, the only notice required is to the first parent.   Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(3) (1988). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 497 U. S. 493</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, even where both parents can be located, notice is not required if the physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to prevent the woman\'s death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice, \xc2\xa7 144.343(4)(a); if the minor\'s parents have authorized the abortion in writing, \xc2\xa7 144.343(4)(b); or if the minor declares that she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse, \xc2\xa7 144.343(4)(c).  Under Minnesota law, "neglect" of a minor means the failure of a parent</p>\n<p>"to supply a child with necessary food, clothing, shelter or medical care when reasonably able to do so or failure to protect a child from conditions or actions which imminently and seriously endanger the child\'s physical or mental health when reasonably able to do so,"</p>\n<p>Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 626.556(2)(c) (Supp.1989); physical abuse is defined as "any physical injury inflicted by a person responsible for the child\'s care on a child other than by accidental means," \xc2\xa7 626.556(2)(d); and sexual abuse includes any sexual contact by a parent or other person responsible for the child\'s care or in a position of authority with respect to the child.  \xc2\xa7 626.556(2)(a).  I cannot believe that these exceptions are too narrow to eliminate from the statute\'s coverage those instances in which notice would place the minor in danger of parental violence or other conduct that is a real threat to the physical or mental health of the child.</p>\n<p>The Court challenges the efficacy of this last exception because it believes that the statutory requirement that a physician report a minor\'s declaration of abuse to appropriate authorities, <em>see</em> \xc2\xa7 144.343(4)(c), will deter minors from using the exception.  This is not a proper basis for declaring the law invalid.  Laws are not declared unconstitutional because of some general reluctance to follow a statutory scheme the legislature finds necessary to accomplish a legitimate state objective.  Beyond any question, it is reasonable for the State to require that physicians report declarations of abuse to ensure that mistreatment is known to authorities responsible for the protection of minors.  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 497 U. S. 494</a></p><p> requirement is but a single manifestation of the broad duty in Minnesota to report suspected cases of child abuse to the proper authorities.  <em>See</em> Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 626.556(1) (1988) (declaring it to be the public policy of the State "to protect children whose health or welfare may be jeopardized through physical abuse, neglect or sexual abuse" and "to strengthen the family and make the home, school, and community safer for children by promoting responsible child care in all settings").</p>\n<p>No one can contend that a minor who is pregnant is somehow less deserving of the State\'s protection.  It is reasonable to provide that any minor who contends that she cannot notify her parent or parents because she is the victim of neglect or abuse allow the State to use its power to investigate her declaration and protect her from harm.  Any parent, moreover, who responds to notice by threatening or harming the minor or the other parent may be prosecuted by the State to the full extent of its laws.  <em>See</em> Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 518B.01 (1988) (Domestic Abuse Act); Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 609.221, 609.222, 609.223, 609.224 (1988 and Supp. 1989) (assault statutes);  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 609.341 through 609.345 (sexual abuse statutes); \xc2\xa7 609.378 (criminal neglect statute).  Just as it relies upon such laws as its first line of defense for dealing with all other instances of abuse in family situations, so too is the State entitled to rely upon them here.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the exceptions and protections we have discussed, it does remain possible, of course, that in some instances notifying one or both parents will not be in the minor\'s best interests.  Allegations of a similar possibility, based upon sociological evidence similar to that presented in this case, was made by the appellant in <em>Matheson.</em> <em>See</em> Brief for Appellant 10-11; Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., <em>et al.,</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 1631 in <em>Matheson,</em> O.T.1980, No. 79-5903.  The Court there held that the parental notification law was valid, at least as to immature minors, for the simple reason that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 497 U. S. 495</a></p><p> law is not invalid if it fails to further the governmental interest in every instance.  This point formed the cornerstone of Justice STEVENS\'s concurring opinion in <em>Matheson, see</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#423">450 U. S. 423</a></span>-424, and it finds its most explicit statement in the Court\'s opinion in <em>Parham v. J.R.,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/595/case.html#602">442 U. S. 602</a></span>-603:</p>\n<p>"The law\'s concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\'s difficult decisions.  More importantly, historically, it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children. . . . "</p>\n<p>"As with so many other legal presumptions, experience and reality may rebut what the law accepts as a starting point; the incidence of child neglect and abuse cases attest to this.  That some parents may at times be acting against the best interests of their children . . . creates a basis for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child\'s best interests."</p>\n<p>The only cases in which a majority of the Court has deviated from this principle are those in which a State sought to condition a minor\'s access to abortion services upon receipt of her parent\'s consent to do so.  In <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html">428 U. S. 52</a></span> (1976), the Court invalidated a Missouri law requiring that a physician obtain the consent of one parent before performing an abortion.  The Court\'s reasoning was unmistakable:</p>\n<p>"[T]he State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient\'s pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#74">428 U. S. 74</a></span>.  The Court today, ignoring this statement, relies heavily upon isolated passages from <em>Danforth, see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#452">497 U.

Justice MARSHALL, on the other hand, expressly equates laws requiring parental consent with laws requiring parental notification, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#471">497 U.

Unlike parental consent laws, a law requiring parental notice does not give any third party the legal right to make the minor\'s decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortion should she choose to have one performed.  We have acknowledged this distinction as "fundamental," and as one "substantially modify[ing] the federal constitutional challenge."  <em>Bellotti v.

The statute before us, including the 48-hour waiting period, which is necessary to enable notified parents to consult with their daughter or their daughter\'s physician, if they so wish, and results in little or no delay, represents a permissible, reasoned attempt to preserve the parents\' role in a minor\'s decision to have an abortion without placing any absolute obstacles before a minor who is determined to elect an abortion for her own interest as she sees it.  Section 144.343, without the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 497 U. S. 497</a></p><p> judicial bypass provision of subdivision 6, is constitutional.  I would reverse the contrary judgment of the Court. of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because a majority of the Court holds that the two-parent notice requirement contained in subdivision 2 is unconstitutional, it is necessary for the Court to consider whether the same notice requirement is constitutional if the minor has the option of obtaining a court order permitting the abortion to proceed in lieu of the required notice.  Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 144.343(6) (1988).  Assuming, as I am bound to do for this part of the analysis, that the notice provisions standing alone are invalid, I conclude that the two-parent notice requirement with the judicial bypass alternative is constitutional.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that Minnesota\'s two-parent notice law without a judicial bypass is unconstitutional because of the possibility that, in some cases, the rule would not work to the benefit of minors or their parents.  If one were to attempt to design a statute that would address the Court\'s concerns, one would do precisely what Minnesota has done in \xc2\xa7 144.343(6):  create a judicial mechanism to identify, and exempt from the strictures of the law, those cases in which the minor is mature or in which notification of the minor\'s parents is not in the minor\'s best interests.  The bypass procedure comports in all respects with our precedents.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U.

The simple fact is that our decision in <em>Bellotti II</em> stands for the proposition that a two-parent consent law is constitutional if it provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 497 U. S. 498</a></p><p> for a sufficient judicial bypass alternative, and it requires us to sustain the statute before us here.  In <em>Bellotti II,</em> the Court considered the constitutionality of a statute which required a physician to obtain, in most circumstances, the consent of both of a minor\'s parents before performing an abortion on the minor.  <em>See</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#625">443 U. S. 625</a></span>-626 (citing Mass.Gen.Laws. Ann., ch. 112, \xc2\xa7 12S (West Supp.1979)).  Although eight Members of the Court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional, five indicated that they would uphold a two-parent consent statute with an adequate judicial bypass.</p>\n<p>For four of the eight Justices forming the majority in <em>Bellotti II,</em> the failure of the statute lay in its inadequate bypass procedure, not its requirement that both of the minor\'s parents consent to the abortion.  <em>See</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U. S. 643</a></span> (opinion of Powell, J.).  Justice Powell\'s opinion specifically stated that</p>\n<p>"if the State decides to require a pregnant minor to obtain <em>one or both</em> parents\' consent to an abortion, it also must provide an alternative procedure whereby authorization for the abortion can be obtained,"</p>\n<p><em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added), and then stated the minimum requirements for such a procedure.  In response to the dissent\'s contention that his opinion was advisory, Justice Powell stated that the four Members of the Court thought it necessary</p>\n<p>"to provide some guidance as to how a State constitutionally may provide for adult involvement -- either by parents or a state official such as a judge -- in the abortion decision of minors.  In view of the importance of the issue raised, and the protracted litigation to which these parties already have been subjected, we think it would be irresponsible simply to invalidate [the Massachusetts law] without stating our views as to the controlling principles."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#652">443 U.

S. 499</a></p><p> cannot be left with nothing more than the guidance offered by a truly fragmented holding of this Court").</p>\n<p>Justice WHITE dissented from the Court\'s judgment that the Massachusetts statute was unconstitutional.  In his view, no bypass was necessary, so it must follow that a two-parent consent statute with an adequate bypass procedure would have been valid.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#656">443 U. S. 656</a></span>-657 (dissenting opinion).  In sum, five Members of the Court in <em>Bellotti II</em> found, either by express statement or by implication, that it was permissible under the Constitution for a State to require the consent of two parents, as long as it provides a consent substitute in the form of an adequate judicial bypass procedure.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept Justice STEVENS\' suggestion today that the plurality, in announcing these rules, did not "consider" the fact that it was doing so in the context of a two-parent consent requirement, <em>see ante</em> at 34.  The statute was explicit in its command that both parents consent to the abortion.  <em>See</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#625">443 U. S. 625</a></span>-626.  The plurality indicated that it was aware of this fact, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#630">443 U. S. 630</a></span>, and n. 10, and the dissent drew a specific contrast between the two-parent consent requirement then before the Court and the one-parent consent requirement before the Court in Danforth.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#653">443 U. S. 653</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  Aware of all of these circumstances, the plurality stated the controlling principles with specific reference to laws requiring the consent of "one or both" parents.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U. S. 643</a></span>.  The plurality\'s considered reasoning, coupled with the dissenting views of Justice WHITE, was intended to set forth the dispositive principles of law for deciding the constitutionality of parental consent laws.  The Court has relied upon these principles in deciding the constitutionality of laws requiring notice or the consent of one parent, <em>see Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#439">462 U. S. 439</a></span>-442 (consent); <em>Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/502/case.html#511">497 U. S. 511</a></span>-514 (notice).  As <em>Bellotti II</em> dealt with the far more demanding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 497 U. S. 500</a></p><p> requirement of two-parent consent, and approved of such a requirement when coupled with a judicial bypass alternative, I must conclude that these same principles validate a two-parent notice requirement when coupled with a judicial bypass alternative.</p>\n<p>A second precedent that compels the conclusion that a two-parent notice law with a judicial bypass alternative is constitutional is our decision in <em>Matheson.</em>  There we held that a two-parent notice statute without a bypass was constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests would be served by notice.  Like the statute before the Court in <em>Matheson,</em> the Minnesota statute, as amended by subdivision 6, requires a physician to notify the parents of those immature minors whose best interest will be served by the communication.</p>\n<p>If a two-parent notification law may be constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests are served by the law, but not as applied to minors who are mature or whose best interests are not so served, a judicial bypass is an expeditious and efficient means by which to separate the applications of the law which are constitutional from those which are not.  Justice STEVENS\' characterization of the judicial bypass procedure discussed in our past cases as a necessary "exception" to a "reasonable general rule," such as a one-parent consent requirement, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#456">497 U. S. 456</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/417/case.html#457">497 U. S. 457</a></span>, is far off the mark.  If a judicial bypass is mandated by the Constitution at all, it must be because a general consent rule is unreasonable in at least some of its applications, and the bypass is necessary to save the statute.  <em>See, e.g., Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U. S. 643</a></span>; Matheson, 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#420">450 U. S. 420</a></span> (Powell, J., concurring).  No reason can be given for refusing to apply a similar analysis to the less demanding case of a notice statute.  It follows that a similar result should obtain:  a law that requires notice to one or both parents is constitutional with a bypass.  I thus concur in that portion of the judgment announced, but not agreed with, by Justice STEVENS </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 497 U. S. 501</a></p><p> which affirms the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that \xc2\xa7 144.343(6) is constitutional.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In this case, the Court rejects a legislature\'s judgment that parents should at least be aware of their daughter\'s intention to seek an abortion, even if the State does not empower the parents to control the child\'s decision.  That judgment is rejected, although it rests upon a tradition of a parental role in the care and upbringing of children that is as old as civilization itself.  Our precedents do not permit this result.</p>\n<p>It is true that, for all too many young women, the prospect of two parents, perhaps even one parent, sustaining her with support that is compassionate and committed is an illusion.  Statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by parents and documentations of child neglect and mistreatment are but fragments of the evidence showing the tragic reality that becomes day-to-day life for thousands of minors.  But the Court errs in serious degree when it commands its own solution to the cruel consequences of individual misconduct, parental failure, and social ills.  The legislative authority is entitled to attempt to meet these wrongs by taking reasonable measures to recognize and promote the primacy of the family tie, a concept which this Court now seems intent on declaring a constitutional irrelevance.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
