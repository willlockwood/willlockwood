DUTRA CONSTR. CO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">STEWART <em>v.</em> DUTRA CONSTRUCTION CO.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93814.Argued November 1, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 22, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">As part of a project to extend the Massachusetts Turnpike, respondent Dutra Construction Company dug a trench beneath Boston Harbor using its dredge, the <em>Super Scoop</em>, a floating platform with a bucket that removes silt from the ocean floor and dumps it onto adjacent scows.  The <em>Super Scoop</em> has limited means of self-propulsion, but can navigate short distances by manipulating its anchors and cables.  When dredging the trench here, it typically moved once every couple of hours.  Petitioner, a marine engineer hired by Dutra to maintain the <em>Super Scoop</em>\xe2\x80\x99s mechanical systems, was seriously injured while repairing a scow\xe2\x80\x99s engine when the <em>Super Scoop</em> and the scow collided.  He sued Dutra under the Jones Act, alleging that he was a seaman injured by Dutra\xe2\x80\x99s negligence, and under \xc2\xa75(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7905(b), which authorizes covered employees to sue a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d owner as a third party for an injury caused by the owner\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.  The District Court granted Dutra summary judgment on the Jones Act claim, and the First Circuit affirmed.  On remand, the District Court granted Dutra summary judgment on the LHWCA claim.  In affirming, the First Circuit noted that Dutra had conceded that the <em>Super Scoop</em> was a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7905(b), but found that Dutra\xe2\x80\x99s alleged negligence had been committed in its capacity as an employer and not as the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s owner. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A dredge is a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under the LHWCA.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove the bar to negligence suits by seamen.  Although that Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9cseaman,\xe2\x80\x9d the maritime law backdrop at the time it was passed shows that \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art with an established meaning under general maritime law.  The LHWCA, enacted in 1927 to provide scheduled compensation to land-based maritime workers but not to \xe2\x80\x9ca master or member of a crew of any vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(3)(G), works in tandem with the Jones Act: The Jones Act provides tort remedies to sea-based maritime workers and the LHWCA provides workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation to land-based maritime employees.  In <em>McDermott Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilander,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/337/index.html">498 U. S. 337</a>, and <em>Chandris, Inc.</em> v. <em>Latsis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/347/index.html">515 U. S. 347</a>, this Court addressed the relationship a worker must have to a vessel in order to be a \xe2\x80\x9cmaster or  member\xe2\x80\x9d of its crew.  Now the Court turns to the other half of the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s equation: determining whether a watercraft is a vessel.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The LHWCA did not define \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d when enacted, but \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 3 of the Revised Statutes of 1873 specified that, in any Act passed after February 25, 1871, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99 includes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  The LHWCA is such an Act.    Section 3\xe2\x80\x99s definition has remained virtually unchanged to the present and continues to supply the default definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the U. S. Code.  Section 3 merely codified the meaning \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d had acquired in general maritime law.  In fact, prior to the passage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA, this Court and lower courts had treated dredges as vessels.  By the time those Acts became law in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, it was settled that \xc2\xa73 defined \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for their purposes, and that a structure\xe2\x80\x99s status as a vessel under \xc2\xa73 depended on whether the structure was an instrument of naval transportation.  See <em>Ellis</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/246/index.html">206 U. S. 246</a>, 259.  Then as now, dredges served a waterborne transportation function: In performing their work they carried machinery, equipment, and a crew over water.  This Court has continued to treat \xc2\xa73 as defining \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA and to construe \xc2\xa73 consistently with general maritime law.  <em>Norton</em> v. <em>Warner Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/565/index.html">321 U. S. 565</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Cope</em> v. <em>Vallette Dry Dock Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/625/index.html">119 U. S. 625</a>, and <em>Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co.</em> v. <em>Chero Cola Bottling Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/271/19/index.html">271 U. S. 19</a>, did not adopt a definition of vesselhood narrower than \xc2\xa73.  Rather, they made a sensible distinction between watercraft temporarily stationed in a particular location and those permanently anchored to shore or the ocean floor.  A watercraft is not capable of being used for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.  By including special-purpose vessels like dredges, \xc2\xa73 sweeps broadly, but other prerequisites to qualifying for seaman status under the Jones Act provide some limits.  A worker seeking such status must prove that his duties contributed to the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s function or mission and that his connection to the vessel was substantial in nature and duration.  <em>Chandris, supra, </em>at 376.  Pp.  10\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The First Circuit held that the <em>Super Scoop</em> is not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d because its primary purpose is not navigation or commerce and because it was not in actual transit at the time of Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  Neither prong of that test is consistent with \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s text or general maritime law\xe2\x80\x99s established meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 3 requires only that a watercraft be \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\xe2\x80\x9d not that it be used primarily for that purpose.  The <em>Super Scoop</em> was not only \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d to transport equipment and passengers over water\xe2\x80\x94it was so used.   Similarly, requiring a watercraft to be in motion to qualify as a vessel under \xc2\xa73 is the sort of \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot\xe2\x80\x9d test rejected in <em>Chandris</em>.  That a vessel must be \xe2\x80\x9cin navigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chandris, supra, </em>at 373\xe2\x80\x93374, means not that a structure\xe2\x80\x99s locomotion at any given moment matters, but that structures may lose their character as vessels if withdrawn from the water for an extended period.  The \xe2\x80\x9cin navigation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is thus relevant to whether a craft is \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used,\xe2\x80\x9d for naval transportation.  The inquiry whether a craft is \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used,\xe2\x80\x9d for maritime transportation may involve factual issues for a jury, but here no relevant facts were in dispute.  Dutra conceded that the <em>Super Scoop</em> was only temporarily stationary while the scow was being repaired; it had not been taken out of service, permanently anchored, or otherwise rendered practically incapable of maritime transport.  Finally, Dutra conceded that the <em>Super Scoop</em> is a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7905(b), which imposes LHWCA liability on vessel owners for negligence to longshoremen.  However, the LHWCA does not meaningfully define the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in either \xc2\xa7902(3)(G) or \xc2\xa7905(b), and 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73 defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the LHWCA.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(3)(G).  We hold that it is.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As part of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Central Artery/Tunnel Project, or \xe2\x80\x9cBig Dig,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook to extend the Massachusetts Turnpike through a tunnel running beneath South Boston and Boston Harbor to Logan Airport.  The Commonwealth employed respondent Dutra Construction Company to assist in that undertaking.  At the time, Dutra owned the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest dredge, the <em>Super Scoop</em>, which was capable of digging the 50-foot-deep, 100-foot-wide, three-quarter-mile-long trench beneath Boston Harbor that is now the Ted Williams Tunnel.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Super Scoop</em> is a massive floating platform from which a clamshell bucket is suspended beneath the water.  The bucket removes silt from the ocean floor and dumps the sediment onto one of two scows that float alongside the dredge.  The <em>Super Scoop</em> has certain characteristics common to seagoing vessels, such as a captain and crew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining area.  But it lacks others.  Most conspicuously, the <em>Super Scoop</em> has only limited means of self-propulsion.  It is moved long distances by tugboat.  (To work on the Big Dig, it was towed from its home base in California through the Panama Canal and up the eastern seaboard to Boston Harbor.)  It navigates short distances by manipulating its anchors and cables.  When dredging the Boston Harbor trench, it typically moved in this way once every couple of hours, covering a distance of 30-to-50 feet each time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dutra hired petitioner Willard Stewart, a marine engineer, to maintain the mechanical systems on the <em>Super Scoop</em> during its dredging of the harbor.  At the time of Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s accident, the <em>Super Scoop</em> lay idle because one of its scows, Scow No. 4, had suffered an engine malfunction and the other was at sea.  Stewart was on board Scow No. 4, feeding wires through an open hatch located about 10 feet above the engine area.  While Stewart was perched beside the hatch, the <em>Super Scoop</em> used its bucket to move the scow.  In the process, the scow collided with the <em>Super Scoop</em>, causing a jolt that plunged Stewart headfirst through the hatch to the deck below.  He was seriously injured.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stewart sued Dutra in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under the Jones Act, 38 Stat. 1185, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa7688(a), alleging that he was a seaman injured by Dutra\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.  He also filed an alternative claim under \xc2\xa75(b) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7905(b), which authorizes covered employees to sue a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d owner as a third party for an injury caused by the owner\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dutra moved for summary judgment on the Jones Act claim, arguing that Stewart was not a seaman.  The company acknowledged that Stewart was \xe2\x80\x9ca member of the <em>[Super Scoop</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em>]</em> crew,\xe2\x80\x9d 230 F. 3d 461, 466 (CA1 2000); that he spent \xe2\x80\x9c[n]inety-nine percent of his time while on the job\xe2\x80\x9d aboard the <em>Super Scoop</em>, App. 20 (Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment); and that his \xe2\x80\x9cduties contributed to the function\xe2\x80\x9d of the <em>Super Scoop</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 32.  Dutra argued only that the <em>Super Scoop</em> was not a vessel for purposes of the Jones Act.  Dutra pointed to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 en banc decision in <em>DiGiovanni</em> v. <em>Traylor Brothers, Inc.</em>, 959 F. 2d 1119 (CA1 1992), which held that \xe2\x80\x9cif a barge \xe2\x80\xa6 or other float\xe2\x80\x99s purpose or primary business is <em>not</em> navigation or commerce, then workers assigned thereto for its shore enterprise are to be considered seamen only when it is in actual navigation or transit\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1123 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court granted summary judgment to Dutra, because the <em>Super Scoop</em>\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose was dredging rather than transportation and because it was stationary at the time of Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that it too was bound by <em>DiGiovanni</em>.  230 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 467\xe2\x80\x93468.  The court reasoned that the <em>Super Scoop</em>\xe2\x80\x99s primary function was construction and that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny navigation or transportation that may be required is incidental to this primary function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 468.  The court also concluded that the scow\xe2\x80\x99s movement at the time of the accident did not help Stewart, because his status as a seaman depended on the movement of the <em>Super Scoop</em> (which was stationary) rather than the scow.  <em>Id.</em>, at 469.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Dutra on Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s alternative claim that Dutra was liable for negligence as an owner of a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under the LHWCA, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7905(b).  The Court of Appeals again affirmed.  It noted that Dutra had conceded that the <em>Super Scoop</em> was a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7905(b), explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98significantly more inclusive than that used for evaluating seaman status under the Jones Act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  343 F. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 2003) (quoting <em>Morehead</em> v. <em>Atkinson-Kiewit</em>, 97 F. 3d 603, 607 (CA1 1996) (en banc)).  The Court of Appeals nonetheless agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Dutra\xe2\x80\x99s alleged negligence was committed in its capacity as an employer rather than as owner of the vessel under \xc2\xa7905(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve confusion over how to determine whether a watercraft is a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the LHWCA.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1177/index.html">540 U. S. 1177</a> (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to the passage of the Jones Act, general maritime law usually entitled a seaman who fell sick or was injured both to maintenance and cure (or the right to be cared for and paid wages during the voyage, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Harden</em> v. <em>Gordon</em>, 11 F. Cas. 480, 482\xe2\x80\x93483 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823) (Story, J.)), and to damages for any \xe2\x80\x9cinjuries received . . . in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>The Osceola,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/189/158/index.html">189 U. S. 158</a>, 175 (1903).  Suits against shipowners for negligence, however, were barred.  Courts presumed that the seaman, in signing articles of employment for the voyage, had assumed the risks of his occupation; thus a seaman was \xe2\x80\x9cnot allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member of the crew.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove this bar to negligence suits by seamen.  See <em>Chandris, Inc.</em> v. <em>Latsis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/347/index.html">515 U. S. 347</a>, 354 (1995).  Specifically, the Jones Act provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa7688(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAlthough the statute is silent on who is a \xe2\x80\x9cseaman,\xe2\x80\x9d both the maritime law backdrop against which Congress enacted the Jones Act and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent enactments provide some guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art that had an established meaning under general maritime law.  We have thus presumed that when the Jones Act made available negligence remedies to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress took the term \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d as the general maritime law found it.  <em>Chandris</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 355 (citing <em>Warner</em> v. <em>Goltra,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/155/index.html">293 U. S. 155</a>, 159 (1934)); G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, Law of Admiralty \xc2\xa76\xe2\x80\x9321, pp. 328\xe2\x80\x93329 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Congress provided further guidance in 1927 when it enacted the LHWCA, which provides scheduled compensation to land-based maritime workers but which also excepts from its coverage \xe2\x80\x9ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(3)(G).  This exception is simply \xe2\x80\x9ca refinement of the term \xe2\x80\x98seaman\xe2\x80\x99 in the Jones Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McDermott Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilander,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/337/index.html">498 U. S. 337</a>, 347 (1991).  Thus the Jones Act and the LHWCA are complementary regimes that work in tandem: The Jones Act provides tort remedies to <em>sea</em>-based maritime workers, while the LHWCA provides workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation to <em>land</em>-based maritime employees.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>Swanson</em> v. <em>Marra Brothers, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/1/index.html">328 U. S. 1</a>, 6\xe2\x80\x937 (1946).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, discerning the contours of \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d status, even with the general maritime law and the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s language as aids to interpretation, has not been easy.  See <em>Chandris,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 356.  We began clarifying the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d in a pair of cases, <em>McDermott Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilander,</em> <em>supra</em>, and <em>Chandris</em>, <em>supra</em>, that addressed the relationship a worker must have to a vessel in order to be a \xe2\x80\x9cmaster or member\xe2\x80\x9d of its crew.  We now turn to the other half of the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s equation: how to determine whether a watercraft is a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just as Congress did not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d in the Jones Act,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] it did not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA itself.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  However, Congress provided a definition elsewhere.  At the time of the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 3 of the Revised Statutes of 1873 specified:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn determining the meaning of the revised statutes, or of any act or resolution of Congress passed subsequent to February twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he word \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99 includes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  18 Stat., pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSections 1 and 3 show that, because the LHWCA is an Act of Congress passed after February 25, 1871, the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cincludes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3\xe2\x80\x99s definition, repealed and recodified in 1947 as part of the Rules of Construction Act, 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, has remained virtually unchanged from 1873 to the present.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Even now, \xc2\xa73 continues to supply the default definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the U. S. Code, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the context indicates otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  The context surrounding the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment indicates that \xc2\xa73 defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3 merely codified the meaning that the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d had acquired in general maritime law.  See 1 S. Friedell, Benedict on Admiralty \xc2\xa7165 (rev. 7th ed. 2004).  In the decades following its enactment, \xc2\xa73 was regularly used to define the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in maritime jurisprudence.  Taking only the issue presented here\xe2\x80\x94whether a dredge is a vessel\xe2\x80\x94prior to passage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA, courts often used \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s definition to conclude that dredges were vessels.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the very beginning, these courts understood the differences between dredges and more traditional seagoing vessels.  Though smaller, the dredges at issue in the earliest cases were essentially the same as the <em>Super Scoop</em> here.  For instance, the court could have been speaking equally of the <em>Super Scoop</em> as of <em>The Alabama</em> when it declared:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe dredge and scows have no means of propulsion of their own except that the dredge, by use of anchors, windlass, and rope, is moved for short distances, as required in carrying on the business of dredging.  Both the dredge and the scows are moved from place to place where they may be employed by being towed, and some of the tows have been for long distances and upon the high seas.  The dredge and scows are not made for or adapted to the carriage of freight or passengers, and the evidence does not show that, in point of fact, this dredge and scows had ever been so used and employed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Alabama</em>, 19 F. 544, 545 (SD Ala. 1884).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>Huismann</em> v. <em>The Pioneer</em>, 30 F. 206 (EDNY 1886).  None of this prevented the court from recognizing that dredges are vessels because they are watercraft with \xe2\x80\x9cthe capacity to be navigated in and upon the waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Alabama</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 546; see also <em>The Pioneer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 207; <em>The International</em>, 89 F. 484, 485 (CA3 1898).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court also treated dredges as vessels prior to the passage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA.  It did so in a pair of cases, first implicitly in <em>The \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia Ehrman\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cAgnese,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/97/309/index.html">97 U. S. 309</a> (1878), and then explicitly in <em>Ellis</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/206/246/index.html">206 U. S. 246</a> (1907).  In <em>Ellis</em>, this Court considered, <em>inter alia</em>, whether workers aboard various dredges and scows were covered by a federal labor law.  Just as in the present case, one of the <em>Ellis</em> appellants argued that the dredges at issue were \xe2\x80\x9cvessels\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa73, now 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73.  206 U. S., at 249.  The United States responded that dredges were only vessels, if at all, when in actual navigation as they were \xe2\x80\x9ctowed from port to port.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 253.  Citing \xc2\xa73, Justice Holmes rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he scows and floating dredges were vessels\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwere within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 259.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These early cases show that at the time Congress enacted the Jones Act and the LHWCA in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, it was settled that \xc2\xa73 defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of those statutes.  It was also settled that a structure\xe2\x80\x99s status as a vessel under \xc2\xa73 depended on whether the structure was a means of maritime transportation.  See R. Hughes, Handbook of Admiralty Law \xc2\xa75, p. 14 (2d ed. 1920).  For then, as now, dredges served a waterborne transportation function, since in performing their work they carried machinery, equipment, and crew over water.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Butler</em> v. <em>Ellis</em>, 45 F.\xc2\xa02d 951, 955 (CA4 1930) (finding the vessel status of dredges \xe2\x80\x9csustained by the overwhelming weight of authority\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>The Hurricane</em>, 2 F.\xc2\xa02d 70, 72 (ED Pa. 1924) (expressing \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that dredges are vessels), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 9 F.\xc2\xa02d 396 (CA3 1925).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have continued to treat \xc2\xa73 as defining the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA, and they have continued to construe \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s definition in light of the term\xe2\x80\x99s established meaning in general maritime law.  For instance, in <em>Norton</em> v. <em>Warner Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/565/index.html">321 U. S. 565</a> (1944), the Court considered whether a worker on a harbor barge was \xe2\x80\x9ca master or member of a crew of any vessel\xe2\x80\x9d under the LHWCA, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(3)(G).  In finding that the \xe2\x80\x9cbarge [was] a vessel within the meaning of the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court not only quoted \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel,\xe2\x80\x9d but it also cited in support of its holding several earlier cases that had held dredges to be vessels based on the general maritime law.  321 U. S., at 571, and n. 4.  This Court therefore confirmed in <em>Norton</em> that \xc2\xa73 defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA and that \xc2\xa73 should be construed consistently with the general maritime law.  Since <em>Norton</em>, this Court has often said that dredges and comparable watercraft qualify as vessels under the Jones Act and the LHWCA.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa73 in cases like <em>Ellis</em> and <em>Norton</em>, Dutra argues that the Court has implicitly narrowed \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  Section 3 says that a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 Stat., pt. 1, p. 1.  In a pair of cases, the Court held that a drydock, <em>Cope</em> v. <em>Vallette Dry Dock Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/625/index.html">119 U. S. 625</a>, 630 (1887), and a wharfboat attached to the mainland, <em>Evansville &amp; Bowling Green Packet Co.</em> v. <em>Chero Cola Bottling Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/271/19/index.html">271 U. S. 19</a>, 22 (1926), were not vessels under \xc2\xa73, because they were not <em>practically</em> capable of being used to transport people, freight, or cargo from place to place.  According to Dutra, <em>Cope</em> and <em>Evansville</em> adopted a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d narrower than \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dutra misreads <em>Cope</em> and <em>Evansville</em>.  In <em>Cope</em>, the plaintiff sought a salvage award for having prevented a drydock from sinking after a steamship collided with it.  119 U. S., at 625\xe2\x80\x93626.  At the time of the accident, the drydock, a floating dock used for repairing vessels, was \xe2\x80\x9cmoored and lying at [the] usual place\xe2\x80\x9d it had occupied for the past 20 years.  <em>Id.</em>, at 626.  In those circumstances, the drydock was a \xe2\x80\x9cfixed structure\xe2\x80\x9d that had been \xe2\x80\x9cpermanently moored,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a vessel that had been temporarily anchored.  <em>Id.</em>, at 627.  <em>Evansville</em> involved a wharfboat secured by cables to the mainland.  Local water, electricity, and telephone lines all ran from shore to the wharfboat, evincing a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent location.\xe2\x80\x9d  271 U. S., at 22.  And the wharfboat, like the drydock in <em>Cope</em>, was neither \xe2\x80\x9ctaken from place to place\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cused to carry freight from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x9d 271 U. S., at 22.  As in <em>Cope</em>, the Court concluded that the wharfboat \xe2\x80\x9cwas not practically capable of being used as a means of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  271 U. S., at 22.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Cope</em> and <em>Evansville</em> did no more than construe \xc2\xa73 in light of the distinction drawn by the general maritime law between watercraft temporarily stationed in a particular location and those permanently affixed to shore or resting on the ocean floor.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>The Alabama</em>, 19 F., at 546 (noting that vessels possess \xe2\x80\x9cmobility and [the] capacity to navigate,\xe2\x80\x9d as distinct from fixed structures like wharves, drydocks, and bridges).  Simply put, a watercraft is not \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This distinction is sensible: A ship and its crew do not move in and out of Jones Act coverage depending on whether the ship is at anchor, docked for loading or unloading, or berthed for minor repairs, in the same way that ships taken permanently out of the water as a practical matter do not remain vessels merely because of the remote possibility that they may one day sail again.  See <em>Pavone</em> v. <em>Mississippi Riverboat Amusement Corp.</em>, 52 F.\xc2\xa03d 560, 570 (CA5 1995) (floating casino was no longer a vessel where it \xe2\x80\x9cwas moored to the shore in a semi-permanent or indefinite manner\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kathriner</em> v. <em>Unisea, Inc.</em>, 975 F.\xc2\xa02d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was no longer a vessel where a \xe2\x80\x9clarge opening [had been] cut into her hull,\xe2\x80\x9d rendering her incapable of moving over the water).  Even if the general maritime law had not informed the meaning of \xc2\xa73, its definition would not sweep within its reach an array of fixed structures not commonly thought of as capable of being used for water transport.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen interpreting a statute, we must give words their \xe2\x80\x98ordinary or natural\xe2\x80\x99 meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 228 (1993))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying \xc2\xa73 brings within the purview of the Jones Act the sorts of watercraft considered vessels at the time Congress passed the Act.  By including special-purpose vessels like dredges, \xc2\xa73 sweeps broadly, but the other prerequisites to qualifying for seaman status under the Jones Act provide some limits, notwithstanding \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s breadth.  A maritime worker seeking Jones Act seaman status must also prove that his duties contributed to the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s function or mission, and that his connection to the vessel was substantial both in nature and duration.  <em>Chandris</em>, 515 U. S., at 376.  Thus, even though the <em>Super Scoop</em> is a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel,\xe2\x80\x9d workers injured aboard the <em>Super Scoop</em> are eligible for seaman status only if they are \xe2\x80\x9cmaster[s] or member[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of its crew.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, relying on its previous en banc decision in <em>DiGiovanni</em> v. <em>Traylor Brothers, Inc.</em>, 959 F. 2d 1119 (CA1 1992), held that the <em>Super Scoop</em> is not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel,\xe2\x80\x9d because its primary purpose is not navigation or commerce and because it was not in actual transit at the time of Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  230 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 468\xe2\x80\x93469.  Neither prong of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 test is consistent with the text of \xc2\xa73 or the established meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in general maritime law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3 requires only that a watercraft be \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water\xe2\x80\x9d to qualify as a vessel.  It does not require that a watercraft be used <em>primarily</em> for that purpose.  See<em> The Alabama</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 546; <em>The International</em>, 89 F., at 485.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the <em>Super Scoop</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunction was to move through Boston Harbor, \xe2\x80\xa6 digging the ocean bottom as it moved.\xe2\x80\x9d  343 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 12.  In other words, the <em>Super Scoop</em> was not only \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d to transport equipment and workers over water\xe2\x80\x94it <em>was</em> used to transport those things.  Indeed, it could not have dug the Ted Williams Tunnel had it been unable to traverse the Boston Harbor, carrying with it workers like Stewart.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also, a watercraft need not be in motion to qualify as a vessel under \xc2\xa73.  Looking to whether a watercraft is motionless or moving is the sort of \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot\xe2\x80\x9d test that we rejected in <em>Chandris</em>.  Just as a worker does not \xe2\x80\x9coscillate back and forth between Jones Act coverage and other remedies depending on the activity in which the worker was engaged while injured,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chandris</em>, 515 U. S., at 363, neither does a watercraft pass in and out of Jones Act coverage depending on whether it was moving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granted, the Court has sometimes spoken of the requirement that a vessel be \xe2\x80\x9cin navigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 373\xe2\x80\x93374, but never to indicate that a structure\xe2\x80\x99s locomotion at any given moment mattered.  Rather, the point was that structures may lose their character as vessels if they have been withdrawn from the water for extended periods of time.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>Roper</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/20/index.html">368 U. S. 20</a>, 21, 23 (1961); <em>West</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/118/index.html">361 U. S. 118</a>, 122 (1959).  The Court did not mean that the \xe2\x80\x9cin navigation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement stood apart from \xc2\xa73, such that a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa73 might nevertheless not be a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel in navigation\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Jones Act or the LHWCA.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Templeton</em>, 378 F.\xc2\xa03d 845, 851 (CA8 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he definition of \xe2\x80\x98vessel in navigation\xe2\x80\x99 under the Jones Act is not as expansive as the general definition of \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the \xe2\x80\x9cin navigation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is an element of the vessel status of a watercraft.  It is relevant to whether the craft is \xe2\x80\x9cused, or capable of being used\xe2\x80\x9d for maritime transportation.  A ship long lodged in a drydock or shipyard can again be put to sea, no less than one permanently moored to shore or the ocean floor can be cut loose and made to sail.  The question remains in all cases whether the watercraft\xe2\x80\x99s use \xe2\x80\x9cas a means of transportation on water\xe2\x80\x9d is a practical possibility or merely a theoretical one.  <em>Supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In some cases that inquiry may involve factual issues for the jury, <em>Chandris</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373, but here no relevant facts were in dispute.  Dutra conceded that the <em>Super Scoop</em> was only temporarily stationary while Stewart and others were repairing the scow; the <em>Super Scoop</em> had not been taken out of service, permanently anchored, or otherwise rendered practically incapable of maritime transport.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, although Dutra argues that the <em>Super Scoop</em> is not a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7902(3)(G), which is the LHWCA provision that excludes seamen from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage, Dutra conceded below that the <em>Super Scoop</em> <em>is</em> a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7905(b), which is the LHWCA provision that imposes liability on vessel owners for negligence to longshoremen.  The concession was necessary because the Court of Appeals had previously held that \xc2\xa7905(b)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significantly more inclusive than that used for evaluating seaman status under the Jones Act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  343 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 13 (quoting <em>Morehead</em> v. <em>Atkinson-Kiewit</em>, 97 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 607).  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach is no longer tenable.  The LHWCA does not meaningfully define the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in either \xc2\xa7902(3)(G) or \xc2\xa7905(b), see n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>, and 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73 defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the LHWCA.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time that Congress enacted the LHWCA and since, Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa73, now 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, has defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA.  Under \xc2\xa73, a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d is any watercraft practically capable of maritime transportation, regardless of its primary purpose or state of transit at a particular moment.  Because the <em>Super Scoop</em> was engaged in maritime transportation at the time of Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s injury, it was a vessel within the meaning of 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73.  Despite the seeming incongruity of grouping dredges alongside more traditional seafaring vessels under the maritime statutes, Congress and the courts have long done precisely that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t seems a stretch of the imagination to class the deck hands of a mud dredge in the quiet waters of a Potomac creek with the bold and skillful mariners who breast the angry waves of the Atlantic; but such and so far-reaching are the principles which underlie the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty that they adapt themselves to all the new kinds of property and new sets of operatives and new conditions which are brought into existence in the progress of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saylor</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 77 F. 476, 479 (CA4 1896).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Shipping Act of 1916 defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Jones Act.

However, the provision of the Jones Act at issue here, \xc2\xa7688(a), speaks not of \xe2\x80\x9cvessels,\xe2\x80\x9d but of \xe2\x80\x9cseamen.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any event, because we have identified a Jones Act \xe2\x80\x9cseaman\xe2\x80\x9d with reference to the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion, see 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(3)(G) (\xe2\x80\x9ca master or member of a crew of any vessel\xe2\x80\x9d), it is the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d that matters.  And, as we explain, the context surrounding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of the LHWCA suggests that Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa73, now 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73, provides the controlling definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As part of its 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA, Congress amended the Act with what appears at first blush to be a definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cUnless the context requires otherwise, the term \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99 means any vessel upon which or in connection with which any person entitled to benefits under this chapter suffers injury or death arising out of or in the course of his employment, and said vessel\xe2\x80\x99s owner, owner pro hac vice, agent, operator, charter or bare boat charterer, master, officer, or crew member.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(21).  However, Congress enacted this definition in conjunction with the third-party vessel owner provision of \xc2\xa7905(b).  Rather than specifying the characteristics of a vessel, \xc2\xa7902(21) instead lists the parties liable for the negligent operation of a vessel.  See <em>McCarthy</em> v. <em>The Bark Peking</em>, 716 F. 2d 130, 133 (CA2 1983) (\xc2\xa7902(21) is \xe2\x80\x9ccircular\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not provide precise guidance as to what is included within the term \xe2\x80\x98vessel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Congress had used substantially the same definition before, first in an 1866 antismuggling statute, see \xc2\xa71, 14 Stat. 178, and then in an 1870 statute \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] for the Relief of sick and disabled Seamen,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77, 16 Stat. 170.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0During the 1947 codification, the hyphen was removed from the word \xe2\x80\x9cwatercraft.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73, 61 Stat. 633.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>The Alabama</em>, 19 F. 544, 546 (SD Ala. 1884) (dredge was a vessel and subject to maritime liens); <em>Huismann</em> v. <em>The Pioneer</em>, 30 F. 206, 207 (EDNY 1886) (dredge was a vessel under \xc2\xa73); <em>Saylor</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 77 F. 476, 477 (CA4 1896) (dredge was a vessel under \xc2\xa73, and its workers were seamen); <em>The International</em>, 89 F. 484, 484\xe2\x80\x93485 (CA3 1898) (dredge was a vessel under \xc2\xa73); <em>Eastern S.
