ROE<br/>\n543 U. S. ____ (2004)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA et\xc2\xa0al. \n<em>v.</em> JOHN ROE</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931669.Decided December 6, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer, respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity.  The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts.  Respondent brought suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent John Roe, a San Diego police officer, made a video showing himself stripping off a police uniform and masturbating.  He sold the video on the adults-only section of eBay, the popular online auction site.  His user name was \xe2\x80\x9cCodestud3@aol.com,\xe2\x80\x9d a word play on a high priority police radio call.  356 F.\xc2\xa03d 1108, 1110 (CA9 2004).  The uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police, but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform.  Roe also sold custom videos, as well as police equipment, including official uniforms of the San Diego Police Department (SDPD), and various other items such as men\xe2\x80\x99s underwear.  Roe\xe2\x80\x99s eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Roe\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor, a police sergeant, discovered Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities when, while on eBay, he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an individual with the username \xe2\x80\x9cCodestud3@aol.com.\xe2\x80\x9d  He searched for other items Codestud3 offered and discovered listings for Roe\xe2\x80\x99s videos depicting the objectionable material.  Recognizing Roe\xe2\x80\x99s picture, the sergeant printed images of certain of Roe\xe2\x80\x99s offerings and shared them with others in Roe\xe2\x80\x99s chain of command, including a police captain.  The captain notified the SDPD\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs department, which began an investigation.  In response to a request by an undercover officer, Roe produced a custom video.  It showed Roe, again in police uniform, issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the uniform and masturbating.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The investigation revealed that Roe\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated specific SDPD policies, including conduct unbecoming of an officer, outside employment, and immoral conduct.  When confronted, Roe admitted to selling the videos and police paraphernalia.  The SDPD ordered Roe to \xe2\x80\x9ccease displaying, manufacturing, distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar behaviors, via the internet, U. S. Mail, commercial vendors or distributors, or any other medium available to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  356 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although Roe removed some of the items he had offered for sale, he did not change his seller\xe2\x80\x99s profile, which described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as the prices for custom videos.  After discovering Roe\xe2\x80\x99s failure to follow its orders, the SDPD\xe2\x80\x94citing Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful orders\xe2\x80\x94began termination proceedings.  The proceedings resulted in Roe\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal from the police force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Roe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech.  In granting summary judgment to the City, the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing, marketing, and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic concern\xe2\x80\x9d under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Connick</em> v. <em>Myers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html">461 U. S. 138</a> (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reversing, the Court of Appeals held Roe\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern.  Central to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion was that Roe\xe2\x80\x99s expression was not an internal workplace grievance, took place while he was off-duty and away from his employer\xe2\x80\x99s premises, and was unrelated to his employment.  356 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1110, 1113\xe2\x80\x931114.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment.  See<em>, e.g., Keyishian</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/589/index.html">385 U. S. 589</a>, 605\xe2\x80\x93606 (1967).  On the other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public.  The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment.  See<em> Connick,</em> <em>supra;</em> <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a> (1968).<em> </em>Outside of this category, the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent some governmental justification \xe2\x80\x9cfar stronger than mere speculation\xe2\x80\x9d in regulating it.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U. S. 454</a>, 465, 475 (1995) <em>(NTEU).</em>  We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>NTEU</em>.  356 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1117.  In <em>NTEU</em> it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer.  The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees.  The Court held that, within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations.  The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities.  The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art,<em> NTEU</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 465, and observed that none of the speech at issue \xe2\x80\x9ceven arguably [had] any adverse impact\xe2\x80\x9d on the employer.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on <em>NTEU</em> was seriously misplaced.  Although Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech.  Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a way injurious to his employer.  The use of the uniform, the law enforcement reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as \xe2\x80\x9cin the field of law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute.  356 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities were \xe2\x80\x9cunrelated\xe2\x80\x9d to his employment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1112, n. 4.  In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper interpretation of the City\xe2\x80\x99s statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roe\xe2\x80\x99s speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD.  It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD.  On that score the City\xe2\x80\x99s consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force.<em> </em>The present case falls outside the protection afforded in <em>NTEU</em>.  The authorities that instead control, and which are considered below, are this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Pickering,</em> <em>supra,</em> <em>Connick,</em> <em>supra,</em> and the decisions which follow them.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To reconcile the employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to engage in speech and the government employer\xe2\x80\x99s right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission, the <em>Pickering</em> Court adopted a balancing test.  It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech to balance \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  391 U. S., at 568; see also<em> Connick,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 142.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Underlying the decision in <em>Pickering</em> is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public.  Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues.  See<em> </em>391 U. S., at 572.  The interest at stake is as much the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own right to disseminate it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pickering</em> did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing.  To require <em>Pickering </em>balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could compromise the proper functioning of government offices.  See<em> Connick,</em> 461 U. S., at 143.<em> </em>This concern prompted the Court in <em>Connick </em>to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in <em>Pickering</em> itself) that in order to merit <em>Pickering </em>balancing, a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech must touch on a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Connick</em>, an assistant district attorney, unhappy with her supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to transfer her to another division, circulated an intraoffice questionnaire.  The document solicited her co-workers\xe2\x80\x99 views on, <em>inter alia</em>, office transfer policy, office morale, the need for grievance committees, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.  See <em>id</em>., at 141.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finding that\xe2\x80\x94with the exception of the final question\xe2\x80\x94the questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances, the Court held no <em>Pickering</em> balancing was required.  461 U. S., at 141.<em> </em>To conclude otherwise would ignore the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 143.  <em>Connick</em> held that<em> </em>a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech is entitled to <em>Pickering</em> balancing only when the employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen upon matters of public concern\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cas an employee upon matters only of personal<em> </em>interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 147.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well-defined, <em>Connick</em> provides some guidance.  It directs courts to examine the \xe2\x80\x9ccontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing whether an employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech addresses a matter of public concern.  <em>Id</em>., at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.  In addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present.  <em>Id</em>., at 143, n. 5.  That standard is established by our decisions in <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp.</em> v. <em>Cohn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/index.html">420 U. S. 469</a> (1975), and <em>Time, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/index.html">385 U. S. 374</a>, 387\xe2\x80\x93388 (1967).  These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication.  The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to <em>Pickering</em> balancing.  See <em>Rankin</em> v. <em>McPherson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/378/index.html">483 U. S. 378</a> (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding that Roe\xe2\x80\x99s expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test.  He fails the threshold test and <em>Pickering</em> balancing does not come into play.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Connick</em> is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in <em>Connick</em> from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern.  The dissent in <em>Connick </em>would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S., at 163 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  No similar purpose could be attributed to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech in the present case.  Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPD\xe2\x80\x99s functioning or operation.  Nor were Roe\xe2\x80\x99s activities anything like the private remarks at issue in <em>Rankin</em>, where one co-worker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news.  Roe\xe2\x80\x99s expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employer\xe2\x80\x99s image.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer.  There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p>\n<right>Reversed.<right></right></right></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
