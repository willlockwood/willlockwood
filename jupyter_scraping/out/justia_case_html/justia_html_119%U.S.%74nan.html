Jennings, 119 U.S.  74 (1886)</h3><p><b>Oregon v. Jennings</b></p><p><b>Submitted October 19, 1886</b></p><p><b>Decided November 15, 1886</b></p><p><b>119 U.S. 74</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Bonds issued by a town in Illinois, signed by its supervisor and town clerk, as a donation to a railroad company, stated that the faith, credit, and property of the town were thereby pledged, "under authority of" an Act of the General Assembly of the state, giving its title and date, and each bond also stated that it and other bonds, giving their numbers and amounts, were "the only hoods issued by said town . . . under and by virtue of said Act."  The Act prescribed the general route of the road, and authorized the town to make a donation to the company to aid in constructing and equipping the road, if the donation should be voted for as prescribed.  It provided for a written application by voters to the town clerk to have an election held, and the giving by him of notice of the election; that the election should "be held and conducted and return thereof made as is provided by law," and that if a majority of the legal voters voting should vote for the donation, the town should, "by its proper corporate authorities," make the donation as should "be determined at said election," and should issue to the company its bonds, "signed by the supervisor and countersigned by the clerk," and should, "by its proper corporate authority," levy an annual tax to pay interest and principal.  The application was made, and the notice given, and the election was held and presided over not by the election judges of the town, but by a moderator and the town clerk, in the manner required for the election of town officers, and resulted in a majority for the donation.  The terms of the vote were that the bonds should not be issued, and the vote should be void, unless the road was completed by a day specified.  The road was not completed by that day.  The supervisor and one of the two justices of the town having resigned, the other justice and the town clerk, on the day before an election for a justice was to be held, appointed a new supervisor, antedating the appointment papers more than three months to the day after the supervisor resigned, and the new supervisor and the town clerk, on the same day, signed the bonds and delivered them to the company.  The next day, a new justice and a new supervisor were elected by the people.  In a suit against the town to recover on coupons cut from the bonds, by a <em>bona fide</em> holder of the bonds and coupons for a valuable consideration, without notice, it was set up in defense that the officers of the company conspired with the justice and the town clerk and their appointee to have the bonds issued before a new supervisor should be elected by the people.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 119 U.

The meeting was called to order by the town clerk, and, on motion of W. J. Mix, E. J. Reiman was chosen moderator of said meeting, and was duly sworn by the town clerk.  Proclamation was then made of the opening of the polls, which were kept open until 12 o\'clock M., when, on motion of O. Wilson, they were closed for one hour, until one o\'clock, for dinner, by proclamation of the town clerk.  At one o\'clock, the polls were again proclaimed open, and were kept open until six o\'clock P.M., proclamation being made half hour before the closing of the polls.  At the hour of six P.M., the moderator proceeded to count out the ballots, until they were all counted, which number equaled the numbers on the poll list.  The ballots were then read by the moderator, and resulted as follows, there being for donation, as stated in the notice, one hundred and sixty-three votes, against donation, as stated in the notice, twelve votes.  The result being publicly read, the meeting was then closed."</p>\n<p>"E. J. REIMAN, <em>Moderator</em>"</p>\n<p>"Attest:  F. H. MARSH, <em>Town Clerk</em>"</p>\n<p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 119 U. S. 83</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A defense set up to the validity of the bonds in the amended second plea is that their execution was obtained by fraud and circumvention.  This is founded on the following facts:</p>\n<p>The first division of the road was not completed or equipped in accordance with the application, and the notice of election, and the vote, on or before the 1st of January, 1871, but was completed by the 1st of April, 1871.  On the 30th of December, 1870, Mortimer W. Smith, supervisor of the town, gave to the town clerk of the town his written resignation of the office of supervisor, and it was placed among the records of the town clerk\'s office.  He never afterwards acted as supervisor.  The town had by law one supervisor and two justices of the peace and one town clerk.  They were all of them, by statute, town officers.  William Schultz was elected one of the justices of the town April 5, 1870, and duly qualified as such April 9, 1870.  He continued to reside in the town until after April 3, 1871, and during the year 1871, but was absent from the town, and in the City of New York, from December 26, 1870, till about January 6, 1871.  He resigned his office on March 2, 1871, by filing his resignation in the office of the clerk of the county, who entered it of record according to law.  After that, he did not act as a justice.  A successor to Schultz as a justice was elected by the people at the annual town meeting held April 4, 1871, and not before, and such successor qualified April 8, 1871, and was commissioned April 15, 1871.  James H. Cartwright was the other justice of the peace.  Frederick H. Marsh was the town clerk.</p>\n<p>The following statutory provisions were in force in Illinois in 1870 and 1871:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 16.  Resignations of the office of justice of the peace and constable shall be made to the clerk of the court of the proper county, who shall immediately enter the date of every such resignation in the book above provided for [that is, a book to be kept by the clerk of the county in which he was required to enter the name of every justice of the peace and constable sworn into office, together with the date of his commission or certificate, and the time of his being sworn into office], which book, or a certified copy of an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 119 U. S. 84</a></p><p> entry in the same, shall be received in evidence in all courts within this state."</p>\n<p>Gross\' Stat., 1869, 3d ed., c. 59, p. 394.</p>\n<p>"1. Whenever any town shall fail to elect the proper number of town officers to which such town may be entitled by law, or when any person elected to any town office shall fail to qualify as such, or whenever any vacancy shall happen in any town office from death, resignation, removal from the town, or other cause, it shall be lawful for the justices of the peace of the town, together with the supervisor and town clerk, to fill the vacancy or vacancies occasioned or occurring in consequence of either or any of the causes above specified, by appointment by warrant under their hands and seals, and the persons so appointed shall hold their respective offices during the unexpired term of the persons in whose stead they have been appointed, and until others are chosen or appointed in their places, and shall have the same powers, and be subject to the same duties and penalties, as if they had been duly chosen by the electors."</p>\n<p>"2. Whenever a vacancy shall occur, from any cause, in any or either of the offices enumerated in the foregoing section, as composing the board of appointment for the appointment of town officers, in case of vacancy, it shall be lawful for the remaining officers of such appointing board to fill any vacancy or vacancies thus occurring, except in cases of vacancy in the office of justice of the peace, which shall be filled only by election."</p>\n<p>"3. When any appointment shall be made as provided in the two preceding sections, the officers making the same shall cause the warrant of appointment to be forthwith filed in the office of the town clerk, who shall forthwith give notice to each person appointed."</p>\n<p>Gross\' Stat., 1869, vol. 1, 3d ed., c. 103d, art. 7, pp. 750, 751.</p>\n<p>On the 3d of April, 1871, Cartwright (the remaining justice) and Marsh (the town clerk) met at the office of the town clerk and, by a paper then signed by each of them, appointed Elias S. Potter to fill the vacancy in the office of supervisor caused by the resignation of Smith, and ordered the clerk to give the certificate of appointment to Potter.  The paper bore date the 31st of December, 1870, and was filed in the office of the town clerk on the 3d of April, 1871.  On the same 3d of April, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 119 U. S. 85</a></p><p> a proper official bond, executed on that day by Potter and two sureties but bearing date the 31st of December, 1870, was filed in the office of the town clerk, with an oath of office signed and sworn to by Potter before Cartwright on the same 3d of April, but purporting to have been subscribed and sworn to on the 31st of December, 1870.  On the same 3d of April, Potter, as supervisor, and Marsh, as town clerk, signed the bonds and the coupons, and delivered them to the President of the railroad company.  One Dwight was elected supervisor of the town at the regular annual town meeting held on April 4, 1871, and assumed the office, April 10, 1871, and held it for the ensuing year.  It was known to all parties that this town meeting was to be held, and it is alleged that the officers of the railroad company conspired with Cartwright and Marsh to procure the appointment of Potter as supervisor so that the bonds might be issued before the election by the people of a new supervisor on April 4, 1871.</p>\n<p>The statute of Illinois as to fraud and circumvention set up and relied on, is as follows:</p>\n<p>"11.  If any fraud or circumvention be used in obtaining the making or executing of any of the instruments aforesaid [that is, any note, bond, bill, or other instrument in writing, for the payment of money or property, or the performance of covenants or conditions], such fraud or circumvention may be pleaded in bar to any action to be brought on any such instrument so obtained, whether such action be brought by the party committing such fraud or circumvention, or any assignee or assignees of such instrument."</p>\n<p>Gross\' Stat. 1869, vol. 1, 3d ed., c. 73, p. 462. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 119 U.

The Act prescribed the general route of the road, and authorized the town to make a donation to the company to aid in constructing and equipping the road, if the donation should be voted for as prescribed.  It provided for a written application by voters to the town clerk to have an election held, and the giving by him of notice of the election; that the election should "be held and conducted and return thereof made as is provided by law," and that if a majority of the legal voters voting should vote for the donation, the town should, "by its proper corporate authorities," make the donation as should "be determined at said election," and should issue to the company its bonds, "signed by the supervisor and countersigned by the clerk," and should, "by its proper corporate authority," levy an annual tax to pay interest and principal.  The application was made, and the notice given, and the election was held and presided over not by the election judges of the town, but by a moderator and the town clerk, in the manner required for the election of town officers, and resulted in a majority for the donation.  The terms of the vote were that the bonds should not be issued, and the vote should be void, unless the road was completed by a day specified.  The road was not completed by that day.  The supervisor and one of the two justices of the town having resigned, the other justice and the town clerk, on the day before an election for a justice was to be held, appointed a new supervisor, antedating the appointment papers more than three months to the day after the supervisor resigned, and the new supervisor and the town clerk, on the same day, signed the bonds and delivered them to the company.  The next day, a new justice and a new supervisor were elected by the people.  In a suit against the town to recover on coupons cut from the bonds, by a <em>bona fide</em> holder of the bonds and coupons for a valuable consideration, without notice, it was set up in defense that the officers of the company conspired with the justice and the town clerk and their appointee to have the bonds issued before a new supervisor should be elected by the people.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 119 U.

S. 83</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A defense set up to the validity of the bonds in the amended second plea is that their execution was obtained by fraud and circumvention.  This is founded on the following facts:</p>\n<p>The first division of the road was not completed or equipped in accordance with the application, and the notice of election, and the vote, on or before the 1st of January, 1871, but was completed by the 1st of April, 1871.  On the 30th of December, 1870, Mortimer W. Smith, supervisor of the town, gave to the town clerk of the town his written resignation of the office of supervisor, and it was placed among the records of the town clerk\'s office.  He never afterwards acted as supervisor.  The town had by law one supervisor and two justices of the peace and one town clerk.  They were all of them, by statute, town officers.  William Schultz was elected one of the justices of the town April 5, 1870, and duly qualified as such April 9, 1870.  He continued to reside in the town until after April 3, 1871, and during the year 1871, but was absent from the town, and in the City of New York, from December 26, 1870, till about January 6, 1871.  He resigned his office on March 2, 1871, by filing his resignation in the office of the clerk of the county, who entered it of record according to law.  After that, he did not act as a justice.  A successor to Schultz as a justice was elected by the people at the annual town meeting held April 4, 1871, and not before, and such successor qualified April 8, 1871, and was commissioned April 15, 1871.  James H. Cartwright was the other justice of the peace.  Frederick H. Marsh was the town clerk.</p>\n<p>The following statutory provisions were in force in Illinois in 1870 and 1871:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 16.  Resignations of the office of justice of the peace and constable shall be made to the clerk of the court of the proper county, who shall immediately enter the date of every such resignation in the book above provided for [that is, a book to be kept by the clerk of the county in which he was required to enter the name of every justice of the peace and constable sworn into office, together with the date of his commission or certificate, and the time of his being sworn into office], which book, or a certified copy of an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 119 U.

Whenever any town shall fail to elect the proper number of town officers to which such town may be entitled by law, or when any person elected to any town office shall fail to qualify as such, or whenever any vacancy shall happen in any town office from death, resignation, removal from the town, or other cause, it shall be lawful for the justices of the peace of the town, together with the supervisor and town clerk, to fill the vacancy or vacancies occasioned or occurring in consequence of either or any of the causes above specified, by appointment by warrant under their hands and seals, and the persons so appointed shall hold their respective offices during the unexpired term of the persons in whose stead they have been appointed, and until others are chosen or appointed in their places, and shall have the same powers, and be subject to the same duties and penalties, as if they had been duly chosen by the electors."</p>\n<p>"2. Whenever a vacancy shall occur, from any cause, in any or either of the offices enumerated in the foregoing section, as composing the board of appointment for the appointment of town officers, in case of vacancy, it shall be lawful for the remaining officers of such appointing board to fill any vacancy or vacancies thus occurring, except in cases of vacancy in the office of justice of the peace, which shall be filled only by election."</p>\n<p>"3. When any appointment shall be made as provided in the two preceding sections, the officers making the same shall cause the warrant of appointment to be forthwith filed in the office of the town clerk, who shall forthwith give notice to each person appointed."</p>\n<p>Gross\' Stat., 1869, vol. 1, 3d ed., c. 103d, art. 7, pp. 750, 751.</p>\n<p>On the 3d of April, 1871, Cartwright (the remaining justice) and Marsh (the town clerk) met at the office of the town clerk and, by a paper then signed by each of them, appointed Elias S. Potter to fill the vacancy in the office of supervisor caused by the resignation of Smith, and ordered the clerk to give the certificate of appointment to Potter.  The paper bore date the 31st of December, 1870, and was filed in the office of the town clerk on the 3d of April, 1871.  On the same 3d of April, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 119 U. S. 85</a></p><p> a proper official bond, executed on that day by Potter and two sureties but bearing date the 31st of December, 1870, was filed in the office of the town clerk, with an oath of office signed and sworn to by Potter before Cartwright on the same 3d of April, but purporting to have been subscribed and sworn to on the 31st of December, 1870.  On the same 3d of April, Potter, as supervisor, and Marsh, as town clerk, signed the bonds and the coupons, and delivered them to the President of the railroad company.  One Dwight was elected supervisor of the town at the regular annual town meeting held on April 4, 1871, and assumed the office, April 10, 1871, and held it for the ensuing year.  It was known to all parties that this town meeting was to be held, and it is alleged that the officers of the railroad company conspired with Cartwright and Marsh to procure the appointment of Potter as supervisor so that the bonds might be issued before the election by the people of a new supervisor on April 4, 1871.</p>\n<p>The statute of Illinois as to fraud and circumvention set up and relied on, is as follows:</p>\n<p>"11.  If any fraud or circumvention be used in obtaining the making or executing of any of the instruments aforesaid [that is, any note, bond, bill, or other instrument in writing, for the payment of money or property, or the performance of covenants or conditions], such fraud or circumvention may be pleaded in bar to any action to be brought on any such instrument so obtained, whether such action be brought by the party committing such fraud or circumvention, or any assignee or assignees of such instrument."</p>\n<p>Gross\' Stat. 1869, vol. 1, 3d ed., c. 73, p. 462. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 119 U. S. 89</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The court refused to submit to the jury, and we think properly, any question as to whether the making or execution of the bonds and coupons was obtained by fraud or circumvention.</p>\n<p>Even if the statute applies to town bonds and their coupons, no fraud or imposition was practiced on Potter or Marsh to induce them to sign these bonds and coupons.  They knew what they were signing, and signed intentionally.  The fraud or circumvention intended by the statute, which only embodies a rule of the common law, is not that which goes merely to the consideration of the instrument, but it must go to the execution or making, and there must be a trick or device by which one kind of instrument is signed in the belief that it is of another kind, or the amount or nature or terms of the instrument must be misrepresented to the signer.  No different ruling as to the statute has ever been made by the Supreme Court of Illinois, especially in a case where, as here, the holder of the instrument is a <em>bona fide</em> holder of it, before maturity, for a valuable consideration, without notice.  In <em>Latham v. Smith,</em> 45 Ill. 25, decided in 1867, in construing this statute, the court said:</p>\n<p>"A fraud in obtaining a note may consist of any artifice practiced upon a person to induce him to execute it, when he did not intend to do such an act.  \'Circumvention\' seems to be nearly, if not quite, synonymous with \'fraud.\'  It is any fraud whereby a person is induced by deceit to make a deed or other instrument.  It must be borne in mind that the fraud or covin must relate to the obtaining of the instrument itself, and not to the consideration upon which it is based.  It is not fraud which relates to the quality, quantity, value, or character of the consideration that moves the contract, but it is such a trick or device as induces the giving of one character of instrument under the belief that it is another of a different character, such as giving a note or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 119 U. S. 90</a></p><p> other agreement for one sum or thing when it is for another sum or thing, or as giving a note under the belief that it is a receipt."</p>\n<p>This ruling was followed in <em>Shipley v. Carroll,</em> 45 Ill. 285; <em>Elliott v. Levings,</em> 54 Ill. 213, and <em>Maxcy v. Williamson County,</em> 72 Ill. 207.</p>\n<p>It is also contended that the appointment of Potter as supervisor was invalid because Schultz, though he had resigned as justice, legally continued in office till his successor was elected, and yet took no part in the appointment.  But it is plain, we think, that within the language and meaning of the statute as respects the four members of the appointing board designated by statute, two of them were out of office so far as their acting as such members was concerned.  The supervisor and Schultz had resigned, and their offices were vacant, and it was lawful for the remaining two officers to fill the vacancy in the office of supervisor.  No authority to which we are referred holds to the contrary.  Where a town is trying to escape the enforcement of its liability to creditors through the resignation of an officer on whom process is to be served and the failure to supply his place, the resigning officer is rightly held, <em>quoad</em> creditors, to continue in office, subject to the service of process, till his successor qualifies.  In the present case, there was not only a "vacancy" in the office of supervisor for the purpose of filling it under \xc2\xa7 1, but there was a vacancy in the office which Schultz had held, for the purpose of the action of Cartwright and Marsh alone, as the remaining officers of the appointing board, to appoint a supervisor, under \xc2\xa7 2.  On any other construction, as by \xc2\xa7 2 a vacancy in the office of justice can be filled only by election, a town would, in case of a vacancy in the office of justice, have to go without a supervisor, in case of a vacancy in his office, till a justice could be elected.</p>\n<p>Another defense is set up under the amended third plea founded on \xc2\xa7 12 of Article 9 of the Constitution of Illinois, which went into effect August 8, 1870, and provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 12.  No county, city, township, school district, or other municipal corporation shall be allowed to become indebted in any manner or for any purpose to an amount, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 119 U. S. 91</a></p><p> including existing indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding five percent on the value of the taxable property therein, to be ascertained by the last assessment for the state and county taxes previous to the incurring of such indebtedness.  Any county, city, school district, or other municipal corporation incurring any indebtedness as aforesaid shall, before or at the time of doing so, provide for the collection of a direct annual tax sufficient to pay the interest on such debt as it falls due, and also to pay and discharge the principal thereof within twenty years from the time of contracting the same.  This section shall not be construed to prevent any county, city, township, school district, or other municipal corporation from issuing their bonds in compliance with any vote of the people which may have been had prior to the adoption of this constitution, in pursuance of any law providing therefor."</p>\n<p>It appearing that when the bonds in question in this suit were issued, the debt of the town was already greater than five percent on the value of its taxable property as ascertained by the assessment for 1870, it is contended that the bonds could not be lawfully issued except in compliance with the vote of June 23, 1870, and in conformity with the conditions imposed by that vote, one of which was the completion and equipment of the first division of the road on or before January 1, 1871, and that that condition was not observed.  The question is sought to be made one of power or authority to issue the bonds within the rules laid down by this Court as applicable even in the case of bonds in the hands of a <em>bona fide</em> holder.</p>\n<p>At the time the bonds in question were issued, a statute enacted April 16, 1869, was in force in Illinois, \xc2\xa7 7 of which, Gross\' Stat. 1869, vol. 1, 3d ed, p. 556, provided that any town should have the right,</p>\n<p>"upon making any subscription or donation to any railroad company, to prescribe the conditions upon which such bonds, subscriptions, or donations shall be made, and such bonds, subscriptions, or donations shall not be valid and binding until such conditions precedent shall have been complied with."</p>\n<p>The language of this statute was as imperative as is that of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 119 U. S. 92</a></p><p> the Constitution of 1870 in regard to complying with the conditions contained in any vote of the people, and \xc2\xa7 6 of the Act of March 30, 1869, before cited, prescribes that the proper corporate authorities of the town shall make the donation or subscription "as shall be determined at said election."</p>\n<p>In respect to this compliance with the conditions imposed by the vote of the people, whether the question is to be regarded as arising under the provision of the constitution or that of a statute, it must equally be regarded as concluded by the recital in the bonds made by the supervisor and the town clerk.  Section 6 of the Act of March 30, 1869, provides that if a majority of the legal voters of the town, voting at the election, vote for the donation, the town shall, by its "corporate authorities," make the donation to the company, "as shall be determined at said election," and shall issue its bonds to the company, "which bonds shall be signed by the supervisor, and countersigned by the clerk in towns organized under the township law."  Within the numerous decisions by this Court on the subject, the supervisor and the town clerk, they being named in the statute as the officers to sign the bonds, and the "corporate authorities" to act for the town in issuing them to the company, were the persons entrusted with the duty of deciding, before issuing the bonds, whether the conditions determined at the election existed.  If they have certified to that effect in the bonds, the town is estopped from asserting, as against a <em>bona fide</em> holder, that the conditions prescribed by the popular vote were not complied with.  They state in each bond that the faith, credit, and property of the town are, by the bond, solemnly pledged for the payment of the principal and interest named in it "under authority of" the Act of March 30, 1869, reciting its title, and that the sixty bonds, amounting to $50,000, "are the only bonds issued by said Town of Oregon under and by virtue of said act."  The provision in \xc2\xa7 6 of the act that the town shall, by its proper corporate authority, annually assess and levy a tax to pay the interest and principal of the bonds is a warrant for the pledge made in the bonds of the faith, credit, and property of the town.  The recitals are within the adjudged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 119 U. S. 93</a></p><p> cases in this Court as to the effect of recitals in bonds that they are issued "under authority of" a specified statute, and "under and by virtue of" that statute, and they estop the town from taking the defense that the first division of the road was not completed by the time specified, as against the plaintiff as a <em>bona fide</em> holder of the bonds.</p>\n<p>In <em>Pana v. Bowler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/107/529/case.html">107 U. S. 529</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/107/529/case.html#539">107 U. S. 539</a></span>, this Court upheld the effectiveness of a recital in bonds, in favor of a <em>bona fide</em> holder, as against an alleged defect in the mode of conducting an election held prior to the adoption of this same Constitution of Illinois, the bonds being issued after its adoption, although that instrument forbade the issuing of the bonds unless their issue should have been authorized under then existing laws, by a vote of the people prior to the adoption of the constitution.</p>\n<p>The present case is directly within the decision of this Court in <em>Ins. Co. v. Bruce,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/328/case.html">105 U. S. 328</a></span>, where it was held that recitals in bonds estopped a town in Illinois, as against a <em>bona fide</em> holder, from showing that conditions imposed on its liability by the vote of the people had not been complied with, although the statute declared that the bonds should not be valid and binding until such conditions precedent had been complied with.  There are numerous other cases in this Court to the same effect.</p>\n<p>The provision of \xc2\xa7 12 of Article 9 of the Constitution of Illinois did not introduce any new rule of evidence in regard to the mode of proving, in favor of a <em>bona fide</em> holder, the compliance with the vote of the people, but left the compliance to be conclusively established in such a case by the recital in the bonds made by the designated official authorities.</p>\n<p>We are not referred to any decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois made prior to the issuing of the bonds in question which holds to the contrary of the views we have announced.  The case of <em>People v. Dutcher,</em> 56 Ill. 144, decided at September term, 1870, was a mandamus applied for by a railroad company to compel a supervisor to subscribe for stock, where conditions imposed by the vote of the town had not been complied with, and its bonds had not been issued.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 119 U. S. 94</a></p><p> mandamus was refused.  This direct proceeding is, as this Court has uniformly held, a very different thing from a suit on the bonds by a <em>bona fide</em> holder, the cases not being analogous or governed by the same rules.</p>\n<p>A defense is also set up, under the amended fourth plea, founded on the second additional section or article to the Constitution of Illinois of 1870, which took effect July 2, 1870, and is in these words:</p>\n<p>"No county, city, town, township, or other municipality shall ever become subscriber to the capital stock of any railroad or private corporation, or make donation to or loan its credit in aid of such corporation, <em>provided, however,</em> that the adoption of this article shall not be construed as affecting the right or any such municipality to make such subscriptions where the same have been authorized, under existing laws, by a vote of the people of such municipalities prior to such adoption."</p>\n<p>The bonds in question having been issued after July 2, 1870, and the requirement, to make them valid, being that they must have been authorized under laws in force before July 2, 1870, by a vote of the people of the town given before that date, it is contended that they were not so authorized, because the vote of June 23, 1870, was taken at a town meeting held and presided over by a moderator, and not by judges of election.  The argument made is that section 6 of the Act of March 30, 1869, provided that the election should</p>\n<p>"be held and conducted, and return thereof made, as is provided by law, and, in any village or city, as is provided by the law under which the same is incorporated,"</p>\n<p>and that a town meeting, presided over by a moderator, and not held by the supervisor, assessor, and collector, as judges of election, was not an "election" within the meaning of the statute, and so was not an election "under existing laws," within the meaning of the constitution.</p>\n<p>The election was in fact conducted in the manner required for the election of town officers, and not in the manner required for general elections.  We are of opinion that under the act of 1869, the election in a town could properly be conducted in the manner prescribed by law for the election in towns of town officers -- namely by a moderator and the town </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 119 U. S. 95</a></p><p> clerk, the town clerk having given, as required by the act, the prior notice of the election, and the return of the election being filed in the office of the town clerk, and the two officers being paid by the town.  The voting for town officers at annual town meetings, in the manner prescribed therefor by the statutes of Illinois, is called in those statutes an "election," and this special voting in the same manner for this town object was an "election" within the meaning of the act of 1869.  The requirement of the act is that the "election shall be held and conducted, and return thereof made, as is provided by law," and not "as is provided by law for general elections."  If a town, it is the law provided for town elections.  If a village or city, and the law of its incorporation has special provisions, those are to followed; otherwise, any general law as to village or city elections is to be observed.  As the proceeding was to originate by an application filed in the town clerk\'s office, so the same officers who would conduct an ordinary town election were to be concerned with this election, and the town clerk\'s office was to be the place of deposit of all the papers and of the return of the vote, and two town officers were to issue the bonds.  None of the proceedings were to be connected with the county clerk\'s office, as in the case of a general election.  This was the ruling of the Supreme Court of Illinois in a case decided after June 23, 1870, though before these bonds were issued, <em>People v. Dutcher,</em> 56 Ill. 144, and it was followed in other cases in that court after the bonds were issued, though somewhat modified more recently.  We think it was the correct ruling.</p>\n<p>The questions above considered cover substantially all the assignments of error.  The direction to find a verdict for the plaintiff was proper.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
