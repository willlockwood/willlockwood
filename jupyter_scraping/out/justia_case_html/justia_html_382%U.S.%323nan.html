JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The disputed issue here is whether a bankruptcy court has summary jurisdiction to order the surrender of voidable preferences asserted and proved by the trustee in response to a claim filed by the creditor who received the preferences.  The Court of Appeals held that the bankruptcy court had such summary jurisdiction.  336 F.2d 535.  We affirm.</p>\n<p>The corporate bankrupt began business on April 21, 1960, and borrowed $50,000 from two local banks.  Petitioner, then an officer of the company, was an accommodation maker on the two corporate notes delivered to the banks.  After the corporate bankrupt in this case suffered a disastrous fire, its funds and collections were placed in a "trust account" under the sole control of petitioner.  From this account petitioner made two payments on one of the company notes on which he was an accommodation maker and one payment on the other.  Bankruptcy followed within four months of these payments.  Petitioner filed two claims in the proceeding, one for rent due him from the bankrupt and one for a payment on one of the notes made from his personal funds.  The trustee responded with a petition asserting that the payments from the trust fund to the banks were voidable preferences and demanding judgment for the amount of the preferences, along with the amount of an unpaid stock subscription owed to the corporation by petitioner.  Petitioner\'s objection to the summary jurisdiction of the referee was overruled, and judgment was rendered for the trustee on both the preferences and the stock subscription.  Petitioner\'s claims were to be allowed only when and if the judgment was satisfied.  The District Court sustained the referee.  A divided Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, after reconsidering <em>Inter-State National Bank of Kansas City v. Luther,</em> 221 F.2d </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 382 U. S. 326</a></p><p> 382 (C.A.10th Cir. 1955), <em>cert. dismissed under Rule 60,</em> 350 U.S. 944, adhered to its pronouncements in that case, affirmed the judgment for the amount of the voidable preferences but reversed the judgment for the amount of the stock subscription.  The trustee did not seek review here of the adverse decision on the stock subscription.  We granted certiorari on the creditor\'s petition because of the diversity of views among the Courts of Appeals on the issue involved [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and the importance of the question in the administration of the bankruptcy laws.  380 U.S. 971.</p>\n<p>The crux of the dispute here concerns the mode of procedure for trying out the preference issue.  The bankruptcy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 382 U. S. 327</a></p><p> courts are expressly invested by statute with original jurisdiction to conduct proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  These courts are essentially courts of equity, <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/234/case.html">292 U.

Petitioner contends the situation is the same when the creditor files a claim and the trustee not only objects to allowance of the claim, but also demands surrender of the preference.  This is so, petitioner argues, because the Bankruptcy Act does not confer summary jurisdiction on a bankruptcy court to order preferences surrendered, and because, if it does, petitioner\'s rights under the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution are violated.  We agree with neither contention.</p>\n<p>With respect to the statutory question, it must be conceded that the Bankruptcy Act does not, in express terms, confer summary jurisdiction to order claimants to surrender preferences.  But Congress has often left the exact scope of summary proceedings in bankruptcy undefined, and this Court has elsewhere recognized that, in the absence of congressional definition, this is a matter to be determined by decisions of this Court after due consideration of the structure and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act as a whole, as well as the particular provisions of the Act brought in question.  <em>Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v.

Moreover, this Court has long recognized that a chief purpose of the bankruptcy laws is "to secure a prompt and effectual administration and settlement of the estate of all bankrupts within a limited period," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/292/case.html">Ex</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 382 U.

Further, the Act itself directs that</p>\n<p>"[o]bjections to claims shall be heard and determined as soon as the convenience of the court and the best interests of the estates and the claimants will permit,"</p>\n<p>Bankruptcy Act, \xc2\xa7 57(f), 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 93(f) (1964 ed.), and a committee report indicates that the provision means that "[o]bjections shall be heard and determined in a summary way," H.R.Rep. No. 1674, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 20.</p>\n<p>Section 57 of the Act contains another important congressional directive around which much of this case turns.  Subsection g forbids the allowance of a claim when the creditor has "received of acquired preferences . . . void or voidable under this title" absent a surrender of any preference.  Bankruptcy Act, \xc2\xa7 57(g), 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 93(g) (1964 ed.). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Unavoidably, and by the very terms of the Act, when a bankruptcy trustee presents a \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection to a claim, the claim can neither be allowed nor disallowed until the preference matter is adjudicated.  The objection under \xc2\xa7 57(g) is, like other objections, part and parcel of the allowance process, and is subject to summary adjudication by a bankruptcy court.  This is the plain import of \xc2\xa7 57, and finds support in the same </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 382 U.

The provisions of the Acts of 1800 and 1841 which gave the creditor the right to have his claim tried by a jury were not repeated in the Acts of 1867 and 1898. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Section 19 of the current law, Bankruptcy Act, \xc2\xa7 19, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 42 (1964 ed.), requires a jury in only limited situations, and is not helpful to petitioner in this case.  It is true that \xc2\xa7 60, dealing with preferences and their voidability, confers concurrent jurisdiction on state courts and the federal bankruptcy courts to entertain plenary suits for the recovery of preferences.  But, by its own terms, this provision applies only "where plenary proceedings are necessary," and hence itself contemplates non-plenary recovery proceedings. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>If anything, the other provisions of the Act support the view that \xc2\xa7 57(g), objections are to be summarily determined.  Section 57(k) provides for reconsideration of claims that have previously been allowed, and \xc2\xa7 57(l) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 382 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Even under the predecessor to the present section, which did not expressly provide that the dividend could be summarily recovered, Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \xc2\xa7 57(1), 30 Stat. 561, this Court held that the referee had jurisdiction to determine whether a preference has been received and to order return of the dividend.  <em>Pirie v.

But once it is established that the issue of preference may be summarily adjudicated absent an affirmative demand for surrender of the preference, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 382 U. S. 334</a></p><p> it can hardly be doubted that there is also summary jurisdiction to order the return of the preference.  This is so because, in passing on a \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection, a bankruptcy court must necessarily determine the amount of preference, if any, so as to ascertain whether the claimant, should he return the preference, has satisfied the condition imposed by \xc2\xa7 57(g) on allowance of the claim.  <em>Schwartz v. Levine &amp; Malin, Ins.,</em> 111 F.2d 81 (C.A.2d Cir. 1940).  Thus, once a bankruptcy court has dealt with the preference issue, nothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit.  The normal rules of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel apply to the decisions of bankruptcy courts.  <em>Chicot County Drainage District v.

The Courts of Appeals have uniformly applied these principles to hold that a bankruptcy court\'s resolution of the \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection is <em>res judicata</em> in a subsequent action by the trustee under \xc2\xa7 60 to recover the preference.  <em>Schwartz v.

Unquestionably, the bankruptcy court would have power to give such an instruction to the trustee, <em>Thompson v.

Nevertheless, we think this argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p>At the outset, we note that the <em>Dairy Queen</em> doctrine, if applicable at all, is applicable whether or not the trustee seeks affirmative relief.  For, as we have said, determination of the preference issues in the equitable proceeding would in any case render unnecessary a trial in the plenary action, because of the <em>res judicata</em> effect to which that determination would be entitled.  Thus, petitioner\'s argument would require that, in every case where a \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection is interposed and a jury trial is demanded, the proceedings on allowance of claims must be suspended and a plenary suit initiated, with all the delay and expense that course would entail.  Such a result is not consistent with the equitable purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, nor with the rule of <em>Beacon Theatres</em> and <em>Dairy Queen,</em> which is itself an equitable doctrine, <em>Beacon Theatres v. Westover,</em> 359 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/500/case.html#509">359 U. S. 509</a></span>-510.  In neither <em>Beacon Theatres</em> nor <em>Dairy Queen</em> was there involved a specific statutory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a disputed claim without the intervention of a jury.  We think Congress intended the trustee\'s \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection to be summarily determined; and to say that, because the trustee could bring an independent suit against the creditor to recover his voidable preference, he is not entitled to have his statutory objection to the claim tried in the bankruptcy court in the normal manner is to dismember a scheme which Congress has prescribed.  <em>See Alexander v. Hillman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/296/222/case.html">296 U.

Both <em>Beacon Theatres</em> and <em>Dairy Queen</em> recognize that there might be situations in which the Court could proceed to resolve the equitable claim first even though the results might be dispositive of the issues involved in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 382 U. S. 340</a></p><p> the legal claim.  To implement congressional intent, we think it essential to hold that the bankruptcy court may summarily adjudicate the \xc2\xa7 57(g) objection; and, as we have held above, the power to adjudicate the objection carries with it the power to order surrender of the preference.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

In <em>Avery,</em> the preference arose out of a different transaction than the creditor\'s claim, and a subsequent decision of the Fifth Circuit notes that, although that fact was not the articulated basis of the <em>Avery</em> decision, it may not preclude summary jurisdiction to order return of a preference received in the same transaction.  <em>Gill v.

The Fifth Circuit rule is thus uncertain, but <em>Avery</em> at least prevents summary recovery of unrelated preferences.

The decision presently under review upholds summary jurisdiction to order return of a preference whether or not the preference relates to the same transaction as the claim but declines to extend such jurisdiction to unrelated counterclaims not involving a preference, set-off, voidable lien, or a fraudulent transfer.  336 F.2d at 537.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Bankruptcy Act, \xc2\xa7 2, sub. a, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 11, sub. a (1964 ed.), provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) The courts of the United States hereinbefore defined as courts of bankruptcy are hereby created courts of bankruptcy and are invested, within their respective territorial limits as now established or as they may be hereafter changed, with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in proceedings under this title. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 11, sub. a(2) confers power to:</p>\n<p>"(2) Allow claims, disallow claims, reconsider allowed or disallowed claims, and allow or disallow them against bankrupt estates."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 75, sub. a(8) provides that trustees shall:</p>\n<p>"(8) examine all proofs of claim and object to the allowance of such claims as may be improper."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 93, sub. g provides:</p>\n<p>"(g) The claims of creditors who have received or acquired preferences, liens, conveyances, transfers, assignments or encumbrances, void or voidable under this title, shall not be allowed unless such creditors shall surrender such preferences, liens, conveyances, transfers, assignments, or encumbrances."</p>\n<p>The language of this section, it will be observed, is concerned with <em>creditors,</em> rather than <em>claims,</em> and thus contemplates that allowance of a claim may be conditioned on surrender of preferences received with respect to transactions unrelated to the claims.  The exact reach of \xc2\xa7 57, sub. g is not entirely settled, <em>see</em> 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, 57.19(3.2) (14th ed. 1964), and that question is not involved here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The history of the early jury trial provisions is traced in <em>In re United Button Co.,</em> 140 F. 495 (D.C.D.Del.), <em>aff\'d sub nom.

Where the preference is voidable, the trustee may recover the property or, if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted such property, except a bona-fide purchaser from or lienor of the debtor\'s transferee for a present fair equivalent value. . . .  For the purpose of any recovery or avoidance under this section, where plenary proceedings are necessary, and State court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened and any court of bankruptcy shall have concurrent jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Bankruptcy Act, \xc2\xa7 57(k) and (l) and 1, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 93(k) and (l) (1964 ed.), provide:</p>\n<p>"(k) Claims which have been allowed may be reconsidered for cause and reallowed or rejected in whole or in part according to the equities of the case, before but not after the estate has been closed."</p>\n<p>"(l) Whenever a claim shall have been reconsidered and rejected, in whole or in part, upon which a dividend has been paid, the trustee may recover from the creditor the amount of the dividend received upon the claim if rejected in whole, or the proportional part thereof if rejected only in part, and the trustee may also recover any excess dividend paid to any creditor.  The court shall have summary jurisdiction of a proceeding by the trustee to recover any such dividends."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Under the Act as it then stood, the preference involved in <em>Pirie</em> was not voidable or recoverable, but nevertheless was ample ground for disallowance of the claim.  But the creditor argued that compelling repayment of the dividend would constitute determination of a "suit by the trustee" without the consent of the defendant contrary to the provisions of then \xc2\xa7 23(b) (presently codified, without alterations material to the present discussion, in 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 46(b) (1964 ed.)) that:</p>\n<p>"b Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant."</p>\n<p>30 Stat. 552.  That argument was rejected by the Court on the ground the proceedings under review were not a "suit" within the meaning of the quoted provision.  182 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/182/438/case.html#455">182 U. S. 455</a></span>-456.  We apply that reasoning in our opinion today, and hold that determination of objections to claims, whether or not affirmative relief is decreed, does not constitute adjudication of a suit by the trustee, and thus it is not necessary to ascertain whether the creditor has "consented" to such determination within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 23(b).  Rather, our decision is governed by the</p>\n<p>"traditional bankruptcy law that he who invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the consequences of that procedure.  <em>Wiswall v.

As this is the basis of our decision, we obviously intimate no opinion concerning whether the referee has summary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which have not been disposed of in passing on objections to the claim.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 96(d) provides:</p>\n<p>"(d) If a debtor shall, directly or indirectly, in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or against him, pay money or transfer property to an attorney at law, for services rendered or to be rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the trustee or any creditor and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the trustee for the benefit of the estate. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">note 5</a> <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> the decisions cited in  <a href="#F1" name="T1">note 1</a> <em>supra,</em> upholding summary jurisdiction to grant affirmative relief on related counterclaims that would also be defenses to the claim, particularly <em>In re Solar Mfg.
