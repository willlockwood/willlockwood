RLUIPA targets two areas of state and local action: land\xe2\x80\x93use regulation, RLUIPA \xc2\xa72, 42 U.

Granting respondents summary judgment, the District Court held that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon\xe2\x80\x99s claims for monetary relief.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief against a government\xe2\x80\x9d did not unambiguously notify Texas that its acceptance of federal funds was conditioned on a waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for monetary relief.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA.

And the context here\xe2\x80\x94where the defendant is a sovereign\xe2\x80\x94suggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/743/index.html">535 U. S. 743</a>, 765.  Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity.  Sossamon\xe2\x80\x99s and Texas\xe2\x80\x99 conflicting plausible arguments about whether immunity is preserved here demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that the Court may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Franklin</em> v. <em>Gwinnett County Public Schools</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/60/index.html">503 U. S. 60</a>, and <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>Gorman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/181/index.html">536 U. S. 181</a>, does not compel a contrary conclusion.  In those cases, where there was no express congressional intent to limit remedies available against municipal entities under an implied right of action, the Court presumed that compensatory damages were available.  <em>Franklin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 73.  But that presumption is irrelevant to construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity, where the question is not whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has given clear direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of RLUIPA \xc2\xa73 pursuant to the Spending Clause put the States on notice that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available for a breach of contract.  While acknowledging the contract-law analogy, this Court has been clear \xe2\x80\x9cnot [to] imply \xe2\x80\xa6 that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barnes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 188, n.\xc2\xa02, or to rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against the States.  Applying ordinary contract principles here would also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique: They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance.  More fundamentally, Sossamon\xe2\x80\x99s implied-contract remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Sossamon also errs in arguing that Texas was put on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by \xc2\xa71003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, which expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of \xe2\x80\x9csection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x937.  Even if such a residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, RLUIPA \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x94which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial burden[s]\xe2\x80\x9d on religious exercise\xe2\x80\x94is not unequivocally a \xe2\x80\x9cstatute prohibiting discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa71003\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  All the statutory provisions enumerated in \xc2\xa71003 explicitly prohibit discrimination; a State might reasonably conclude that the residual clause, strictly construed, covers only provisions using the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">560 F.\xc2\xa03d 316, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined.

Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.

S. 212</a> (1999), that \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d relief, by itself, does not unambiguously include damages against a sovereign.  The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cthrough appropriate remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d could require the Federal Government to pay damages.  42 U.

The dissent argued that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedies\xe2\x80\x9d did not authorize damages \xe2\x80\x9cin express and unequivocal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gibson</em>, 527 U. S., at 226 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  The Court apparently did not disagree but reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedies\xe2\x80\x9d had a flexible meaning that had expanded to include money damages after a related statute was amended to explicitly allow damages in actions under Title VII.  See <em>id.</em>, at 217\xe2\x80\x93218.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity.  See <em>Dellmuth</em> v. <em>Muth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/index.html">491 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(f).  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cas a claim <em>or defense</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a) (emphasis added).<em> </em>Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be \xe2\x80\x9cconstrued in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Texas also highlights Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of the word \xe2\x80\x9crelief,\xe2\x80\x9d which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature \xe2\x80\xa6 , that a party asks of a court\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.  Strictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign\xe2\x80\x94as we must, see <em>Lane</em>, 518 U.

In those cases, the Court addressed what remedies are available against municipal entities under the <em>implied</em> right of action to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \xc2\xa7202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and \xc2\xa7504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  With no statutory text to interpret, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cpresume[d] the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly indicated otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U.

See <em>Lane</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 196 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eliance on <em>Franklin </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 is misplaced\xe2\x80\x9d in determining whether damages are available against the Federal Government).  The question here is not whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to <em>exclude</em> a damages remedy, see <em>Franklin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 70\xe2\x80\x9371, but whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to <em>include</em> a damages remedy.  The text must \xe2\x80\x9cestablish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nordic Village</em>, 503 U. S., at 34.  In <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes</em>, congressional silence had an entirely different implication than it does here.  Whatever \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d might have meant in those cases does not translate to this context.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted \xc2\xa73 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages.  He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy or not.  Relying on <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Franklin</em>, he asserts that all recipients of federal funding are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generally on notice that [they are] subject \xe2\x80\xa6 to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d including compensatory damages.  Brief for Petitioner 27 (quoting <em>Barnes</em>, 536 U. S., at 187).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have acknowledged the contract-law analogy, but we have been clear \xe2\x80\x9cnot [to] imply \xe2\x80\xa6 that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that\ncontract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 189, n.\xc2\xa02.  We have not relied on the Spending Clause contract analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist under non-spending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against the States, as Sossamon would have us do.  In fact, in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Franklin</em>,<em> </em>the Court discussed the Spending Clause context only as a potential <em>limitation </em>on liability.  See <em>Barnes</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 187\xe2\x80\x93188; <em>Franklin</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 74\xe2\x80\x9375.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/571/index.html">292 U.

It would be bizarre to create an \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocal statement\xe2\x80\x9d rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf. <em>Spector</em> v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/119/index.html">545 U. S. 119</a>, 139 (2005) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sossamon also argues that \xc2\xa71003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x937, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of \xe2\x80\x9csection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x937(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 1003 makes \xe2\x80\x9cremedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) \xe2\x80\xa6 available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x937(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that \xc2\xa73 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of \xc2\xa71003 and therefore \xc2\xa71003 waives Texas\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in \xc2\xa71003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, \xc2\xa73 is not unequivocally a \xe2\x80\x9cstatute prohibiting discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71003.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The text of \xc2\xa73 does not prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, it prohibits \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial burden[s]\xe2\x80\x9d on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of \xc2\xa72 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cland use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 on the basis of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc(b)(2).  A waiver of sovereign immunity must be \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lane</em>, 518 U. S., at 192.

No one disputes that, in accepting federal funds, the States consent to suit for violations of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions; the only question is what relief is available to plaintiffs asserting injury from such violations.  That monetary damages are \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d is, in my view, self-evident.  Under general remedies principles, the usual remedy for a violation of a legal right is damages.  Consistent with these principles, our precedents make clear that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d includes monetary relief.  By adopting a contrary reading of the term, the majority severely undermines the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad protection of religious exercise\xe2\x80\x9d Congress intended the statute to provide.  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(g).

As with all waivers of sovereign immunity, the question is whether the State has unequivocally consented to suit in federal court.  See <em>College Savings Bank</em>, 527 U.

The reason for requiring notice is simple: \xe2\x80\x9cStates cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are \xe2\x80\x98unaware\xe2\x80\x99 or which they are \xe2\x80\x98unable to ascertain.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 296 (quoting <em>Pennhurst</em>, 451 U.

The statute states that \xe2\x80\x9cprogram[s] or activit[ies] that receiv[e] Federal financial assistance\xe2\x80\x9d may not impose a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931.  When such a burden has been imposed, the victim \xe2\x80\x9cmay assert a violation of [RLUIPA] as a claim \xe2\x80\xa6 in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a), which the statute defines, as relevant, as \xe2\x80\x9ca State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity created under the authority of a State,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x935(4)(A)(i).  Accordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in accepting federal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity to suit by institutionalized persons upon whom it has imposed an unlawful substantial burden.  See <em>Madison</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 474 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 130 (CA4 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cOn its face, RLUIPA \xe2\x80\xa6 creates a private cause of action against the State, and Virginia cannot be heard to claim that it was unaware of this condition\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)); <em>Benning</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 391 F.\xc2\xa03d 1299, 1305 (CA11 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress unambiguously required states to waive their sovereign immunity from suits filed by prisoners to enforce RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d does not provide state officials clear notice that <em>monetary relief</em> will be available against the States, meaning that they could not have waived their immunity with respect to that particular type of liability.

It is unsurprising, therefore, that on more than one occasion Congress has felt it necessary to clarify in the text of a statute that it meant the terms \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d to <em>exclude</em> damages.

In <em>Franklin</em> we made clear that, \xe2\x80\x9cabsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d federal statutes providing a private right of action authorize all \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief,\xe2\x80\x9d including damages, against violators of its substantive terms.  503 U. S., at 70\xe2\x80\x9371, 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  We reiterated this principle in <em>Barnes</em> v. <em>Gorman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/181/index.html">536 U.

See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/629/index.html">526 U. S. 629</a>, 640 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Spending Clause \xe2\x80\xa6 private damages actions are available\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Gebser</em> v. <em>Lago Vista Independent School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/274/index.html">524 U.

It would be an odd derogation of the normal rules of statutory construction for state officials reading RLUIPA to assume that Congress drafted the statute in ignorance of these unambiguous precedents.  See <em>Merck &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Reynolds</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe normally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, it is difficult to understand the basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a) fails to provide state officials with clear notice that waiving sovereign immunity to monetary relief is a condition of accepting federal funds.  In arguing that \xe2\x80\x9ca waiver of sovereign immunity <em>to other types of relief</em> does not waive immunity to damages,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6 (emphasis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable relief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs.  See <em>Madison</em>, 474 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 131 (holding that a RLUIPA plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaims for equitable relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment to Texas on one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s RLUIPA claims for declaratory and injunctive relief).  The explanation for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s implicit acceptance of suits for injunctive and declaratory relief is obvious enough: It would be a particularly curious reading of the statute to conclude that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express provision of a private right of action to seek \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9ca State\xe2\x80\x9d nonetheless left plaintiffs suing for state violations of RLUIPA with <em>no</em> available relief.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not apparent, however, why the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d is too ambiguous to secure a waiver of state sovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear enough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief.  The majority appears to believe that equitable relief is a \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d remedy for a state violation of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions but monetary relief is not; therefore, a state official reading the \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended and ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d will be unaware that it includes damages but fully apprised that it makes equitable relief available.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  But sovereign immunity is not simply a defense against certain classes of remedies\xe2\x80\x94it is a defense against being sued at all.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/743/index.html">535 U. S. 743</a>, 766 (2002).  As a result, there is no inherent reason why the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d would provide adequate notice as to equitable remedies but not as to monetary ones.  In fact, as discussed earlier, in light of general remedies principles the presumption arguably should be the reverse.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d for statutory violations \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the defendant is a sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  There can be little doubt, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriateness\xe2\x80\x9d of relief to be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by the nature of the injury to his legal rights.  See <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U. S., at 76 (concluding that monetary damages were \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d because equitable relief offered no redress for the injury suffered); see also <em>Milliken</em> v. <em>Bradley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/267/index.html">433 U. S. 267</a>, 280 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he nature of the \xe2\x80\xa6 remedy is to be determined by the nature and scope of the \xe2\x80\xa6 violation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U.

In support of its proposition the majority cites only to a case in which we expressly <em>rejected</em> the argument that state sovereign immunity operates differently according to what type of relief is sought.  See <em>Federal Maritime</em>, 535 U. S., at 765 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of whether a private plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit is for monetary damages or some other type of relief\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>id.</em>, at 769 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he primary function of sovereign immunity is not to protect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect due sovereign entities\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  Nor is the basis for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view apparent from the other cases that it cites.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments in support of its holding also fail to persuade.  The majority contends that the use of a \xe2\x80\x9ccontext-dependent\xe2\x80\x9d word like \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily renders the provision ambiguous.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may vary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in a given case does not render \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a) ambiguous; it simply means that Congress meant for that provision to be comprehensive.

See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9crelief: \xe2\x80\xa6 Also termed <em>remedy</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 1296 (\xe2\x80\x9cremedy: \xe2\x80\xa6 The means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; <em>legal or equitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (emphasis added)).  Second, it is inconsistent with our precedent.  See <em>Barnes</em>, 536 U. S., at 185\xe2\x80\x93187 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d includes monetary and injunctive relief).  Third, it is undermined by the fact that, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it necessary to specify that \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d <em>includes</em> injunctive and other equitable relief.  See 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7973i(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to \xe2\x80\x9ccommence a civil action \nfor appropriate relief, including permanent or tempo-\nrary injunction\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437g(a)(6)(A); 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71324a(f)(2); 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71715z\xe2\x80\x934a(b); 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76309(a).  If the term \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d already connotes equitable relief\xe2\x80\x94and <em>only</em> equitable relief\xe2\x80\x94additional explication is redundant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to this case advance opposing \xe2\x80\x9cplausible arguments\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the correct interpretation of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s text, we must conclude that the statute is ambiguous.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  This view of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descriptive matter.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Carcieri</em> v. <em>Salazar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/379/index.html">555 U. S. 379</a>, 390 (2009) (reviewing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 conflicting textual interpretations of a statute but concluding that it was unambiguous nonetheless).  Moreover, I cannot agree with the majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively the text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 strategic arguments.  If this were true, there would be few cases in which we would be able to decide that a statute was unambiguous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that States accepting federal funds have not consented to suit for monetary relief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availability of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms and the principles animating our relevant precedents.  In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity where none is to be found.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is another reason to question the soundness of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a) severely undermines Congress\xe2\x80\x99 unmistakably stated intent in passing the statute: to afford \xe2\x80\x9cbroad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the statute] and the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(g).  I find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory purpose and the history of \xe2\x80\x9clong-running congressional efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/709/index.html">544 U. S. 709</a>, 714 (2005), state officials would read RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s relief provision in the same limited manner the majority does.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 second attempt to guarantee by statute the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad protection\xe2\x80\x9d of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted as a constitutional matter in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U. S. 872</a> (1990).  As we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA Congress was clearly concerned that state institutions regularly imposed \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous or arbitrary barriers imped[ing] institutionalized persons\xe2\x80\x99 religious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cutter</em>, 544 U. S., at 716 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint statement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of resources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in egregious and unnecessary ways\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cInstitutional residents\xe2\x80\x99 rights to practice their faith is at the mercy of those running the institution \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is difficult to believe that Congress would have devoted such care and effort to establishing significant statutory protections for religious exercise and specifically extended those protections to persons in state institutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a crucial tool for securing the rights the statute guarantees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for violations of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that plaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be forced to seek enforcement of those rights with one hand tied behind their backs.  Most obviously, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s categorical denial of monetary relief means that a plaintiff who prevails on the merits of his claim that a State has substantially burdened his religious exercise will often be denied redress for the injury he has suffered, because in many instances \xe2\x80\x9cprospective relief accords \xe2\x80\xa6 no remedy at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Franklin</em>, 503 U. S., at 76; see H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 2, p.\xc2\xa025 (1991) (Report of Committee on the Judiciary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe limitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means that victims \xe2\x80\xa6 may not recover for the very real effects of the [statutory violation]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Injunctive relief from a federal court may address a violation going forward, but this \nfact will be of cold comfort to the victims of serious, non-recurring violations for which equitable relief may be inappropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the unavailability of monetary relief will effectively shield unlawful policies and practices from judicial review in many cases.  Under state law, discretion to transfer prisoners \xe2\x80\x9cin a wide variety of circumstances is vested in prison officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Meachum</em> v. <em>Fano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/index.html">427 U. S. 215</a>, 227 (1976).  A number of RLUIPA suits seeking injunctive relief have been dismissed as moot because the plaintiff was transferred from the institution where the alleged violation took place prior to adjudication on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Colvin</em> v. <em>Caruso</em>, 605 F.\xc2\xa03d 282, 287, 289 (CA6 2010); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Herrera</em>, No. C 09\xe2\x80\x930318 JSW (PR), 2010 WL 1233815, *3 (ND Cal., Mar. 26, 2010); see generally Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>8\xe2\x80\x9311.  Absent a damages remedy, longstanding RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a case or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on the federal court.  Cf. <em>Moussazadeh</em> v. <em>Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice</em>, Civ. Action No. G\xe2\x80\x9307\xe2\x80\x93574, 2009 WL 819497, *9 (SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2009) (dismissing as moot plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s RLUIPA claim because he had been transferred to a facility that provided kosher food), remanded, 364 Fed. Appx. 110 (CA5 2010); Opening Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant in <em>Moussazadeh </em>v. <em>Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice</em>, No. 09\xe2\x80\x9340400 (CA5), p.\xc2\xa011 (noting that transfer to a special facility took place 19 months after the plaintiff filed suit and just before discovery\xe2\x80\x94which had been stayed 12 months for negotiation\xe2\x80\x94was scheduled to recommence).  Or, as happened in this case, officials may change the policy while litigation is pending.  The fact of \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary cessation\xe2\x80\x9d may allow some of these claims to go forward, but many will nonetheless be dismissed as moot (as happened in this case).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, under the rule the majority announces, Congress can revise RLUIPA to provide specifically for monetary relief against the States, perhaps by inserting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincluding monetary relief\xe2\x80\x9d into the text of \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x932(a).  But we have never demanded that a waiver be presented in a particular formulation to be effective; we only require that it be clear.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Jordan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/index.html">415 U. S. 651</a>, 673 (1974) (holding that waiver may be found in \xe2\x80\x9cexpress language\xe2\x80\x9d or by \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming implications from the text\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In holding to the contrary, the majority erects a formalistic barrier to the vindication of statutory rights deliberately provided for by Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More problematically, because there is no apparent reason why the term \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficiently clear as to equitable relief but not as to monetary relief, we are left with the very real possibility that, in order to secure a waiver of immunity under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s new rule, Congress must now itemize in the statutory text every type of relief meant to be available against sovereign defendants.  I, for one, do not relish the prospect of federal courts being presented with endless state challenges to all manner of federal statutes, on the ground that Congress failed to predict that a laundry list of terms must be included to waive sovereign immunity to all forms of relief.  I would avoid the problems the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision invites and hold instead that, as is the case here, when a general statutory term like \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d is used, clear no-tice has been provided and a State\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of federal funds constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity to all relief, equitable and monetary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained above, nothing in our precedent demands the result the majority reaches today.  The conclusion that RLUIPA fails to provide States with sufficient notice that they are liable for monetary relief cannot be squared with the straightforward terms of the statute and the general principles evident in our prior cases.  For these reasons, and because the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision significantly undermines Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to provide needed redress for violations of individuals\xe2\x80\x99 rights under federal law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Though the Court reserves the general question whether RLUIPA is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under the Spending Clause, see <em>ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01, there is apparently no disagreement among the Federal Courts of Appeals, see 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery circuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has concluded that it is constitutional under at least that power\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that our use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9cput the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa06.  The majority misperceives the point.  <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes</em> simply confirmed what otherwise would have been already apparent to any informed reader of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x94when it comes to remedying injuries to legal rights, monetary damages are \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, as noted in the text, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, the Administrative Procedure Act expressly excludes \xe2\x80\x9cmoney damages\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d available against the United States, suggesting that Congress understands the term normally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant enjoys sovereign immunity.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702; <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/879/index.html">487 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa08.  It is well-established, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law \xe2\x80\xa6 principles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Astoria Fed.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (concluding that, in light of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral principles of maritime tort law\xe2\x80\x9d punitive damages were a remedy available to the plaintiff (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Why Texas\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity defense renders this approach improper is a mystery the majority opinion leaves unsolved.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In <em>Lane</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/187/index.html">518 U.

S. 96</a> (1989), we simply reaffirmed the principle that a sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s liability for damages must be unambiguously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as demonstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement.  The majority tellingly relies on the <em>dissent\xe2\x80\x99s</em> assertion in <em>West</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/212/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/212/index.html">527 U.

Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not mandate the conclusion it draws today.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, because Section 3 of RLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprovisio[n] of [a] \xe2\x80\xa6 Federal statute prohibiting discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x937(a)(1), the latter statute\xe2\x80\x99s waiver provision does not put the States on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  It bears noting, however, that Section 2 of RLUIPA explicitly prohibits discrimination in land use regulation.  See \xc2\xa72000cc(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates \xe2\x80\xa6 on the basis of religion or religious denomination\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case means that some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages against a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s provision of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d applies equally to suits for violations of the terms of both Section 2 and Section 3.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Parents Involved in Community Schools</em> v. <em>Seattle School Dist.
