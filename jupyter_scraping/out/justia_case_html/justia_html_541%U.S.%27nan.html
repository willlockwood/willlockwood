After respondent Reese appealed his state convictions and sentences and the lower state courts denied him collateral relief, the Oregon Supreme Court denied him discretionary review.  His subsequent federal habeas petition raised, <em>inter alia</em>, a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim.  The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presented\xe2\x80\x9d this claim to the state courts because his state appeals court brief had not indicated that he was complaining about a <em>federal</em> law violation.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement satisfied because the State Supreme Court justices had had the <em>opportunity</em> to read the lower court decision before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.  And, had they read that opinion, they would have, or should have, realized that his claim rested upon federal law.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A state prisoner ordinarily does not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly present\xe2\x80\x9d a federal claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, a brief, or similar papers to find material that will alert it to the presence of such a claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Assuming that Reese\xe2\x80\x99s petition by itself did not properly alert the State Supreme Court to the federal nature of his claim, Reese failed to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  To say that a petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presents\xe2\x80\x9d a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading the lower court opinions is to say that those judges <em>must</em> read those opinions\xe2\x80\x94for otherwise they would forfeit the State\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to decide the claim in the first instance.  Federal habeas law does not impose such a requirement.  That requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices, since they do not necessarily read lower court opinions in every case.  And it would impose a serious burden upon those judges with discretionary review powers, whose heavy workloads would be significantly increased if they had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.  Finally, the requirement is unnecessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek federal habeas.  A litigant can easily indicate his claim\xe2\x80\x99s federal law basis in a petition or brief, for example, by citing to the federal source of law on which he relies or simply labeling the claim \xe2\x80\x9cfederal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court is not wrong to assume that Reese\xe2\x80\x99s petition <em>by itself</em> failed to alert the State Supreme Court to his claim\xe2\x80\x99s federal nature.  He must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a federal claim, cite any case that might have alerted the court to his claim\xe2\x80\x99s alleged federal nature, or even contain a factual description supporting his claim.  Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presents\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claim because (1) \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal law claims, and (2) the state law standards for adjudicating state and federal \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claims are identical.  This Court rejects his first argument because he has not demonstrated that state law uses \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d as referring only to a federal law, rather than a similar state law, claim.  However, Reese\xe2\x80\x99s second argument was not addressed by, or presented to, the Ninth Circuit, and first appeared here in Reese\xe2\x80\x99s merits brief.  Because the issue is complex and lower court consideration would help in its resolution, the Court, without expressing any view on the issue\xe2\x80\x99s merits, exercises its Rule 15.2 discretion and deems the argument waived.

This case focuses upon the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michael Reese, the respondent, appealed his state court kidnaping and attempted sodomy convictions and sentences through Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s state court system.  He then brought collateral relief proceedings in the state courts (where he was represented by appointed counsel).  After the lower courts denied him collateral relief, Reese filed a petition for discretionary review in the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition made several different legal claims. In relevant part, the petition asserted that Reese had received \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of both trial court and appellate court counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 47.  The petition added that \xe2\x80\x9chis imprisonment is in violation of [Oregon state law].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.  It said that his <em>trial </em>counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated several provisions of the <em>Federal </em>Constitution.  <em>Ibid</em>.  But it did not say that his separate <em>appellate</em> \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claim violated <em>federal </em>law.  The Oregon Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his <em>appellate </em>counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state court appeals.  The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presented\xe2\x80\x9d his federal \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x9d claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of <em>federal</em> law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.  282 F.\xc2\xa03d 1184 (2002).  Although the majority apparently believed that Reese\xe2\x80\x99s petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claim, it did not find that fact determinative.  <em>Id</em>., at 1193\xe2\x80\x931194.  Rather, it found that Reese had satisfied the \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>opportunity</em> to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1194 (emphasis added).  <em>Had they read the opinion of the lower state trial court, </em>the majority added, the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese\xe2\x80\x99s claim rested upon federal law.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin by assuming that Reese\xe2\x80\x99s petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  On that assumption, Reese failed to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cfair presentation\xe2\x80\x9d standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an \xe2\x80\x9copportunity\xe2\x80\x9d to read the lower court opinions in Reese\xe2\x80\x99s case.  That opportunity means that the judges <em>could have </em>read them.  But to say that a petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presents\xe2\x80\x9d a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges <em>must </em>read the lower court opinions\xe2\x80\x94for otherwise they would forfeit the State\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.  In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.  Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.   Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.  That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, <em>i.e.</em>, whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.  In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.  And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.  Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.  And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding appropriate authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.  Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.  See National Center for State Courts<em>, </em>State Courts Caseload Statistics 2002, pp. 106\xe2\x80\x93110 (Table 2) (for example, in 2001, Oregon appellate courts received a total of 5,341 appeals, including 908 petitions for discretionary review to its Supreme Court; California appellate courts received 32,273, including 8,860 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Louisiana appellate courts received 13,117, including 3,230 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Illinois appellate courts received 12,411, including 2,325 discretionary Supreme Court petitions).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.  A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \xe2\x80\x9cfederal.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.  We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly present\xe2\x80\x9d a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition <em>by itself </em>failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  We do not agree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x9d refer to a federal claim.  The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to <em>other </em>claims but not in respect to this one.  The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.  And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.  Cf. <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Netherland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/152/index.html">518 U. S. 152</a>, 163 (1996); <em>Duncan</em>, 513 U. S., at 366.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presents\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance of appellate counsel\xe2\x80\x9d claim for two reasons.  First, he says that the word \xe2\x80\x9cineffective\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal law claims and not to similar state law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>inadequate</em> assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claims.  And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cineffective,\xe2\x80\x9d that his claim was federal. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal law claim.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lichau </em>v.<em> Baldwin</em>, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207, 1210, 1211 (2000) (using \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ineffective</em> assistance\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution), rev\xe2\x80\x99d in part, 333 Ore. 350, 39 P.\xc2\xa03d 851 (2002).  Indeed, Reese\xe2\x80\x99s own petition uses both phrases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate assistance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claims are identical.  He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim\xe2\x80\x99s federal nature, because, by raising a state law claim, he would necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cfairly present\xe2\x80\x9d the corresponding federal claim.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.  Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese\xe2\x80\x99s brief on the merits.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2, \xe2\x80\x9ca nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Caterpillar Inc. </em>v.<em> Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html">519 U. S. 61</a>, 75, n.\xc2\xa013 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument falls squarely within the rule.  The complex nature of Reese\xe2\x80\x99s claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.  Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>Galen of Va., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/249/index.html">525 U. S. 249</a>, 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (1999) <em>(per curiam)</em>; <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/160/index.html">526 U.
