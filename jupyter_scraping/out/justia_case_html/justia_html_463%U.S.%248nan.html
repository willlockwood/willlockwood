S. 250</a></p><p> the two years since her birth.  The appellant, Jonathan Lehr, claims that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Stanley v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html">405 U. S. 645</a></span> (1972), and <em>Caban v.

S. 380</a></span> (1979), give him an absolute right to notice and an opportunity to be heard before the child may be adopted.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>Jessica M. was born out of wedlock on November 9, 1976.  Her mother, Lorraine Robertson, married Richard Robertson eight months after Jessica\'s birth. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On December 21, 1978, when Jessica was over two years old, the Robertsons filed an adoption petition in the Family Court of Ulster County, New York.  The court heard their testimony and received a favorable report from the Ulster County Department of Social Services.  On March 7, 1979, the court entered an order of adoption. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In this proceeding, appellant contends that the adoption order is invalid because he, Jessica\'s putative father, was not given advance notice of the adoption proceeding. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The State of New York maintains a "putative father registry." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  A man who files with that registry demonstrates his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 463 U. S. 251</a></p><p> intent to claim paternity of a child born out of wedlock, and is therefore entitled to receive notice of any proceeding to adopt that child.  Before entering Jessica\'s adoption order, the Ulster County Family Court had the putative father registry examined.  Although appellant claims to be Jessica\'s natural father, he had not entered his name in the registry.</p>\n<p>In addition to the persons whose names are listed on the putative father registry, New York law requires that notice of an adoption proceeding be given to several other classes of possible fathers of children born out of wedlock -- those who have been adjudicated to be the father, those who have been identified as the father on the child\'s birth certificate, those who live openly with the child and the child\'s mother and who hold themselves out to be the father, those who have been identified as the father by the mother in a sworn written statement, and those who were married to the child\'s mother before the child was six months old. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Appellant admittedly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 463 U. S. 252</a></p><p> was not a member of any of those classes.  He had lived with appellee prior to Jessica\'s birth and visited her in the hospital when Jessica was born, but his name does not appear on Jessica\'s birth certificate.  He did not live with appellee or Jessica after Jessica\'s birth, he has never provided them with any financial support, and he has never offered to marry appellee.  Nevertheless, he contends that the following special circumstances gave him a constitutional right to notice and a hearing before Jessica was adopted.</p>\n<p>On January 30, 1979, one month after the adoption proceeding was commenced in Ulster County, appellant filed a "visitation and paternity petition" in the Westchester County Family Court.  In that petition, he asked for a determination of paternity, an order of support, and reasonable visitation privileges with Jessica.  Notice of that proceeding was served on appellee on February 22, 1979.  Four days later, appellee\'s attorney informed the Ulster County Court that appellant had commenced a paternity proceeding in Westchester County; the Ulster County judge then entered an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 463 U. S. 253</a></p><p> order staying appellant\'s paternity proceeding until he could rule on a motion to change the venue of that proceeding to Ulster County.  On March 3, 1979, appellant received notice of the change of venue motion and, for the first time, learned that an adoption proceeding was pending in Ulster County.</p>\n<p>On March 7, 1979, appellant\'s attorney telephoned the Ulster County judge to inform him that he planned to seek a stay of the adoption proceeding pending the determination of the paternity petition.  In that telephone conversation, the judge advised the lawyer that he had already signed the adoption order earlier that day.  According to appellant\'s attorney, the judge stated that he was aware of the pending paternity petition, but did not believe he was required to give notice to appellant prior to the entry of the order of adoption.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, the Family Court in Westchester County granted appellee\'s motion to dismiss the paternity petition, holding that the putative father\'s right to seek paternity "must be deemed severed so long as an order of adoption exists."  App. 228.  Appellant did not appeal from that dismissal. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  On June 22, 1979, appellant filed a petition to vacate the order of adoption on the ground that it was obtained by fraud and in violation of his constitutional rights.  The Ulster County Family Court received written and oral argument on the question whether it had "dropped the ball" by approving the adoption without giving appellant advance notice.  Tr. 53.  After deliberating for several months, it denied the petition, explaining its decision in a thorough written opinion.  <em>In re Adoption of Martz,</em> 102 Misc.2d 102, 423 N.Y.S.2d 378 (1979).</p>\n<p>The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court affirmed.  <em>In re Adoption of Jessica "XX,"</em> 77 App.Div.2d 381, 434 N.Y.S.2d 772 (1980).  The majority held that appellant\'s commencement of a paternity action did not give him any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 463 U. S. 254</a></p><p> right to receive notice of the adoption proceeding, that the notice provisions of the statute were constitutional, and that <em>Caban v. Mohammed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/380/case.html">441 U. S. 380</a></span> (1979), was not retroactive. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Parenthetically, the majority observed that appellant "could have insured his right to notice by signing the putative father registry."  77 App.Div.2d at 383, 434 N.Y.S.2d at 774.  One justice dissented on the ground that the filing of the paternity proceeding should have been viewed as the statutory equivalent of filing a notice of intent to claim paternity with the putative father registry.</p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals also affirmed by a divided vote.  <em>In re Adoption of Jessica "XX,"</em> 54 N.Y.2d 417, 430 N.E.2d 896 (1981).  The majority first held that it did not need to consider whether our decision in <em>Caban</em> affected appellant\'s claim that he had a right to notice, because <em>Caban</em> was not retroactive. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It then rejected the argument that the mother had been guilty of a fraud upon the court.  Finally, it addressed what it described as the only contention of substance advanced by appellant:  that it was an abuse of discretion to enter the adoption order without requiring that notice be given to appellant.  The court observed that the primary purpose of the notice provision of \xc2\xa7 111-a was to enable the person served to provide the court with evidence concerning the best interest of the child, and that appellant had made no tender indicating any ability to provide any particular or special information relevant to Jessica\'s best interest.  Considering the record as a whole, and acknowledging that it might have been prudent to give notice, the court concluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 463 U. S. 255</a></p><p> that the Family Court had not abused its discretion either when it entered the order without notice or when it denied appellant\'s petition to reopen the proceedings.  The dissenting judges concluded that the Family Court had abused its discretion both when it entered the order without notice and when it refused to reopen the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Appellant has now invoked our appellate jurisdiction. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  He offers two alternative grounds for holding the New York statutory scheme unconstitutional.  First, he contends that a putative father\'s actual or potential relationship with a child born out of wedlock is an interest in liberty which may not be destroyed without due process of law; he argues therefore that he had a constitutional right to prior notice and an opportunity to be heard before he was deprived of that interest.  Second, he contends that the gender-based classification in the statute, which both denied him the right to consent to Jessica\'s adoption and accorded him fewer procedural rights than her mother, violated the Equal Protection Clause. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 463 U. S. 256</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>The Due Process Claim.</em></p>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.  When that Clause is invoked in a novel context, it is our practice to begin the inquiry with a determination of the precise nature of the private interest that is threatened by the State.  <em>See, e.g., Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/886/case.html">367 U. S. 886</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/886/case.html#895">367 U. S. 895</a></span>-896 (1961).  Only after that interest has been identified can we properly evaluate the adequacy of the State\'s process.  <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/case.html">408 U. S. 471</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/case.html#482">408 U. S. 482</a></span>-483 (1972).  We therefore first consider the nature of the interest in liberty for which appellant claims constitutional protection, and then turn to a discussion of the adequacy of the procedure that New York has provided for its protection.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The intangible fibers that connect parent and child have infinite variety.  They are woven throughout the fabric of our society, providing it with strength, beauty, and flexibility.  It is self-evident that they are sufficiently vital to merit constitutional protection in appropriate cases.  In deciding whether this is such a case, however, we must consider the broad framework that has traditionally been used to resolve the legal problems arising from the parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, state law determines the final outcome.  <em>Cf. United States v. Yazell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/341/case.html">382 U. S. 341</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/341/case.html#351">382 U. S. 351</a></span>-353 (1966).  Rules governing the inheritance of property, adoption, and child custody are generally specified in statutory enactments that vary from State to State. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Moreover, equally varied state laws governing marriage and divorce affect a multitude of parent-child relationships.  The institution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 463 U. S. 257</a></p><p> of marriage has played a critical role both in defining the legal entitlements of family members and in developing the decentralized structure of our democratic society. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In recognition of that role, and as part of their general overarching concern for serving the best interests of children, state laws almost universally express an appropriate preference for the formal family. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>In some cases, however, this Court has held that the Federal Constitution supersedes state law and provides even greater protection for certain formal family relationships.  In those cases, as in the state cases, the Court has emphasized the paramount interest in the welfare of children, and has noted that the rights of the parents are a counterpart of the responsibilities they have assumed.  Thus, the "liberty" of parents to control the education of their children that was vindicated in <em>Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/case.html">262 U. S. 390</a></span> (1923), and <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html">268 U. S. 510</a></span> (1925), was described as a "right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [the child] for additional obligations."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html#535">268 U. S. 535</a></span>.  The linkage between parental duty and parental right was stressed again in <em>Prince v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/case.html">321 U. S. 158</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/case.html#166">321 U. S. 166</a></span> (1944), when the Court declared it a cardinal principle</p>\n<p>"that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 463 U. S. 258</a></p><p> first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In these cases, the Court has found that the relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection.  <em>See also Moore v. Cty of East Cleveland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html">431 U. S. 494</a></span> (1977) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>"[S]tate intervention to terminate [such a] relationship . . . must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the Due Process Clause."</p>\n<p><em>Santosky v. Kramer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html">455 U. S. 745</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#753">455 U. S. 753</a></span> (1982).</p>\n<p>There are also a few cases in which this Court has considered the extent to which the Constitution affords protection to the relationship between natural parents and children born out of wedlock.  In some, we have been concerned with the rights of the children, <em>see, e.g., Trimble v. Gordon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/762/case.html">430 U. S. 762</a></span> (1977); <em>Jimenez v. Weinberger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/628/case.html">417 U. S. 628</a></span> (1974); <em>Weber v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/164/case.html">406 U. S. 164</a></span> (1972).  In this case, however, it is a parent who claims that the State has improperly deprived him of a protected interest in liberty.  This Court has examined the extent to which a natural father\'s biological relationship with his child receives protection under the Due Process Clause in precisely three cases:  <em>Stanley v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html">405 U. S. 645</a></span> (1972), <em>Quilloin v. Walcott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/246/case.html">434 U. S. 246</a></span> (1978), and <em>Caban v. Mohammed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/380/case.html">441 U.

The father in that case had lived with his children all their lives, and had lived with their mother for 18 years.  There was nothing in the record to indicate that Stanley had been a neglectful father who had not cared for his children. 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html#655">405 U.

The father in that case had never legitimated the child.  It was only after the mother had remarried and her new husband had filed an adoption petition that the natural father sought visitation rights and filed a petition for legitimation.

Because this Court upheld his equal protection claim, the majority did not address his due process challenge.  The comments on the latter claim by the four dissenting Justices are nevertheless instructive, because they identify the clear distinction between a mere biological </p><p><a class="page-number" name="260">Page 463 U.

S. 262</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.  If he grasps that opportunity and accepts some measure of responsibility for the child\'s future, he may enjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child\'s development. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  If he fails to do so, the Federal Constitution will not automatically compel a State to listen to his opinion of where the child\'s best interests lie.</p>\n<p>In this case, we are not assessing the constitutional adequacy of New York\'s procedures for terminating a developed relationship.  Appellant has never had any significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with Jessica, and he did not seek to establish a legal tie until after she was two years old. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  We are concerned only with whether New York </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 463 U. S. 263</a></p><p> has adequately protected his opportunity to form such a relationship.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The most effective protection of the putative father\'s opportunity to develop a relationship with his child is provided by the laws that authorize formal marriage and govern its consequences.  But the availability of that protection is, of course, dependent on the will of both parents of the child.  Thus, New York has adopted a special statutory scheme to protect the unmarried father\'s interest in assuming a responsible role in the future of his child.</p>\n<p>After this Court\'s decision in <em>Stanley,</em> the New York Legislature appointed a special commission to recommend legislation that would accommodate both the interests of biological fathers in their children and the children\'s interest in prompt and certain adoption procedures.  The commission recommended, and the legislature enacted, a statutory adoption scheme that automatically provides notice to seven categories of putative fathers who are likely to have assumed some responsibility for the care of their natural children. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  If </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 463 U. S. 264</a></p><p> this scheme were likely to omit many responsible fathers, and if qualification for notice were beyond the control of an interested putative father, it might be thought procedurally inadequate.  Yet, as all of the New York courts that reviewed this matter observed, the right to receive notice was completely within appellant\'s control.  By mailing a postcard to the putative father registry, he could have guaranteed that he would receive notice of any proceedings to adopt Jessica.  The possibility that he may have failed to do so because of his ignorance of the law cannot be a sufficient reason for criticizing the law itself.  The New York Legislature concluded that a more open-ended notice requirement would merely complicate the adoption process, threaten the privacy interests of unwed mothers, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] create the risk of unnecessary controversy, and impair the desired finality of adoption decrees.  Regardless of whether we would have done likewise if we were legislators instead of judges, we surely cannot characterize the State\'s conclusion as arbitrary. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant argues, however, that even if the putative father\'s opportunity to establish a relationship with an illegitimate child is adequately protected by the New York statutory scheme in the normal case, he was nevertheless entitled </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 463 U. S. 265</a></p><p> to special notice because the court and the mother knew that he had filed an affiliation proceeding in another court.  This argument amounts to nothing more than an indirect attack on the notice provisions of the New York statute.  The legitimate state interests in facilitating the adoption of young children and having the adoption proceeding completed expeditiously that underlie the entire statutory scheme also justify a trial judge\'s determination to require all interested parties to adhere precisely to the procedural requirements of the statute.  The Constitution does not require either a trial judge or a litigant to give special notice to nonparties who are presumptively capable of asserting and protecting their own rights. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Since the New York statutes adequately protected appellant\'s inchoate interest in establishing a relationship with Jessica, we find no merit in the claim that his constitutional rights were offended because the Family Court strictly complied with the notice provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p><em>The Equal Protection Claim.</em></p>\n<p>The concept of equal justice under law requires the State to govern impartially.  <em>New York City Transit Authority v.

Those procedures are designed to promote the best interests of the child, to protect the rights of interested third parties, and to ensure promptness and finality. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  To serve those ends, the legislation guarantees to certain people the right to veto an adoption and the right to prior notice of any adoption proceeding.  The mother of an illegitimate child is always within that favored class, but only certain putative fathers are included.  Appellant contends that the gender-based distinction is invidious.</p>\n<p>As we have already explained, the existence or nonexistence of a substantial relationship between parent and child is a relevant criterion in evaluating both the rights of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="267">Page 463 U. S. 267</a></p><p> parent and the best interests of the child.  In <em>Quilloin v. Walcott,</em> we noted that the putative father, like appellant,</p>\n<p>"ha[d] never shouldered any significant responsibility with respect to the daily supervision, education, protection, or care of the child.

We therefore found that a Georgia statute that always required a mother\'s consent to the adoption of a child born out of wedlock, but required the father\'s consent only if he had legitimated the child, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Because appellant, like the father in <em>Quilloin,</em> has never established a substantial relationship with his daughter, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/248/case.html#262">463 U.

The Court made it clear, however, that, if the father had not</p>\n<p>"come forward to participate in the rearing of his child, nothing in the Equal Protection Clause [would] preclud[e] the State from withholding from him the privilege of vetoing the adoption of that child."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/380/case.html#392">441 U.

Throughout the pregnancy and after the birth, Lorraine acknowledged to friends and relatives that Lehr was Jessica\'s father; Lorraine told Lehr that she had reported to the New York State Department of Social Services that he was the father. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Lehr visited Lorraine and Jessica in the hospital every day during Lorraine\'s confinement.  According to Lehr, from the time Lorraine was discharged from the hospital until August, 1978, she concealed her whereabouts from him.  During this time, Lehr never ceased his efforts to locate Lorraine and Jessica, and achieved sporadic success until August, 1977, after which time he was unable to locate them at all.  On those occasions when he did determine Lorraine\'s location, he visited with her and her children to the extent she was willing to permit it.  When Lehr, with the aid of a detective agency, located Lorraine and Jessica in August, 1978, Lorraine was already married to Mr. Robertson.  Lehr asserts that, at this time, he offered to provide financial assistance and to set up a trust fund for Jessica, but that Lorraine refused.  Lorraine threatened Lehr with arrest unless he stayed away, and refused to permit him to see Jessica.  Thereafter, Lehr retained counsel who wrote to Lorraine in early December. 1978, requesting that she permit Lehr to visit Jessica and threatening legal action on Lehr\'s behalf.  On December 21, 1978, perhaps as a response to Lehr\'s threatened legal action, appellees commenced the adoption action at issue here.</p>\n<p>The majority posits that</p>\n<p>"[t]he intangible fibers that connect parent and child . . . are sufficiently vital to merit constitutional protection <em>in appropriate cases.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/248/case.html#256">463 U.

If "both the child and the [putative father] in a paternity action have a compelling interest" in the accurate outcome of such a case, <em>ibid.,</em> it cannot be disputed that both the child and the putative father have a compelling interest in the outcome of a proceeding that may result in the termination of the father-child relationship.  "A parent\'s interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is . . . a commanding one."  <em>Lassiter v.

It is beyond dispute that a formal order of adoption, no less than a formal termination proceeding, operates to permanently terminate parental rights.</p>\n<p>Lehr\'s version of the "facts" paints a far different picture than that portrayed by the majority.  The majority\'s recitation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="271">Page 463 U.

S. 262</a></span>, obviously does not tell the whole story.  Appellant has never been afforded an opportunity to present his case.  The legitimation proceeding he instituted was first stayed, and then dismissed, on appellees\' motions.  Nor could appellant establish his interest during the adoption proceedings, for it is the failure to provide Lehr notice and an opportunity to be heard there that is at issue here.  We cannot fairly make a judgment based on the quality or substance of a relationship without a complete and developed factual record.  This case requires us to assume that Lehr\'s allegations are true -- that, but for the actions of the child\'s mother, there would have been the kind of significant relationship that the majority concedes is entitled to the full panoply of procedural due process protections. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>I reject the peculiar notion that the only significance of the biological connection between father and child is that "it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/248/case.html#262">463 U. S. 262</a></span>.  A "mere biological relationship" is not as unimportant in determining the nature of liberty interests as the majority suggests. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="272">Page 463 U. S. 272</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[T]he usual understanding of \'family\' implies biological relationships, and most decisions treating the relation between parent and child have stressed this element."</p>\n<p><em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/816/case.html#843">431 U. S. 843</a></span>.  The "biological connection" is itself a relationship that creates a protected interest.  Thus the "nature" of the interest is the parent-child relationship; how well developed that relationship has become goes to its "weight," not its "nature." [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Whether Lehr\'s interest is entitled to constitutional protection does not entail a searching inquiry into the quality of the relationship, but a simple determination of the <em>fact</em> that the relationship exists -- a fact that even the majority agrees must be assumed to be established.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, however, because there is no established factual basis on which to proceed, it is quite untenable to conclude that a putative father\'s interest in his child is lacking in substance, that the father in effect has abandoned the child, or ultimately that the father\'s interest is not entitled to the same minimum procedural protections as the interests of other putative fathers.  Any analysis of the adequacy of the notice in this case must be conducted on the assumption that the interest involved here is as strong as that of <em>any</em> putative father.  That is not to say that due process requires actual notice to every putative father, or that adoptive parents or the State must conduct an exhaustive search of records or an intensive investigation before a final adoption order may be entered.  The procedures adopted by the State, however, must at least represent a reasonable effort to determine the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 463 U. S. 273</a></p><p> identity of the putative father and to give him adequate notice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In this case, of course, there was no question about either the identity or the location of the putative father.  The mother knew exactly who he was, and both she and the court entering the order of adoption knew precisely where he was and how to give him actual notice that his parental rights were about to be terminated by an adoption order. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Lehr was entitled to due process, and the right to be heard is one of the fundamentals of that right, which</p>\n<p>"\'has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Schroeder v. City of New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/208/case.html">371 U.

S. 314</a></span> (1950).</p>\n<p>The State concedes this much, but insists that Lehr has had all the process that is due to him.  It relies on \xc2\xa7 111-a, which designates seven categories of unwed fathers to whom notice of adoption proceedings must be given, including any unwed father who has filed with the State a notice of his intent to claim paternity.  The State submits that it need not give notice to anyone who has not filed his name, as he is permitted to do, and who is not otherwise within the designated categories, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="274">Page 463 U. S. 274</a></p><p> even if his identity and interest are known or are reasonably ascertainable by the State.</p>\n<p>I am unpersuaded by the State\'s position.  In the first place, \xc2\xa7 111-a defines six categories of unwed fathers to whom notice must be given even though they have not placed their names on file pursuant to the section.  Those six categories, however, do not include fathers such as Lehr, who have initiated filiation proceedings, even though their identity and interest are as clearly and easily ascertainable as those fathers in the six categories.  Initiating such proceedings necessarily involves a formal acknowledgment of paternity, and requiring the State to take note of such a case in connection with pending adoption proceedings would be a trifling burden, no more than the State undertakes when there is a final adjudication in a paternity action. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Indeed, there would appear to be more reason to give notice to those such as Lehr who acknowledge paternity than to those who have been adjudged to be a father in a contested paternity action.</p>\n<p>The State asserts that any problem in this respect is overcome by the seventh category of putative fathers to whom notice must be given, namely, those fathers who have identified themselves in the putative fathers\' register maintained by the State.  Since Lehr did not take advantage of this device to make his interest known, the State contends, he was not entitled to notice and a hearing even though his identity, location, and interest were known to the adoption court prior to entry of the adoption order.  I have difficulty with this position.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="275">Page 463 U. S. 275</a></p><p> First, it represents a grudging and crabbed approach to due process.  The State is quite willing to give notice and a hearing to putative fathers who have made themselves known by resorting to the putative fathers\' register.  It makes little sense to me to deny notice and hearing to a father who has not placed his name in the register but who has unmistakably identified himself by filing suit to establish his paternity and has notified the adoption court of his action and his interest.  I thus need not question the statutory scheme on its face.  Even assuming that Lehr would have been foreclosed if his failure to utilize the register had somehow disadvantaged the State, he effectively made himself known by other means, and it is the sheerest formalism to deny him a hearing because he informed the State in the wrong manner. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>No state interest is substantially served by denying Lehr adequate notice and a hearing.  The State no doubt has an interest in expediting adoption proceedings to prevent a child from remaining unduly long in the custody of the State or foster parents.  But this is not an adoption involving a child in the custody of an authorized state agency.  Here the child is in the custody of the mother, and will remain in her custody.  Moreover, had Lehr utilized the putative fathers\' register, he would have been granted a prompt hearing, and there was no justifiable reason, in terms of delay, to refuse him a hearing in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p>The State\'s undoubted interest in the finality of adoption orders likewise is not well served by a procedure that will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="276">Page 463 U. S. 276</a></p><p> deny notice and a hearing to a father whose identity and location are known.  As this case well illustrates, denying notice and a hearing to such a father may result in years of additional litigation and threaten the reopening of adoption proceedings and the vacation of the adoption.  Here, the Family Court\'s unseemly rush to enter an adoption order after ordering that cause be shown why the filiation proceeding should not be transferred and consolidated with the adoption proceeding can hardly be justified by the interest in finality.  To the contrary, the adoption order entered in March, 1979, has remained open to question until this very day.</p>\n<p>Because, in my view, the failure to provide Lehr with notice and an opportunity to be heard violated rights guaranteed him by the Due Process Clause, I need not address the question whether \xc2\xa7 111-a violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating between categories of unwed fathers or by discriminating on the basis of gender.</p>\n<p>Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority correctly assumes that Lehr is in fact Jessica\'s father.  Indeed, Lehr has admitted paternity, and sought to establish a legal relationship with the child.  It is also noteworthy that the mother has never denied that Lehr is the father.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Under 18 NYCRR \xc2\xa7 369.2(b) (1982), recipients of public assistance in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program are required, as a condition of eligibility, to provide the name and address of the child\'s father.  Lorraine apparently received public assistance after Jessica\'s birth; it is unclear whether she received public assistance after that regulation went into effect in 1977.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In response to our decision in <em>Caban v. Mohammed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/380/case.html">441 U. S. 380</a></span> (1979), the statute governing the persons whose consent is necessary to an adoption has been amended to include certain unwed fathers.  The State has recognized that an unwed father\'s failure to maintain an actual relationship or to communicate with a child will not deprive him of his right to consent if he was "prevented from doing so by the person or authorized agency having lawful custody of the child."  N.Y.Dom.Rel.Law \xc2\xa7 111(1)(d) (McKinney Supp.1982-1983) (as amended by Ch. 575, 1980 N.Y. Laws).  Thus, even the State recognizes that before a lesser standard can be applied consistent with due process requirements, there must be a determination that there was no significant relationship and that the father was not prevented from forming such a relationship.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority\'s citation of <em>Quilloin</em> and <em>Caban</em> as examples that the Constitution does not require the same procedural protections for the interests of all unwed fathers is disingenuous.  Neither case involved notice and opportunity to be heard.  In both, the unwed fathers were notified, and participated as parties in the adoption proceedings.  <em>See Quilloin v. Walcott,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/246/case.html">434 U.

Likewise, there is no reason not to require such identification when it is the spouse of the custodial parent who seeks to adopt the child.  Indeed, the State now requires the mother to provide the identity of the father if she applies for financial benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program.  <em>See</em> <l=|463 248fn2="" 2|="" u.s.="">n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  The State\'s obligation to provide notice to persons before their interests are permanently terminated cannot be a lesser concern than its obligation to assure that state funds are not expended when there exists a person upon whom the financial responsibility should fall.</l=|463></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>There is some indication that the sponsor of the bill that included the notice requirements of \xc2\xa7 111-a believed that a putative father\'s rights would be protected by the filing of a paternity action.  In a letter to the Counsel to the Governor, Senator Pisani stated that a putative father who files with the registry should be expected to keep his address up-to-date, because</p>\n<p>"such a father has elected not to avail himself of his right . . . to initiate a paternity proceeding, but, rather, has chosen the less involved procedure of filing a \'notice of intent,\' which will <em>also</em> protect his right to notice of subsequent proceedings affecting the child."</p>\n<p>App. to Brief for Attorney General of New York 35a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Stanley v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html">405 U. S. 645</a></span> (1972), the Court held that the Constitution forbids a State to remove illegitimate children from their father\'s custody without notice and an opportunity to be heard.  The offensive provision in the Illinois law at issue there was a presumption that an unwed father was not a fit parent.  Today the Court indulges in a similar and equally offensive presumption -- that an unwed father who has not filed a notice of intent to claim paternity has abandoned his child and waived any right to notice and hearing.  This presumption operates regardless of the fact that the father has instituted legal proceedings to establish his rights and obligations.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
