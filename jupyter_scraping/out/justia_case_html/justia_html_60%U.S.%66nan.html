JUSTICE McLEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The action was brought on a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Louisiana; certain matters were set up in the circuit court as a defense, all of which were overruled, and judgment was entered for eighteen hundred and ten dollars, with interest and costs.  The only errors assigned in this Court on which a reversal of the judgment of the circuit court is prayed are:  1, that at the time suit was brought on the judgment in the circuit court, an execution had been issued on the same judgment in the state court which was in full force and on which a seizure had been made, and 2 that the circuit court erred in holding that the indebtment was not founded on a Louisiana contract.</p>\n<p>These exceptions were not taken in the progress of the trial in the circuit court, and do not appear on the record.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 60 U. S. 69</a></p><p> fact that an execution was issued and returned appears in the record of the state court, but it was not made a part of the record of the circuit court by bill of exceptions, and it cannot now be noticed.  There is no ground of error on the face of the record for the action of this Court.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed with ten percent damages.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
