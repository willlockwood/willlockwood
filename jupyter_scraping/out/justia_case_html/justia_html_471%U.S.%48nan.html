(SMCRC), and North Carolina Motor Carriers Association, Inc. (NCMCA), petitioners, are "rate bureaus" composed of motor common carriers operating in four Southeastern States.  The rate bureaus, on behalf of their members, submit joint rate proposals to the Public Service Commission in each State for approval or rejection.  This collective ratemaking is authorized, but not compelled, by the States in which the rate bureaus operate.  The United States, contending that collective ratemaking violates the federal antitrust laws, filed this action to enjoin the rate bureaus\' alleged anticompetitive practices.  We here consider whether the petitioners\' collective ratemaking activities, though not compelled by the States, are entitled to Sherman Act immunity under the "state action" doctrine of <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee, Public Service Commissions set motor common carriers\' rates for the intrastate transportation of general commodities. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Common carriers are required to submit proposed rates to the relevant Commission for approval. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  A proposed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 471 U. S. 51</a></p><p> rate becomes effective if the state agency takes no action within a specified period of time.  If a hearing is scheduled, however, a rate will become effective only after affirmative agency approval. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The State Public Service Commissions thus have and exercise ultimate authority and control over all intrastate rates.</p>\n<p>In all four States, common carriers are allowed to agree on rate proposals prior to their joint submission to the regulatory agency. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  By reducing the number of proposals, collective ratemaking permits the agency to consider more carefully each submission.  In fact, some Public Service Commissions have stated that, without collective ratemaking, they would be unable to function effectively as rate-setting bodies. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Nevertheless, collective ratemaking is not compelled by any of the States; every common carrier remains free to submit individual rate proposals to the Public Service Commissions. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 471 U. S. 52</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As indicated above, SMCRC and NCMCA are private associations composed of motor common carriers operating in North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Both organizations have committees that consider possible rate changes. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  If a rate committee concludes that an intrastate rate should be changed, a collective proposal for the changed rate is submitted to the State Public Service Commission.  Members of the bureau, however, are not bound by the joint proposal.  Any disapproving member may submit an independent rate proposal to the state regulatory Commission. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>On November 17, 1976, the United States instituted this action against SMCRC and NCMCA in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 471 U. S. 53</a></p><p> United States charged that the two rate bureaus had violated \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring with their members to fix rates for the intrastate transportation of general commodities.  The rate bureaus responded that their conduct was exempt from the federal antitrust laws by virtue of the state action doctrine.  <em>See Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  They further asserted that their collective ratemaking activities did not violate the Sherman Act, because the rates ultimately were determined by the appropriate state agencies.  The District Court found the rate bureaus\' arguments meritless, and entered a summary judgment in favor of the Government.  467 F.Supp. 471 (1979).  The defendants were enjoined from engaging in collective ratemaking activities with their members.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Unit B, now the Eleventh Circuit), sitting en banc, affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 702 F.2d 532 (1983). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Relying primarily on <em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U. S. 773</a></span> (1975), the court held that the rate bureaus\' challenged conduct, because it was not compelled by the State, was not entitled to <em>Parker</em> immunity.  The two-pronged test set forth in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html">445 U. S. 97</a></span> (1980), was irrelevant, the court reasoned, for in that case a public official was the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 471 U. S. 54</a></p><p> named defendant. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  702 F.2d at 539.  The Court of Appeals further held that, even if <em>Midcal</em> were applicable to a private party\'s claim of state action immunity, the rate bureaus were not shielded from liability under the Sherman Act.  The court concluded that only if the anticompetitive acts of a private party are compelled can a State\'s policy be held "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed" within the meaning of <em>Midcal.</em>  702 F.2d at 539.</p>\n<p>After finding the rate bureaus not entitled to <em>Parker</em> immunity, the Court of Appeals held that their collective ratemaking activities violated the Sherman Act.  672 F.2d 469, 481 (1982). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  It rejected the rate bureaus\' contention that, because the regulatory agencies had ultimate authority and control over the rates charged, the federal antitrust laws were not violated.  The Court of Appeals found that "joint ratesetting . . . reduce[d] the amount of independent rate filing that otherwise would characterize the market process," and thus raised the prices charged for intrastate transportation of general commodities.  <em>Id.</em> at 478.  This "naked price restraint," the court reasoned, is <em>per se</em> illegal.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Four judges strongly dissented.  They argued that <em>Midcal</em> was applicable to a private party\'s claim of state action immunity.  The success of an antitrust action should depend upon the activity challenged, rather than the identity of the defendant.  702 F.2d at 543-544.  After asserting that <em>Midcal</em> provided the relevant test, the dissenters concluded that the lack of compulsion was not dispositive.  Even in the absence of compulsion, a "state can articulate a clear and express policy."  <em>Id.</em> at 546.  The dissent further concluded that a <em>per se</em> compulsion requirement denies States needed flexibility in the formation of regulatory programs, and thus is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 471 U. S. 55</a></p><p> inconsistent with the principles of federalism that Congress intended to embody in the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] 467 U.S. 1240 (1984), to decide whether petitioners\' collective ratemaking activities, though not compelled by the States in which they operate, are entitled to <em>Parker</em> immunity. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> 317 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span>, this Court held that the Sherman Act was not intended to prohibit States from imposing restraints on competition. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  There, a raisin producer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 471 U. S. 56</a></p><p> filed an action against the California Director of Agriculture to enjoin the enforcement of the State\'s Agricultural Prorate Act.  Under that statute, a cartel of private raisin producers was created in order to stabilize prices and prevent "economic waste."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#346">317 U. S. 346</a></span>.  The Court recognized that the State\'s program was anticompetitive, and it assumed that Congress, "in the exercise of its commerce power, [could] prohibit a state from maintaining [such] a stabilization program. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U. S. 350</a></span>.  Nevertheless, the Court refused to find in the Sherman Act "an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state\'s control over its officers and agents. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#351">317 U. S. 351</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although <em>Parker</em> involved an action against a state official, the Court\'s reasoning extends to suits against private parties.  The <em>Parker</em> decision was premised on the assumption that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, did not intend to compromise the States\' ability to regulate their domestic commerce. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  If <em>Parker</em> immunity were limited to the actions of public officials, this assumed congressional purpose would be frustrated, for a State would be unable to implement programs that restrain competition among private parties.  A plaintiff could frustrate any such program merely by filing suit against the regulated private parties, rather than the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 471 U. S. 57</a></p><p> state officials who implement the plan.  We decline to reduce <em>Parker\'s</em> holding to a formalism that would stand for little more than the proposition that Porter Brown sued the wrong parties.  <em>Cantor v.

Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</em> 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html">445 U. S. 97</a></span>.  <em>See Hallie v.

In <em>Midcal,</em> we affirmed a state court injunction prohibiting officials from enforcing a statute requiring wine producers to establish resale price schedules.  We set forth a two-pronged test for determining whether state regulation of private parties is shielded from the federal antitrust laws.  First, the challenged restraint must be "<em>one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.\'"  445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#105">445 U. S. 105</a></span>, quoting <em>Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html">435 U.

S. 105</a></span>. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  This supervision requirement prevents the State from frustrating the national policy in favor of competition by casting a "gauzy cloak of state involvement" over what is essentially private anticompetitive conduct.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html#106">445 U.

S. 58</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The <em>Midcal</em> test does not expressly provide that the actions of a private party must be compelled by a State in order to be protected from the federal antitrust laws.  The Court of Appeals, however, held that compulsion is a threshold requirement to a finding of <em>Parker</em> immunity.  It reached this conclusion by finding that:  (i) <em>Midcal</em> is inapplicable to suits brought against private parties; (ii) even if <em>Midcal</em> is applicable, private conduct that is not compelled cannot be taken pursuant to a "clearly articulated state policy," within the meaning of <em>Midcal\'s</em> first prong; and (iii) because <em>Goldfarb</em> was cited with approval in <em>Midcal,</em> the <em>Midcal</em> Court endorsed the continued validity of a "compulsion requirement."  We consider these points in order.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that <em>Midcal,</em> that involved a suit against a state agency, is inapplicable where a private party is the named defendant.  <em>Midcal,</em> however, should not be given such a narrow reading.  In that case, we were concerned, as we are here, with state regulation restraining competition among private parties.  Therefore, the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Midcal</em> should be used to determine whether the private rate bureaus\' collective ratemaking activities are protected from the federal antitrust laws.  The success of an antitrust action should depend upon the nature of the activity challenged, rather than on the identity of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 471 U. S. 59</a></p><p> defendant.  <em>See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#604">428 U. S. 604</a></span> (BURGER, C.J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <em>Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#420">435 U. S. 420</a></span> (BURGER, C.J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that, even if <em>Midcal</em> were applicable here, the rate bureaus would not be immune from federal antitrust liability.  According to that court, the actions of a private party cannot be attributed to a clearly articulated state policy, within the meaning of the <em>Midcal</em> test\'s first prong, "when it is left to the private party to carry out that policy or not as he sees fit."  702 F.2d at 539.  In the four States in which petitioners operate, all common carriers are free to submit proposals individually.  The court therefore reasoned that the States\' policies are neutral with respect to collective ratemaking, and that these policies will not be frustrated if the federal antitrust laws are construed to require individual submissions.</p>\n<p>In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals assumed that, if anticompetitive activity is not compelled, the State can have no interest in whether private parties engage in that conduct.  This type of analysis ignores the manner in which the States in this case clearly have intended their permissive policies to work.  Most common carriers probably will engage in collective ratemaking, as that will allow them to share the cost of preparing rate proposals.  If the joint rates are viewed as too high, however, carriers individually may submit lower proposed rates to the Commission in order to obtain a larger share of the market.  Thus, through the self-interested actions of private common carriers, the States may achieve the desired balance between the efficiency of collective ratemaking and the competition fostered by individual submissions.  Construing the Sherman Act to prohibit collective rate proposals eliminates the free choice necessary to ensure that these policies function in the manner intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="60">Page 471 U. S. 60</a></p><p> by the States.  The federal antitrust laws do not forbid the States to adopt policies that permit, but do not compel, anticompetitive conduct by <em>regulated</em> private parties.  As long as the State clearly articulates its intent to adopt a permissive policy, the first prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test is satisfied. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U. S. 773</a></span> (1975), this Court said that</p>\n<p>"[t]he threshold inquiry in determining if an anticompetitive activity is state action of the type the Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity is required by the State acting as sovereign."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#790">421 U.

On the basis of this citation, the Court of Appeals reasoned that <em>Midcal</em> did not eliminate the "compulsion requirement" of <em>Goldfarb.</em></p>\n<p><em>Goldfarb,</em> however, is not properly read as making compulsion a <em>sine qua non</em> to state action immunity.  In that case, the Virginia State Bar, a state agency, compelled Fairfax County lawyers to adhere to a minimum fee schedule.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#776">421 U. S. 776</a></span>-778.  The <em>Goldfarb</em> Court therefore was not concerned with the necessity of compulsion -- its presence in the case was not an issue.  The focal point of the <em>Goldfarb</em> opinion was the <em>source</em> of the anticompetitive policy, rather than whether the challenged conduct was <em>compelled.</em>  The Court held that a State Bar, <em>acting alone,</em> could not immunize its anticompetitive conduct.  Instead, the Court held that private parties were entitled to <em>Parker</em> immunity only if the State "acting as sovereign" intended to displace competition.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#790">421 U.

("<em>Goldfarb</em> . . . made it clear that, for purposes of the <em>Parker</em> doctrine, not every act of a state agency is that of the State as sovereign").</p>\n<p>Although <em>Goldfarb</em> did employ language of compulsion, it is beyond dispute that the Court would have reached the same result had it applied the two-pronged test later set forth in <em>Midcal.</em>  As stated above, Virginia, "as sovereign," did not have a "clearly articulated policy" designed to displace price competition among lawyers.  In fact, the Supreme Court of Virginia had explicitly directed lawyers not "to be controlled" by minimum fee schedules.  <em>Goldfarb, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#789">421 U. S. 789</a></span>, n.19.  Although we recognize that the language in <em>Goldfarb</em> is not without ambiguity, we do not read that opinion as making compulsion a prerequisite to a finding of state action immunity.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Parker</em> doctrine represents an attempt to resolve conflicts that may arise between principles of federalism and the goal of the antitrust laws, unfettered competition in the marketplace.  A compulsion requirement is inconsistent with both values.  It reduces the range of regulatory alternatives available to the State.  At the same time, insofar as it encourages States to require, rather than merely permit, anticompetitive conduct, a compulsion requirement may result in <em>greater</em> restraints on trade.  We do not believe that Congress intended to resolve conflicts between two competing interests by impairing both more than necessary.</p>\n<p>In summary, we hold <em>Midcal\'s</em> two-pronged test applicable to private parties\' claims of state action immunity.  Moreover, a state policy that expressly <em>permits,</em> but does not compel, anticompetitive conduct may be "clearly articulated" within the meaning of <em>Midcal.</em> [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Our holding today does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="62">Page 471 U. S. 62</a></p><p> suggest, however, that compulsion is irrelevant.  To the contrary, compulsion often is the best evidence that the State has a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy to displace competition.  <em>See Hallie v. Eau Claire, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/34/case.html#45">471 U. S. 45</a></span>-46; 1 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law \xef\xbf\xbd 212.5, p. 62 (Supp.1982) (compulsion is "powerful evidence" of existence of state policy).  Nevertheless, when other evidence conclusively shows that a State intends to adopt a permissive policy, the absence of compulsion should not prove fatal to a claim of <em>Parker</em> immunity.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Our holding that there is no inflexible "compulsion requirement" does not suggest necessarily that petitioners\' collective ratemaking activities are shielded from the federal antitrust laws.  A private party may claim state action immunity only if both prongs of the <em>Midcal</em> test are satisfied.  Here the Court of Appeals found, and the Government concedes, that the State Public Service Commissions actively supervise the collective ratemaking activities of the rate bureaus.  Therefore, the only issue left to resolve is whether the petitioners\' challenged conduct was taken pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy.</p>\n<p>The Public Service Commissions in North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee permit collective ratemaking.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em>  Acting alone, however, these agencies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 471 U. S. 63</a></p><p> could not immunize private anticompetitive conduct.  In <em>Goldfarb,</em> the State Bar -- a special type of "state agency" -- prohibited lawyers from charging fees lower than those set forth in schedules published by the local bar.  Nevertheless, this Court held that the local lawyers were not immune from antitrust liability, because their anticompetitive conduct was not required by the State as sovereign.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#790">421 U. S. 790</a></span>.  <em>Parker</em> immunity is available only when the challenged activity is undertaken pursuant to a clearly articulated policy of the State itself, such as a policy approved by a state legislature, <em>see New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/96/case.html">439 U. S. 96</a></span> (1978), or a <em>State Supreme Court, Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/350/case.html">433 U. S. 350</a></span> (1977).</p>\n<p>In this case, therefore, the petitioners are entitled to <em>Parker</em> immunity only if collective ratemaking is clearly sanctioned by the legislatures of the four States in which the rate bureaus operate.  North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee have statutes that explicitly permit collective ratemaking by common carriers. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The rate bureaus\' challenged actions, at least in these States, are taken pursuant to an express and clearly articulated state policy.  Mississippi\'s legislature, however, has not specifically addressed collective ratemaking.  We therefore must consider whether, in the absence of a statute expressly permitting the challenged conduct, the first prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test can be satisfied.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Mississippi Motor Carrier Regulatory Law of 1938, Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 77-7-1 <em>et seq.</em> (1972 and Supp.1984), gives the State Public Service Commission authority to regulate common carriers.  The statute provides that the Commission is to prescribe "just and reasonable" rates for the intrastate transportation of general commodities.  \xc2\xa7 77-7-221.  The legislature thus made clear its intent that intrastate rates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 471 U. S. 64</a></p><p> would be determined by a regulatory agency, rather than by the market.  The details of the inherently anticompetitive rate-setting process, however, are left to the agency\'s discretion.  The State Commission has exercised its discretion by actively encouraging collective ratemaking among common carriers.  <em>See</em> Response of the State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Service Comm\'n as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in District Court, No. 76-1909A (ND Ga.1977), p. 11.  We do not believe that the actions petitioners took pursuant to this regulatory program should be deprived of <em>Parker</em> immunity.</p>\n<p>A private party acting pursuant to an anticompetitive regulatory program need not "point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization" for its challenged conduct.  <em>Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#415">435 U. S. 415</a></span> (opinion of BRENNAN, J.).  As long as the State, as sovereign, clearly intends to displace competition in a particular field with a regulatory structure, the first prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test is satisfied.  In <em>Goldfarb,</em> the Court held that <em>Parker</em> immunity was unavailable only because the State, as sovereign, did not intend to do away with competition among lawyers.  421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#790">421 U. S. 790</a></span>.  Similarly, in <em>Cantor,</em> the anticompetitive acts of a private utility were held unprotected because the Michigan Legislature had indicated no intention to displace competition in the relevant market.  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#584">428 U. S. 584</a></span>-585.</p>\n<p>If more detail than a clear intent to displace competition were required of the legislature, States would find it difficult to implement through regulatory agencies their anticompetitive policies.  Agencies are created because they are able to deal with problems unforeseeable to, or outside the competence of, the legislature.  Requiring express authorization for every action that an agency might find necessary to effectuate state policy would diminish, if not destroy, its usefulness.  <em>Cf. Hallie v. Eau Claire, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/34/case.html#44">471 U. S. 44</a></span> (requiring explicit legislative authorization of anticompetitive activity would impose "detrimental side effects upon municipalities\' local autonomy").  Therefore, we hold </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 471 U. S. 65</a></p><p> that, if the State\'s intent to establish an anticompetitive regulatory program is clear, as it is in Mississippi, [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] the State\'s failure to describe the implementation of its policy in detail will not subject the program to the restraints of the federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>In summary, we hold that the petitioners\' collective ratemaking activity is immune from Sherman Act liability.  This anticompetitive conduct is taken pursuant to a "clearly articulated state policy."  The legislatures of North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee expressly permit motor common carriers to submit collective rate proposals to Public Service Commissions, which have the authority to accept, reject, or modify any recommendation.  Mississippi, the fourth State in which the petitioners operate, has not expressly approved of collective ratemaking, but it has articulated clearly its intent to displace price competition among common carriers with a regulatory structure.  Anticompetitive conduct taken pursuant to such a regulatory program satisfies the first </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 471 U. S. 66</a></p><p> prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test.  The second prong of the <em>Midcal</em> test likewise is met, for the Government has conceded that the relevant States, through their agencies, actively supervise the conduct of private parties.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>We conclude that the petitioners\' collective ratemaking activities, although not compelled by the States, are immune from antitrust liability under the doctrine of <em>Parker v.

This argument overlooks the fact that, with the exception of a questionable dictum in <em>Cantor, supra,</em> the dissent\'s proposed test has been used only in deciding whether Congress intended to immunize a federal regulatory program from the Sherman Act\'s proscriptions.  <em>See, e.g., Silver v.

These factors bear no discernible relationship to the prices that would be set by a perfectly efficient and unregulated market.  Therefore, the Mississippi statute clearly indicates that the legislature intended to displace competition in the intrastate trucking industry with a regulatory program.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE WHITE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The term "price-fixing" generally refers to a process by which competitors agree upon the prices that will prevail in the market for the goods or services they offer.  Such behavior is not essential to every public program for regulating industry.  In this case, for example, four Southern States have established programs for evaluating the reasonableness of rates that motor carriers propose to charge for intrastate transport, but the States do not require price-fixing by motor carriers.  They merely tolerate it.</p>\n<p>Reasoning deductively from a dictum in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

The result is inconsistent with the language [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] and policies of the Sherman Act, and this Court\'s precedent.  The Sherman Act only would interfere with the regulatory process if the States compelled price </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 471 U.

In that situation, the regulated carriers would face conflicting obligations under state and federal law, and the success of the States\' regulatory programs would be threatened.

State legislatures, whose powers are limited by the Supremacy Clause, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] may not expressly modify the obligations of any person under this federal law.  Only Congress, expressly or by implication, may authorize price-fixing, and has done so in particular industries or compelling circumstances.  Implied antitrust immunities, however, are disfavored [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and any exemptions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 471 U.

For many years prior to the enactment of the Sherman Act, state agencies regulated the business of insurance, but we rejected the view that these programs of public scrutiny supported "our reading into the Act an exemption" allowing insurance businesses to fix premium rates and agents\' commissions.  <em>United States v.

Thereafter, in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 33, Congress decided, as a matter of policy, that the Sherman Act\'s prohibition of price-fixing "shall [only] be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State Law."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1012(b).</p>\n<p>Consistent with its treatment of the insurance business in <em>South-Eastern Underwriters,</em> this Court has repeatedly held that collusive price-fixing by railroads is unlawful even though the end result is a reasonable charge approved by a public rate commission.

In the <em>Pennsylvania Railroad</em> case, the Court explained why this is so:</p>\n<p>"The fact that the rates which have been fixed may or may not be held unlawful by the [Interstate Commerce] Commission is immaterial to the issue before us. . . .  [E]ven a combination to fix reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates may be illegal.  <em>[Keogh v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern R.

The reason is that the Interstate Commerce Act does not provide remedies for the correction of all the abuses of ratemaking which might constitute violations of the anti-trust laws.  Thus a \'zone of reasonableness exists between maxima and minima within which a carrier is ordinarily free to adjust its charges for itself.\'  <em>United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. R.

Within that zone, the Commission lacks power to grant relief even though the rates are raised to the maxima by a conspiracy among carriers who employ </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 471 U.

S. 460</a></span>-461.  Collusive price-fixing by regulated carriers causes upward pressure on rates within the zone of reasonableness, and such combinations and conspiracies are generally actionable under the Sherman Act on the theory of the <em>Pennsylvania Railroad</em> case.</p>\n<p>Congress reacted to the <em>Pennsylvania Railroad</em> decision much as it reacted to the <em>South-Eastern Underwriters</em> decision.  It decided, as a matter of policy, that some price-fixing should be permitted in the transportation industry, and enacted the Reed-Bulwinkle Act of 1948 to effectuate that policy choice. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  In the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] however, Congress sharply curtailed the availability of this antitrust exemption.  Collective ratemaking is still permitted in limited circumstances, but rate bureaus must comply with strict procedural requirements.  <em>See</em> <l=|471 19|="" 48fn2="" u.s.="">n.19, <em>infra.</em></l=|471></p>\n<p>The defendants have stipulated that their price-fixing arrangements are identical to those followed by the Carrier Rate Committees in the Pennsylvania Railroad case which were declared unlawful under the Sherman Act.  <em>See</em> App. 40-41.  They also acknowledge that neither the Reed-Bulwinkle Act nor any other federal statute expressly exempts their price-fixing from the antitrust laws.  Nevertheless, they contend that Congress would not have intended to prohibit collective ratemaking by intrastate motor carriers when it is permitted, but not required, by state law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 471 U.

Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span> (1943).  This Court, however, has repeatedly recognized that private entities may not claim the state action immunity unless their unlawful conduct is compelled by the State.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Parker</em> case, this Court held that the Sherman Act does not reach "state action or official action directed by a state."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#351">317 U. S. 351</a></span>.  The case involved price-fixing that was mandated by a California statute in the furtherance of a price-support program for raisin farmers.  The Court held that the price-fixing was not prohibited by the Sherman Act:</p>\n<p>"[T]he prorate program here was never intended to operate by force of individual agreement or combination.  It derived its authority and its efficacy from the legislative command of the state, and was not intended to operate or become effective without that command.  We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#350">317 U.

Under <em>Parker,</em> private anticompetitive conduct must be "directed" by the State to be eligible for the state action immunity.</p>\n<p>In a later case involving price-fixing by attorneys through minimum fee schedules, the Court unanimously stated:</p>\n<p>"The threshold inquiry in determining if an anticompetitive activity is state action of the type the Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity is required by the State acting as sovereign.  <em>Parker v.

S. 579</a></span> (1976), the Court was also unanimous in its understanding that sovereign compulsion was a prerequisite for state action immunity. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  The opinion for the Court observed that it has long been settled "that state authorization, approval, encouragement, or participation in restrictive private conduct confers no antitrust immunity."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#592">428 U. S. 592</a></span>-593 (footnotes omitted). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The dissenting Justices agreed:  "private conduct, if it is to come within the state action exemption, must be not merely <em>prompted\' but `compelled\' by state action."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#637">428 U. S. 637</a></span> (Stewart, J., dissenting, joined by POWELL and REHNQUIST, JJ.).\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Cantor,</em> the Court only divided on the question whether the compulsion requirement alone was sufficient to confer antitrust immunity.  The dissent argued that Congress would not have intended to penalize Detroit Edison for engaging in a light bulb distribution program that had been approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission and that could not be discontinued without approval of the Commission.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#614">428 U. S. 614</a></span>-615.  The Court, on the other hand, acknowledged that continuation of the light bulb program was ostensibly required by the State, but went on to consider </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 471 U. S. 73</a></p><p> whether an antitrust exemption for this conduct was fundamental to the State\'s regulatory program.  Since Michigan\'s statutes only expressed an interest in regulating the electricity market, and not the light bulb market, the Court concluded that,</p>\n<p>"[r]egardless of the outcome of this case, Michigan\'s interest in regulating its utilities\' distribution of electricity will be almost entirely unimpaired."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/579/case.html#598">428 U. S. 598</a></span>.  Because the State had not articulated any intention to regulate the light bulb market, and the idea for the distribution program had come from the private utility, the State\'s requirement that the program continue was not sufficient to establish state action immunity from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s unanimous decision in <em>California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html">445 U. S. 97</a></span> (1980), signaled no departure from settled principles in this area.  In discussing the principles of law applicable to state action immunity, the Court quoted extensively from the language in <em>Parker</em> and <em>Goldfarb</em> [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] that recognized the compulsion requirement.  In any case, it was quite clear in <em>Midcal</em> that the California statutes required the unlawful resale price maintenance activities.  Thus, this Court had no occasion in that case to explore the contours of the compulsion requirement.  The references, in the <em>Midcal</em> opinion, to "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed" policies and "actively supervised" activities merely restated the standards to be applied in evaluating whether conduct ostensibly compelled by the State is entitled to the state action immunity.  These requirements limited the scope of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 471 U. S. 74</a></p><p> state action immunity for private entities; they did not expand the immunity to protect conduct that is merely prompted by the State. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Today the Court abandons the settled view that a private party is not entitled to state action immunity unless the State compelled him to act in violation of federal law.  Hereafter, a State may exempt price-fixing from the federal antitrust laws if it clearly articulates its intention to supplant competition with regulation in the relevant market, and if it actively supervises the unlawful conduct by evaluating the reasonableness of the prices charged.  The Court justifies this change in the law by finding it more consistent with "principles of federalism and the goal of the antitrust laws, unfettered competition in the marketplace."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/48/case.html#61">471 U. S. 61</a></span>.  I believe these conclusions are unsound.</p>\n<p><em>Deference to State Regulatory Programs</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s reliance today on vague "principles of federalism" obscures our traditional disfavor for implied exemptions to the Sherman Act.  We have only authorized exemptions from the Sherman Act for businesses regulated by federal law when "that exemption was necessary in order to make the regulatory Act work <em>and even then only to the minimum extent necessary.\'" [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  No lesser showing of repugnancy </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 471 U. S. 75</a></em></p><p><em> should be sufficient to justify an implied exemption based on a state regulatory program.\n</em></p>\n<p>Any other view separates the state action exemption from the reason for its existence.  The program involved in the <em>Parker</em> case was designed to enhance the market price of raisins by regulating both output and price. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  In other words, the state policy was one that replaced price competition with economic regulation.  Price support programs like the one involved in <em>Parker</em> cannot possibly succeed if every individual producer is free to participate or not participate in the program at his option.  In <em>Parker,</em> the challenged price-fixing was the heart of California\'s support program for agriculture; without immunity from the Sherman Act, the State would have had to abandon the project.</p>\n<p>In this case, the common denominator in the States\' regulatory programs for motor carriers is their reservation of the power to evaluate the reasonableness of proposed rates and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 471 U. S. 76</a></p><p> terms of carriage. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  In these programs,</p>\n<p>"no State requires that all rates among competing carriers for identical service be uniform, [and] no State requires, either by statute or regulation, or other express legislative or administrative mandate, that rates proposed by carriers be formulated by rate conferences."</p>\n<p>467 F.Supp. 471, 477 (ND Ga.1979).  When, as here, state regulatory policies are permissive, rather than mandatory, there is no necessary conflict between the antitrust laws and the regulatory systems; the regulated entity may comply with the edicts of each sovereign.  Indeed, it is almost meaningless to contemplate a "regulatory" policy that gives every regulated entity <em>carte blanche</em> to excuse itself from the consequences of the regulation.  Even a policy against speeding could not be enforced if every motorist could drive as fast as he chose.  When a State declares that a regulated entity need not follow a regulatory procedure, it as much as admits that this element is inconsequential to the ultimate success of the regulatory program. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 471 U. S. 77</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As I have noted, the Reed-Bulwinkle Act [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] authorizes collective ratemaking by interstate carriers under some circumstances.  The Court doubts whether "Congress intended to prevent the States from adopting virtually identical policies at the intrastate level."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/48/case.html#60">471 U. S. 60</a></span>, n. 22.  The Reed-Bulwinkle exemption, however, has been abolished for single-line rate requests, and to the extent that it still applies to general rate requests, the rate bureaus must follow stringent procedural safeguards which channel their conduct into useful informational tasks, and thereby diminish the threat of anticompetitive misconduct. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Even if there were sound policy reasons [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] for extending the Reed-Bulwinkle exemption, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 471 U.

Trans-Missouri Freight Assn.,</em> 166 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/166/290/case.html#340">166 U. S. 340</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>The Policy of Competition</em></p>\n<p>The Court embraces the defendants\' specious argument that</p>\n<p>"insofar as it encourages States to require, rather than merely permit, anticompetitive conduct, a compulsion requirement may result in <em>greater</em> restraints on trade."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/48/case.html#61">471 U. S. 61</a></span>.  The Court finds this "result" inconsistent with the policies of the Sherman Act.  This argument is seriously flawed.</p>\n<p>On a practical level, the Court\'s argument assumes that a decision for the Government today would cause the States to rush into enactment legislation compelling price-fixing in the motor carrier industry.  Moreover, the Court\'s argument assumes that a Congress that only recently has acted to increase competition in the interstate motor carrier field would remain silent in the face of anticompetitive legislation at the intrastate level.  These assumptions are wholly speculative.</p>\n<p>On a more theoretical level, the Court ignores the anticompetitive effect of the collective ratemaking practices challenged in this litigation. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  The Court of Appeals correctly observed that</p>\n<p>"[c]ollective [rate] formulation clearly tampers with the price structure for intrastate commodities; the rate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 471 U. S. 79</a></p><p> bureau arrangement substitutes concerted pricing decisions among competing carriers for the influence of impersonal market forces on proposed rates."</p>\n<p>672 F.2d 469, 478 (CA5, Unit B, now CA11, 1982).  The increased rates for transportation caused by this behavior are especially grave in a basic industry, like transportation, where the ripple effects of the increased rates are magnified as raw materials, semifinished and finished goods are transported at various stages of production and distribution.</p>\n<p>Active supervision of the rate bureau process -- like that provided in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 -- might minimize the anticompetitive effects of collective ratemaking.  To the extent that the State Regulatory Commissions are structured like the ICC in the <em>Pennsylvania Railroad</em> case, however, they only have the power to reject the rates proposed by the carriers if those rates fall outside the "zone of reasonableness."  Unless the Commissions "actively supervise" the price-fixing process itself, they cannot eliminate the upward pressure on rates caused by collusive ratemaking. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Unfortunately, the nature of the "active supervision" of those carriers who take part in collective ratemaking is not fully disclosed by the record.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly applied established precedent in holding that the Government is entitled </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 471 U. S. 80</a></p><p> to an injunction against the defendants\' price-fixing.  Such price-fixing is unlawful unless it is expressly authorized by statute, or required by a State\'s regulatory program.  Today the Court authorizes collective ratemaking by intrastate motor carriers even though the State has only permitted it in a program regulating the reasonableness of prices in the industry.  Immunity of this type was rejected by the Court in the <em>South-Eastern Underwriters</em> and <em>Pennsylvania Railroad</em> cases, but today, under the shroud of the state action doctrine, [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>] it is resurrected.</p>\n<p><em>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, public agencies like municipalities need only establish that their anticompetitive conduct is taken pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.  <em>Hallie v.
