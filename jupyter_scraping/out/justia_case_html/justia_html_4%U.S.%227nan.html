Rep. 99. 12 Mod. 457. 1 Pow. Cont. 344. </p><p> The defendant\'s counsel (Dallas) contended, that whatever might be the impressions, or inferences, of the referees, the declaration of M\'Lure did not, in itself, amount to an express assumpsit; that it was not a case, in which an implied assumpsit could be raised; that, at most, it was a mere gratuitous undertaking without any possible consideration, beneficial to M\'Lure; a nudum pactum, on which no action could be maintained; and that the consideration was not proved by the evidence, as it was laid in the declaration. 2 Bl.

E. 79. 2 Burr. 1671. </p><p></p><p> THE COURT. </p><p> The COURT delivered a charge to the jury, in which they stated, that the smallest spark of benefit, or accommodation, was sufficient to create a valid consideration for a promise; and intimated that their opinion was decidedly in favour of the plaintiff. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p></p><p> Verdict, accordingly, for the plaintiff. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> BRACKENRIDGE, Justice, seemed to dissent from the opinion ? ? the Court, with this remark: \'The English books say, that there must be a spark of consideration (though a single spark is enough) to maintain an action upon a promise: but, in this case, the Court have blown out the spark; and I cannot perceive, whence they get light sufficient to enable them to decide for the plaintiff.\' </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
