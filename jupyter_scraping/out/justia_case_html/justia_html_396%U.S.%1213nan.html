JUSTICE HARLAN, Circuit Justice.</p>\n<p>While I am of the view that this case is not unlikely to be found a worthy candidate for certiorari, I am also of the opinion that the present application for an interim stay and other relief should be passed along to the full Court for consideration.</p>\n<p>The latter conclusion follows from my belief that the factors involved in determining whether a stay should issue are such as to call for the collective judgment of the members of the Court, and not merely that of an individual Justice; from the circumstance that the Court itself has already denied a similar stay application, albeit at a stage when the case was in a different posture, and from the fact that an individual Justice has no power to order an accelerated schedule for briefing and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1214">Page 396 U.

At that time, I shall, pursuant to Rule 50(6), refer this application to the Court for simultaneous consideration and action.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
