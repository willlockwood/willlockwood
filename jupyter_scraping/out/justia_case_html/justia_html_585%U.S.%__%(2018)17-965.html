The Proclamation placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate.  Foreign states were selected for inclusion based on a review undertaken pursuant to one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s earlier Executive Orders.  As part of that review, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department and intelligence agencies, developed an information and risk assessment \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline.\xe2\x80\x9d  DHS then collected and evaluated data for all foreign governments, identifying those having deficient information-sharing practices and presenting national security concerns, as well as other countries \xe2\x80\x9cat risk\xe2\x80\x9d of failing to meet the baseline.  After a 50-day period during which the State Department made diplomatic efforts to encourage foreign governments to improve their practices, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security concluded that eight countries\xe2\x80\x94Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen\xe2\x80\x94remained deficient.  She recommended entry restrictions for certain nationals from all of those countries but Iraq, which had a close cooperative relationship with the U.\xc2\xa0S.  She also recommended including Somalia, which met the information-sharing component of the baseline standards but had other special risk factors, such as a significant terrorist presence.  After consulting with multiple Cabinet members, the President adopted the recommendations and issued the Proclamation.  Invoking his authority under 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(f) and 1185(a), he determined that certain restrictions were necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent the entry of those foreign nationals about whom the United \xc2\xa0States Government lacks sufficient information\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9celicit improved identity-management and information-sharing protocols and practices from foreign governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Proclamation imposes a range of entry restrictions that vary based on the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d in each of the eight countries.  It exempts lawful permanent residents and provides case-by-case waivers under certain circumstances.  It also directs DHS to assess on a continuing basis whether the restrictions should be modified or continued, and to report to the President every 180 days.  At the completion of the first such review period, the President determined that Chad had sufficiently improved its practices, and he accordingly lifted restrictions on its nationals.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94the State of Hawaii, three individuals with foreign relatives affected by the entry suspension, and the Muslim Association of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x94argue that the Proclamation violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Establishment Clause.  The District Court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the restrictions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Proclamation contravened two provisions of the INA: \xc2\xa71182(f), which authorizes the President to \xe2\x80\x9csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d whenever he \xe2\x80\x9cfinds\xe2\x80\x9d that their entry \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno person shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\xe2\x80\x99s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court did not reach the Establishment Clause claim.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0This Court assumes without deciding that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 statutory claims are reviewable, notwithstanding consular nonreviewability or any other statutory nonreviewability issue.  See <i>Sale</i> v. <i>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The President has lawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him under \xc2\xa71182(f) to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0By its terms, \xc2\xa71182(f) exudes deference to the President in every clause.  It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions.  It thus vests the President with \xe2\x80\x9cample power\xe2\x80\x9d to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the INA.  <i>Sale</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187.  The Proclamation falls well within this comprehensive delegation.  The sole prerequisite set forth in \xc2\xa71182(f) is that the President \xe2\x80\x9cfind[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d that the entry of the covered aliens \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.  He first ordered DHS and other agencies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of every single country\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the information and risk assessment baseline.  He then issued a Proclamation with extensive findings about the deficiencies and their impact.  Based on that review, he found that restricting entry of aliens who could not be vetted with adequate information was in the national interest.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Even assuming that some form of inquiry into the persuasiveness of the President\xe2\x80\x99s findings is appropriate, but see <i>Webster </i>v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592, 600, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attacks on the sufficiency of the findings cannot be sustained.  The 12-page Proclamation is more detailed than any prior order issued under \xc2\xa71182(f).  And such a searching inquiry is inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded the President in this sphere.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Sale</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187\xe2\x80\x93188.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Proclamation comports with the remaining textual limits in \xc2\xa71182(f).  While the word \xe2\x80\x9csuspend\xe2\x80\x9d often connotes a temporary deferral, the President is not required to prescribe in advance a fixed end date for the entry restriction.  Like its predecessors, the Proclamation makes clear that its \xe2\x80\x9cconditional restrictions\xe2\x80\x9d will remain in force only so long as necessary to \xe2\x80\x9caddress\xe2\x80\x9d the identified \xe2\x80\x9cinadequacies and risks\xe2\x80\x9d within the covered nations.  Finally, the Proclamation properly identifies a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d whose entry is suspended, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d comfortably encompasses a group of people linked by nationality.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs have not identified any conflict between the Proclamation and the immigration scheme reflected in the INA that would implicitly bar the President from addressing deficiencies in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s vetting system.  The existing grounds of inadmissibility and the narrow Visa Waiver Program do not address the failure of certain high-risk countries to provide a minimum baseline of reliable information.  Further, neither the legislative history of \xc2\xa71182(f) nor historical practice justifies departing from the clear text of the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the President\xe2\x80\x99s entry suspension violates \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) ignores the basic distinction between admissibility determinations and visa issuance that runs throughout the INA.  Section 1182 defines the universe of aliens who are admissible into the United States (and therefore eligible to receive a visa).  Once \xc2\xa71182 sets the boundaries of admissibility, \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) prohibits discrimination in the allocation of immigrant visas based on nationality and other traits.  Had Congress intended in \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) to constrain the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to determine who may enter the country, it could have chosen language directed to that end.  Common sense and historical practice confirm that \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) does not limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegated authority under \xc2\xa71182(f).  Presidents have repeatedly exercised their authority to suspend entry on the basis of nationality.  And on plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading, the President would not be permitted to suspend entry from particular foreign states in response to an epidemic, or even if the United States were on the brink of war.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">3.\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The individual plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the exclusion of their relatives under the Establishment Clause.  A person\xe2\x80\x99s interest in being united with his relatives is sufficiently concrete and particularized to form the basis of an Article III injury in fact.  Cf., <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Kerry</i> v. <i>Din</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9326. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs allege that the primary purpose of the Proclamation was religious animus and that the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated concerns about vetting protocols and national security were but pretexts for discriminating against Muslims.  At the heart of their case is a series of statements by the President and his advisers both during the campaign and since the President assumed office.  The issue, however, is not whether to denounce the President\xe2\x80\x99s statements, but the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.  In doing so, the Court must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s political departments largely immune from judicial control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fiallo</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787, 792.  Although foreign nationals seeking admission have no constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.  That review is limited to whether the Executive gives a \xe2\x80\x9cfacially legitimate and bona fide\xe2\x80\x9d reason for its action, <i>Kleindienst</i> v. <i>Mandel</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753, 769, but the Court need not define the precise contours of that narrow inquiry in this case.  For today\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, the Court assumes that it may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying rational basis review, <i>i.e., </i>whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 extrinsic evidence may be considered, but the policy will be upheld so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0On the few occasions where the Court has struck down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny, a common thread has been that the laws at issue were \xe2\x80\x9cdivorced from any factual context from which [the Court] could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests<i>.\xe2\x80\x9d</i> <i>Romer </i>v<i>.</i> <i>Evans</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 620, 635.  The Proclamation does not fit that pattern.  It is expressly premised on legitimate purposes and says nothing about religion.  The entry restrictions on Muslim-majority nations are limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.  Moreover, the Proclamation reflects the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their agencies.  Plaintiffs challenge the entry suspension based on their perception of its effectiveness and wisdom, but the Court cannot substitute its own assessment for the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s predictive judgments on such matters.  See <i>Holder </i>v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 33\xe2\x80\x9334. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Three additional features of the entry policy support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim of a legitimate national security interest.  First, since the President introduced entry restrictions in January 2017, three Muslim-majority countries\xe2\x80\x94Iraq, Sudan, and Chad\xe2\x80\x94have been removed from the list.  Second, for those countries still subject to entry restrictions, the Proclamation includes numerous exceptions for various categories of foreign nationals.  Finally, the Proclamation creates a waiver program open to all covered foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants.  Under these circumstances, the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review.

The Act also vests the President with authority to restrict the entry of aliens when- ever he finds that their entry \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(f).  Relying on that delegation, the President concluded that it was necessary to impose entry restrictions on nationals of countries that do not share adequate information for an informed entry determination, or that otherwise present national security risks.  Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017) (Proclamation).  The plaintiffs in this litigation, respondents here, challenged the application of those entry restrictions to certain aliens abroad.  We now decide whether the President had authority under the Act to issue the Proclamation, and whether the entry policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.  82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (2017) (EO\xe2\x80\x931).  EO\xe2\x80\x931 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review to examine the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments about their nationals seeking to enter the United States.  \xc2\xa73(a).  Pending that review, the order suspended for 90 days the entry of foreign nationals from seven countries\xe2\x80\x94Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen\xe2\x80\x94that had been previously identified by Congress or prior administrations as posing heightened terrorism risks.  \xc2\xa73(c).  The District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a temporary restraining order blocking the entry restrictions, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request to stay that order.  <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Trump</i>, 847 F.\xc2\xa03d 1151 (2017) (<i>per curiam</i>).</p><p>In response, the President revoked EO\xe2\x80\x931, replacing it with Executive Order No. 13780, which again directed a worldwide review.  82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (2017) (EO\xe2\x80\x932).  Citing investigative burdens on agencies and the need to diminish the risk that dangerous individuals would enter without adequate vetting, EO\xe2\x80\x932 also temporarily restricted the entry (with case-by-case waivers) of foreign nationals from six of the countries covered by EO\xe2\x80\x931: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(c), 3(a).  The order explained that those countries had been selected because each \xe2\x80\x9cis a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(d).  The entry restriction was to stay in effect for 90 days, pending completion of the worldwide review.</p><p>These interim measures were immediately challenged in court.  The District Courts for the Districts of Maryland and Hawaii entered nationwide preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the entry suspension, and the respective Courts of Appeals upheld those injunctions, albeit on different grounds.  <i>International Refugee Assistance Project</i> (<i>IRAP</i>) v. <i>Trump</i>, 857 F.\xc2\xa03d 554 (CA4 2017); <i>Hawaii</i> v. <i>Trump</i>, 859 F.\xc2\xa03d 741 (CA9 2017) (<i>per curiam</i>).  This Court granted certiorari and stayed the injunctions\xe2\x80\x94allowing the entry suspension to go into effect\xe2\x80\x94with respect to foreign nationals who lacked a \xe2\x80\x9ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with a person or entity in the United States.  <i>Trump</i> v. <i>IRAP</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 12).

Reg. 45161.  The Proclamation (as its title indicates) sought to improve vetting procedures by identifying ongoing deficiencies in the information needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries present \xe2\x80\x9cpublic safety threats.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(a).  To further that purpose, the Proclamation placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate.</p><p>The Proclamation described how foreign states were selected for inclusion based on the review undertaken pursuant to EO\xe2\x80\x932.  As part of that review, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department and several intelligence agencies,  developed a \xe2\x80\x9cbaseline\xe2\x80\x9d for the information required from foreign governments to confirm the identity of individuals seeking entry into the United States, and to determine whether those individuals pose a security threat.  \xc2\xa71(c).  The baseline included three components.  The first,  \xe2\x80\x9cidentity-management information,\xe2\x80\x9d focused on whether a foreign government ensures the integrity of travel documents by issuing electronic passports, reporting lost or stolen passports, and making available additional identity-related information.  Second, the agencies considered the extent to which the country discloses information on criminal history and suspected terrorist links, provides travel document exemplars, and facilitates the U.\xc2\xa0S. Government\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of information about airline passengers and crews traveling to the United States.  Finally, the agencies weighed various indicators of national security risk,  including whether the foreign state is a known or potential terrorist safe haven and whether it regularly declines to receive returning nationals following final orders of  removal from the United States.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>DHS collected and evaluated data regarding all foreign governments.  \xc2\xa71(d).  It identified 16 countries as having deficient information-sharing practices and presenting national security concerns, and another 31 countries as \xe2\x80\x9cat risk\xe2\x80\x9d of similarly failing to meet the baseline.  \xc2\xa71(e).  The State Department then undertook diplomatic efforts over a 50-day period to encourage all foreign governments to improve their practices.  \xc2\xa71(f\xc2\xa0).  As a result of that effort, numerous countries provided DHS with travel document exemplars and agreed to share information on known or suspected terrorists.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Following the 50-day period, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security concluded that eight countries\xe2\x80\x94Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen\xe2\x80\x94remained deficient in terms of their risk profile and willingness to provide requested information.  The Acting Secretary recommended that the President impose entry restrictions on certain nationals from all of those countries except Iraq.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71(g), (h).  She also concluded that although Somalia generally satisfied the information-sharing component of the baseline standards, its \xe2\x80\x9cidentity-management deficiencies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csignificant terrorist presence\xe2\x80\x9d presented special circumstances justifying additional limitations.  She therefore recommended entry limitations for certain nationals of that country.  \xc2\xa71(i).  As for Iraq, the Acting Secretary found that entry limitations on its nationals were not warranted given the close cooperative relationship between the U.\xc2\xa0S. and Iraqi Governments and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to combating ISIS.  \xc2\xa71(g).</p><p>After consulting with multiple Cabinet members and other officials, the President adopted the Acting Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and issued the Proclamation.  Invoking his authority under 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) and 1185(a), the President determined that certain entry restrictions were necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent the entry of those foreign nationals about whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9celicit improved identity- management and information-sharing protocols and  practices from foreign governments\xe2\x80\x9d; and otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cadvance [the] foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States.

The President explained that these restrictions would be the \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely to encourage cooperation\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] the United States until such time as improvements occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The Proclamation imposed a range of restrictions that vary based on the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d in each of the eight countries.  <i>Ibid.</i>  For countries that do not cooperate with the United States in identifying security risks (Iran, North Korea, and Syria), the Proclamation suspends entry of all nationals, except for Iranians seeking nonimmigrant student and exchange-visitor visas.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(b)(ii), (d)(ii), (e)(ii).  For countries that have information-sharing deficiencies but are nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable counterterrorism partner[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (Chad, Libya, and Yemen), it restricts entry of nationals seeking immigrant visas and nonimmigrant business or tourist visas.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(a)(i), (c)(i), (g)(i).  Because Somalia generally satisfies the baseline standards but was found to present special risk factors, the Proclamation suspends entry of nationals seeking immigrant visas and requires additional scrutiny of nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas.  \xc2\xa72(h)(ii).  And for Venezuela, which refuses to cooperate in information sharing but for which alternative means are available to identify its nationals, the Proclamation limits entry only of certain government officials and their family members on nonimmigrant business or tourist visas.  \xc2\xa72(f\xc2\xa0)(ii).</p><p>The Proclamation exempts lawful permanent residents and foreign nationals who have been granted asylum.  \xc2\xa73(b).  It also provides for case-by-case waivers when a foreign national demonstrates undue hardship, and that his entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to public safety.  \xc2\xa73(c)(i); see also \xc2\xa73(c)(iv) (listing examples of when a waiver might be appropriate, such as if the foreign national seeks to reside with a close family member, obtain urgent medical care, or pursue significant business obligations).  The Proclamation further directs DHS to assess on a continuing basis whether entry restrictions should be modified or continued, and to report to the President every 180 days.  \xc2\xa74.  Upon completion of the first such review period, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary of Homeland Security, determined that Chad had sufficiently improved its practices, and he accordingly lifted restrictions on its nationals.  Presidential Proclamation No. 9723, 83 Fed. Reg. 15937 (2018).</p><p>B</p><p>Plaintiffs in this case are the State of Hawaii, three individuals (Dr. Ismail Elshikh, John Doe #1, and John Doe #2), and the Muslim Association of Hawaii.  The State operates the University of Hawaii system, which recruits students and faculty from the designated countries.  The three individual plaintiffs are U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who have relatives from Iran, Syria, and Yemen applying for immigrant or nonimmigrant visas.  The Association is a nonprofit organization that operates a mosque in Hawaii.</p><p>Plaintiffs challenged the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x94except as  applied to North Korea and Venezuela\xe2\x80\x94on several grounds.  As relevant here, they argued that the Proclamation contravenes provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),66Stat.187, as amended.  Plaintiffs further claimed that the Proclamation violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it was motivated not by concerns pertaining to national security but by animus toward Islam.</p><p>The District Court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the entry restrictions.  The court concluded that the Proclamation violated two provisions of the INA: \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0), because the President did not make sufficient findings that the entry of the covered foreign nationals would be detrimental to the national interest, and \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A), because the policy discriminates against immigrant visa applicants on the basis of nationality.  265 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 1140, 1155\xe2\x80\x931159 (Haw. 2017).  The Government requested expedited briefing and sought a stay pending appeal.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a partial stay, permitting enforcement of the Proclamation with respect to foreign nationals who lack a bona fide relationship with the United States.  This Court then stayed the injunction in full pending disposition of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed.  The court first held that the Proclamation exceeds the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  In its view, that provision authorizes only a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary\xe2\x80\x9d suspension of entry in response to \xe2\x80\x9cexigencies\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would be ill-equipped to address.\xe2\x80\x9d  878 F.\xc2\xa03d 662, 684, 688 (2017).  The court further reasoned that the Proclamation \xe2\x80\x9cconflicts with the INA\xe2\x80\x99s finely reticulated regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d by addressing \xe2\x80\x9cmatters of immigration already passed upon by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 685, 690.  The Ninth Circuit then turned to \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) and determined that the entry restrictions also contravene the prohibition on nationality-based discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas.  The court did not reach plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Establishment Clause claim.</p><p>We granted certiorari.  583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018).</p><p>II</p><p>Before addressing the merits of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 statutory claims, we consider whether we have authority to do so.  The Government argues that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the Proclamation under the INA is not justiciable.  Relying on the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, the Government contends that because aliens have no \xe2\x80\x9cclaim of right\xe2\x80\x9d to enter the United States, and because exclusion of aliens is \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental act of sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d by the political branches, review of an exclusion decision \xe2\x80\x9cis not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States ex rel. Knauff</i> v. <i>Shaughnessy</i>,338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 537, 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (1950).  According to the Government, that principle barring review is reflected in the INA, which sets forth a comprehensive framework for review of orders of removal, but authorizes judicial review only for aliens physically present in the United States.  See Brief for Petitioners 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (citing8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252).</p><p>The justiciability of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge under the INA presents a difficult question.  The Government made similar arguments that no judicial review was available in <i>Sale</i> v. <i>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</i>,509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155 (1993).  The Court in that case, however, went on to consider on the merits a statutory claim like the one before us without addressing the issue of reviewability.  The Government does not argue that the doctrine of consular nonreview- ability goes to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 13, nor does it point to any provision of the INA that  expressly strips the Court of jurisdiction over plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims, see <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145, 153 (2013) (requiring Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cclearly state[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d that a statutory provision is jurisdictional).  As a result, we may assume without deciding that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 statutory claims are reviewable, notwithstanding consular nonreviewability or any other statutory nonreviewability issue, and we proceed on that basis.</p><p>III</p><p>The INA establishes numerous grounds on which an alien abroad may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for a visa.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(1) (health-related grounds), (a)(2) (criminal history), (a)(3)(B) (terrorist activities), (a)(3)(C) (foreign policy grounds).  Congress has also delegated to the President authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens in certain circumstances.  The principal source of that authority, \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0), enables the President to \xe2\x80\x9csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d whenever he \xe2\x80\x9cfinds\xe2\x80\x9d that their entry \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>Plaintiffs argue that the Proclamation is not a valid exercise of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority under the INA.  In their view, \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) confers only a residual power to temporarily halt the entry of a discrete group of aliens engaged in harmful conduct.  They also assert that the Proclamation violates another provision of the INA\xe2\x80\x948 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94because it discriminates on the basis of nationality in the issuance of immigrant visas.</p><p>By its plain language, \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) grants the President broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States.  The President lawfully exercised that discretion based on his findings\xe2\x80\x94following a worldwide, multi-agency review\xe2\x80\x94that entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the national interest.  And plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to identify a conflict with other provisions in the INA, and their appeal to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes and legislative history, fail to overcome the clear statutory language.</p><p>A</p><p>The text of \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) states:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>By its terms, \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) exudes deference to the President in every clause.  It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry (\xe2\x80\x9c[w]henever [he] finds that the entry\xe2\x80\x9d of aliens \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental\xe2\x80\x9d to the national interest); whose entry to suspend (\xe2\x80\x9call aliens or any class of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d); for how long (\xe2\x80\x9cfor such period as he shall deem necessary\xe2\x80\x9d); and on what conditions (\xe2\x80\x9cany restrictions he may deem to be appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is therefore unsurprising that we have previously observed that \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) vests the President with \xe2\x80\x9cample power\xe2\x80\x9d to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the INA.  <i>Sale</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187 (finding it \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly clear\xe2\x80\x9d that the President could \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a naval blockade\xe2\x80\x9d to prevent illegal migrants from entering the United States); see also <i>Abourezk</i> v. <i>Reagan</i>, 785 F.\xc2\xa02d 1043, 1049, n. 2 (CADC 1986) (describing the \xe2\x80\x9csweeping proclamation power\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) as enabling the President to supplement the other grounds of inadmissibility in the INA).</p><p>The Proclamation falls well within this comprehensive delegation.  The sole prerequisite set forth in \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) is that the President \xe2\x80\x9cfind[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d that the entry of the covered aliens \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.  He first ordered DHS and other agencies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of every single country\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the information and risk assessment baseline.  The President then issued a Proclamation setting forth extensive findings describing how deficiencies in the practices of select foreign governments\xe2\x80\x94several of which are state sponsors of terrorism\xe2\x80\x94deprive the Government of \xe2\x80\x9csufficient information to assess the risks [those countries\xe2\x80\x99 nationals] pose to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Proclamation \xc2\xa71(h)(i).  Based on that review, the President found that it was in the national interest to restrict entry of aliens who could not be vetted with adequate information\xe2\x80\x94both to protect national security and public safety, and to induce improvement by their home countries.  The Proclamation therefore \xe2\x80\x9ccraft[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. country-specific restrictions that would be most likely to encourage cooperation given each country\xe2\x80\x99s distinct circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d while securing the Nation \xe2\x80\x9cuntil such time as improvements occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>Plaintiffs believe that these findings are insufficient.  They argue, as an initial matter, that the Proclamation fails to provide a persuasive rationale for why nationality alone renders the covered foreign nationals a security risk.  And they further discount the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated concern about deficient vetting because the Proclamation allows many aliens from the designated countries to enter on nonimmigrant visas.</p><p>Such arguments are grounded on the premise that \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) not only requires the President to <i>make</i> a finding that entry \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d but also to explain that finding with sufficient detail to enable judicial review.  That premise is questionable.  See <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Doe</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592, 600 (1988) (concluding that a statute authorizing the CIA Director to terminate an employee when the Director \xe2\x80\x9cshall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d forecloses \xe2\x80\x9cany meaningful judicial standard of review\xe2\x80\x9d).  But even assuming that some form of review is appropriate, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attacks on the sufficiency of the President\xe2\x80\x99s findings cannot be sustained.  The 12-page Proclamation\xe2\x80\x94which thoroughly describes the process, agency evaluations, and recommendations underlying the President\xe2\x80\x99s chosen restrictions\xe2\x80\x94is more detailed than any prior order a President has issued under \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  Contrast Presidential Proclamation No. 6958, 3 CFR 133 (1996) (President Clinton) (explaining in one sentence why suspending entry of members of the Sudanese government and armed forces \xe2\x80\x9cis in the foreign policy interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 4865, 3 CFR 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (1981) (President Reagan) (explaining in five sentences why measures to curtail \xe2\x80\x9cthe continuing illegal migration by sea of large numbers of undocumented aliens into the southeastern United States\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Moreover, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 request for a searching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the President\xe2\x80\x99s justifications is inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded the President in this sphere.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the President\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method\xe2\x80\x9d of addressing perceived risks is justified from a policy perspective is \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant to the scope of his [\xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0)] authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sale</i>, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187\xe2\x80\x93188.  And when the President adopts \xe2\x80\x9ca preventive measure .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the context of international affairs and national security,\xe2\x80\x9d he is \xe2\x80\x9cnot required to conclusively link all of the pieces in the puzzle before [courts] grant weight to [his] empirical conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holder</i> v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 35 (2010).</p><p>The Proclamation also comports with the remaining textual limits in \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  We agree with plaintiffs that the word \xe2\x80\x9csuspend\xe2\x80\x9d often connotes a \xe2\x80\x9cdefer[ral] till later,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2303 (1966).  But that does not mean that the President is required to prescribe in advance a fixed end date for the entry restrictions.  Section 1182(f\xc2\xa0) authorizes the President to suspend entry \xe2\x80\x9cfor such period as he shall deem necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  It follows that when a President suspends entry in response to a diplomatic dispute or policy concern, he may link the duration of those restrictions, implicitly or explicitly, to the resolution of the triggering condition.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Presidential Proclamation No. 5829, 3 CFR 88 (1988) (President Reagan) (suspending the entry of certain Panamanian nationals \xe2\x80\x9cuntil such time as .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. democracy has been restored in Panama\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 8693, 3 CFR 86\xe2\x80\x9387 (2011) (President Obama) (suspending the entry of individuals subject to a travel restriction under United Nations Security Council resolutions \xe2\x80\x9cuntil such time as the Secretary of State determines that [the suspension] is no longer necessary\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, not one of the 43 suspension orders issued prior to this litigation has specified a precise end date.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the Proclamation makes clear that its \xe2\x80\x9cconditional restrictions\xe2\x80\x9d will remain in force only so long as necessary to \xe2\x80\x9caddress\xe2\x80\x9d the identified \xe2\x80\x9cinadequacies and risks\xe2\x80\x9d within the covered nations.  Proclamation Preamble, and \xc2\xa71(h); see <i>ibid. </i>(explaining that the aim is to \xe2\x80\x9crelax[\xc2\xa0] or remove[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d the entry restrictions \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as possible\xe2\x80\x9d).  To that end, the Proclamation establishes an ongoing process to engage covered nations and assess every 180 days whether the entry restrictions should be modified or terminated.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a), (b).  Indeed, after the initial review period, the President determined that Chad had made sufficient improvements to its identity-management protocols, and he accordingly lifted the entry suspension on its nationals.  See Proclamation No. 9723, 83 Fed. Reg. 15937.</p><p>Finally, the Proclamation properly identifies a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nationals of select countries\xe2\x80\x94whose entry is suspended.  Plaintiffs argue that \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to a well-defined group of individuals who share a common \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic\xe2\x80\x9d apart from nationality.  Brief for Respondents 42.  But the text of \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0), of course, does not say that, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d comfortably encompasses a group of people linked by nationality.  Plaintiffs also contend that the class cannot be \xe2\x80\x9coverbroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 42.  But that simply amounts to an unspoken tailoring requirement found nowhere in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s grant of authority to suspend entry of not only \xe2\x80\x9cany class of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9call aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>In short, the language of \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) is clear, and the Proclamation does not exceed any textual limit on the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p><p>B</p><p>Confronted with this \xe2\x80\x9cfacially broad grant of power,\xe2\x80\x9d 878 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 688, plaintiffs focus their attention on statutory structure and legislative purpose.  They seek support in, first, the immigration scheme reflected in the INA as a whole, and, second, the legislative history of \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) and historical practice.  Neither argument justifies departing from the clear text of the statute.</p><p>1</p><p>Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 structural argument starts with the premise that \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) does not give the President authority to countermand Congress\xe2\x80\x99s considered policy judgments.  The President, they say, may supplement the INA, but he cannot supplant it.  And in their view, the Proclamation falls in the latter category because Congress has already specified a two-part solution to the problem of aliens seeking entry from countries that do not share sufficient information with the United States.  First, Congress designed an individualized vetting system that places the burden on the alien to prove his admissibility.  See \xc2\xa71361.  Second, instead of banning the entry of nationals from particular countries, Congress sought to encourage information sharing through a Visa Waiver Program offering fast-track admission for countries that cooperate with the United States.  See \xc2\xa71187.</p><p>We may assume that \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) does not allow the President to expressly override particular provisions of the INA.  But plaintiffs have not identified any conflict between the statute and the Proclamation that would implicitly bar the President from addressing deficiencies in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s vetting system.</p><p>To the contrary, the Proclamation supports Congress\xe2\x80\x99s individualized approach for determining admissibility.  The INA sets forth various inadmissibility grounds based on connections to terrorism and criminal history, but those provisions can only work when the consular officer has sufficient (and sufficiently reliable) information to make that determination.  The Proclamation promotes the effectiveness of the vetting process by helping to ensure the availability of such information.</p><p>Plaintiffs suggest that the entry restrictions are unnecessary because consular officers can simply deny visas in individual cases when an alien fails to carry his burden of proving admissibility\xe2\x80\x94for example, by failing to produce certified records regarding his criminal history.  Brief for Respondents 48.  But that misses the point: A critical finding of the Proclamation is that the failure of certain countries to provide reliable information prevents the Government from accurately determining whether an alien is inadmissible or poses a threat.  Proclamation \xc2\xa71(h).  Unless consular officers are expected to apply categorical rules and deny entry from those countries across the board, fraudulent or unreliable documentation may thwart their review in individual cases.  And at any rate, the INA certainly does not <i>require</i> that systemic problems such as the lack of reliable information be addressed only in a progression of case-by-case admissibility determinations.  One of the key objectives of the Proclamation is to encourage foreign governments to improve their practices, thus facilitating the Government\xe2\x80\x99s vetting process overall.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Nor is there a conflict between the Proclamation and the Visa Waiver Program.  The Program allows travel without a visa for short-term visitors from 38 countries that have entered into a \xe2\x80\x9crigorous security partnership\xe2\x80\x9d with the United States.  DHS, U.\xc2\xa0S. Visa Waiver Program (Apr. 6, 2016), http://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program (as last visited June 25, 2018).  Eligibility for that partnership involves \xe2\x80\x9cbroad and consequential assessments of [the country\xe2\x80\x99s] foreign security standards and operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  A foreign government must (among other things) undergo a comprehensive evaluation of its \xe2\x80\x9ccounterterrorism, law enforcement, immigration enforcement, passport security, and border management capabilities,\xe2\x80\x9d often including \xe2\x80\x9coperational site inspections of airports, seaports, land borders, and passport production and issuance facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to authorize a benefit for \xe2\x80\x9cmany of America\xe2\x80\x99s closest allies,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, did not implicitly foreclose the Executive from imposing tighter restrictions on  nationals of certain high-risk countries.  The Visa Waiver Program creates a special exemption for citizens of countries that maintain exemplary security standards and offer \xe2\x80\x9creciprocal [travel] privileges\xe2\x80\x9d to United States citizens.8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71187(a)(2)(A).  But in establishing a select partnership covering less than 20% of the countries in the world, Congress did not address what requirements should govern the entry of nationals from the vast majority of countries that fall short of that gold standard\xe2\x80\x94particularly those nations presenting heightened terrorism concerns.  Nor did Congress attempt to determine\xe2\x80\x94as the multi-agency review process did\xe2\x80\x94whether those high-risk countries provide a minimum baseline of information to adequately vet their nationals.  Once again, this is not a situation where \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has stepped into the space and solved the exact problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 53.</p><p>Although plaintiffs claim that their reading preserves for the President a flexible power to \xe2\x80\x9csupplement\xe2\x80\x9d the INA, their understanding of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority is remarkably cramped: He may suspend entry by classes of aliens \xe2\x80\x9csimilar in nature\xe2\x80\x9d to the existing categories of inadmissibility\xe2\x80\x94but not too similar\xe2\x80\x94or only in response to \xe2\x80\x9csome exigent circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress did not already touch on in the INA.

In any event, no Congress that wanted to confer on the President only a residual authority to address emergency situations would ever use language of the sort in \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  Fairly read, the provision vests authority in the President to impose additional limitations on entry beyond the grounds for exclusion set forth in the INA\xe2\x80\x94including in response to circumstances that might affect the vetting system or other \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Because plaintiffs do not point to any contradiction with another provision of the INA, the President has not  exceeded his authority under \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).</p><p>2</p><p>Plaintiffs seek to locate additional limitations on the scope of \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) in the statutory background and legislative history.  Given the clarity of the text, we need not consider such extra-textual evidence.  See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Rigsby</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  At any rate, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 evidence supports the plain meaning of the provision.</p><p>Drawing on legislative debates over \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0), plaintiffs suggest that the President\xe2\x80\x99s suspension power should be limited to exigencies where it would be difficult for Congress to react promptly.  Precursor provisions enacted during the First and Second World Wars confined the President\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion authority to times of \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnational emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Act of May 22, 1918, \xc2\xa71(a),40Stat.559; Act of June 21, 1941, ch. 210, \xc2\xa71,55Stat.252.  When Congress enacted \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) in 1952, plaintiffs note, it borrowed \xe2\x80\x9cnearly verbatim\xe2\x80\x9d from those predecessor statutes, and one of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors affirmed that the provision would apply only during a time of crisis.  According to plaintiffs, it therefore follows that Congress sought to delegate only a similarly tailored suspension power in \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  Brief for Respondents 39\xe2\x80\x9340.</p><p>If anything, the drafting history suggests the opposite.  In borrowing \xe2\x80\x9cnearly verbatim\xe2\x80\x9d from the pre-existing statute, Congress made one critical alteration\xe2\x80\x94it removed the national emergency standard that plaintiffs now seek to reintroduce<b> </b>in another form.  Weighing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s conscious departure from its wartime statutes against an isolated floor statement, the departure is far more probative.  See <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>SW General, Inc.</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]loor statements by individual legislators rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d).  When Congress wishes to condition an exercise of executive authority on the President\xe2\x80\x99s finding of an exigency or crisis, it knows how to say just that.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824<i>o</i>\xe2\x80\x931(b);42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75192; 50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71701, 1702.  Here, Congress instead chose to condition the President\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of the suspension  authority on a different finding: that the entry of an alien or class of aliens would be \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Plaintiffs also strive to infer limitations from executive practice.  By their count, every previous suspension order under \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) can be slotted into one of two categories.  The vast majority targeted discrete groups of foreign nationals engaging in conduct \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed harmful by the immigration laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the remaining entry restrictions that focused on entire nationalities\xe2\x80\x94namely, President Carter\xe2\x80\x99s response to the Iran hostage crisis and President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s suspension of immigration from Cuba\xe2\x80\x94were, in their view, designed as a response to diplomatic emergencies \xe2\x80\x9cthat the immigration laws do not address.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 40\xe2\x80\x9341.</p><p>Even if we were willing to confine expansive language in light of its past applications, the historical evidence is more equivocal than plaintiffs acknowledge.  Presidents have repeatedly suspended entry not because the covered  nationals themselves engaged in harmful acts but instead to retaliate<b> </b>for conduct by their governments that conflicted with U.\xc2\xa0S. foreign policy interests.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Exec. Order No. 13662, 3 CFR 233 (2014) (President Obama) (suspending entry of Russian nationals working in the financial services, energy, mining, engineering, or defense sectors, in light of the Russian Federation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cannexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x9d); Presidential Proclamation No. 6958, 3 CFR 133 (1997) (President Clinton) (suspending entry of Sudanese governmental and military personnel, citing \xe2\x80\x9cforeign policy interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d based on Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to comply with United Nations resolution).  And while some of these reprisals were directed at subsets of aliens from the countries at issue, others broadly suspended entry on the basis of nationality due to ongoing diplomatic disputes.  For example, President Reagan invoked \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) to suspend entry \xe2\x80\x9cas immigrants\xe2\x80\x9d by almost all Cuban nationals, to apply pressure on the Cuban Government.  Presidential Proclamation No. 5517, 3 CFR 102 (1986).  Plaintiffs try to fit this latter order within their carve-out for emergency action, but the proclamation was based in part on Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s decision to breach an immigration agreement some 15 months earlier.</p><p>More significantly, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument about historical practice is a double-edged sword.  The more ad hoc their account of executive action\xe2\x80\x94to fit the history into their theory\xe2\x80\x94the harder it becomes to see such a refined delegation in a statute that grants the President sweeping authority to decide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, and for how long.</p><p>C</p><p>Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 final statutory argument is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s entry suspension violates \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno person shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\xe2\x80\x99s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of  residence.\xe2\x80\x9d  They contend that we should interpret the provision as prohibiting nationality-based discrimination throughout the <i>entire</i> immigration process, despite the reference in \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) to the act of visa issuance alone.  Specifically, plaintiffs argue that \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) applies to the predicate question of a visa applicant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for admission and the subsequent question whether the holder of a visa may in fact enter the country.  Any other conclusion, they say, would allow the President to circumvent the protections against discrimination enshrined in \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A).</p><p>As an initial matter, this argument challenges only the validity of the entry restrictions on <i>immigrant</i> travel.  Section 1152(a)(1)(A) is expressly limited to the issuance of \xe2\x80\x9cimmigrant visa[s]\xe2\x80\x9d while \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) allows the Presi- dent to suspend entry of  \xe2\x80\x9cimmigrants or nonimmigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d  At a minimum, then, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading would not affect any of the limitations on nonimmigrant travel in the Proclamation.</p><p>In any event, we reject plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation because it ignores the basic distinction between admissibility determinations and visa issuance that runs throughout the INA.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  Section 1182 defines the pool of individuals who are admissible to the United States.  Its restrictions come into play at two points in the process of gaining entry (or admission)[<a href="#F4">4</a>] into the United States.  First, any alien who is inadmissible under \xc2\xa71182 (based on, for example, health risks, criminal history, or foreign policy consequences) is screened out as \xe2\x80\x9cineligible to receive a visa.\xe2\x80\x9d8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71201(g).  Second, even if a consular officer issues a visa, entry into the United States is not guaranteed.  As every visa application explains, a visa does not entitle an alien to enter the United States \xe2\x80\x9cif, upon arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d an immigration officer determines that the applicant is \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible under this chapter, or any other provision of law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  \xc2\xa71201(h).</p><p>Sections 1182(f\xc2\xa0) and 1152(a)(1)(A) thus operate in different spheres: Section 1182 defines the universe of aliens who are admissible into the United States (and therefore eligible to receive a visa).  Once \xc2\xa71182 sets the boundaries of admissibility into the United States, \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) prohibits discrimination in the allocation of immigrant visas based on nationality and other traits.  The distinction between admissibility\xe2\x80\x94to which \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) does not apply\xe2\x80\x94and visa issuance\xe2\x80\x94to which it does\xe2\x80\x94is apparent from the text of the provision, which specifies only that its protections apply to the \xe2\x80\x9cissuance\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cimmigrant visa[s],\xe2\x80\x9d without mentioning admissibility or entry.  Had Congress instead intended in \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) to constrain the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to determine who may enter the country, it could easily have chosen language directed to that end.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(3)(C)(ii), (iii) (providing that certain aliens \xe2\x80\x9c<i>shall not be excludable or subject to restrictions or conditions on entry</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that [Congress] did not adopt [a] readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports\xe2\x80\x9d the conclusion that \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) does not limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegated authority under \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 181, 188 (2008).</p><p>Common sense and historical practice confirm as much.  Section 1152(a)(1)(A) has never been treated as a constraint on the criteria for admissibility in \xc2\xa71182.  Presidents have repeatedly exercised their authority to suspend entry on the basis of nationality.  As noted, President Reagan relied on \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) to suspend entry \xe2\x80\x9cas immigrants by all Cuban nationals,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to exceptions.  Proclamation No. 5517, 51 Fed. Reg. 30470 (1986).  Likewise, President Carter invoked \xc2\xa71185(a)(1) to deny and revoke visas to all Iranian nationals.  See Exec. Order No. 12172, 3 CFR 461 (1979), as amended by Exec. Order No. 12206, 3 CFR 249 (1980); Public Papers of the Presidents, Jimmy Carter, Sanctions Against Iran, Vol. 1, Apr. 7, 1980, pp. 611\xe2\x80\x93612 (1980); see also n.\xc2\xa01, <i>supra</i>.</p><p>On plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading, those orders were beyond the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  The entry restrictions in the Proclamation on North Korea (which plaintiffs do not challenge in this litigation) would also be unlawful.  Nor would the President be permitted to suspend entry from particular foreign states in response to an epidemic confined to a single region, or a verified terrorist threat involving nationals of a specific foreign nation, or even if the United States were on the brink of war.</p><p>In a reprise of their \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0) argument, plaintiffs attempt to soften their position by falling back on an implicit exception for Presidential actions that are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to address \xe2\x80\x9cspecific fast-breaking exigencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  Yet the absence of any textual basis for such an exception more likely indicates that Congress did not intend for \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s flexible authority to suspend entry based on foreign policy interests.  In addition, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed exigency test would require courts, rather than the President, to determine whether a foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s conduct rises to the level that would trigger a supposed implicit exception to a federal statute.  See <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.</i>,525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 491 (1999) (explaining that even if the Executive \xe2\x80\x9cdisclose[d] its .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasons for deeming nationals of a particular country a special threat,\xe2\x80\x9d courts would be \xe2\x80\x9cunable to assess their adequacy\xe2\x80\x9d).  The text of \xc2\xa71152(a)(1)(A) offers no standards that would enable courts to assess, for example, whether the situation in North Korea justifies entry restrictions while the terrorist threat in Yemen does not.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>The Proclamation is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority under the INA.

That is an issue here because the entry restrictions apply not to plaintiffs themselves but to others seeking to enter the United States.</p><p>Plaintiffs first argue that they have standing on the ground that the Proclamation \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes a disfavored faith\xe2\x80\x9d and violates \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own right to be free from federal [religious] establishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (emphasis deleted).

Likewise, one of our prior stay orders in this litigation recognized that an American individual who has \xe2\x80\x9ca bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trump </i>v. <i>IRAP</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p><p>The Government responds that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Establishment Clause claims are not justiciable because the Clause does not give them a legally protected interest in the admission of particular foreign nationals.

We therefore conclude that the individual plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the exclusion of their relatives under the Establishment Clause.</p><p>B</p><p>The First Amendment provides, in part, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our cases recognize that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Larson</i> v. <i>Valente</i>,456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228, 244 (1982).  Plaintiffs believe that the Proclamation violates this prohibition by singling out Muslims for disfavored treatment.  The entry suspension, they contend, operates as a \xe2\x80\x9creligious gerrymander,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because most of the countries covered by the Proclamation have Muslim-majority populations.  And in their view, deviations from the information-sharing baseline criteria suggest that the results of the multi-agency review were \xe2\x80\x9cforeordained.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on Establishment Clause precedents concerning laws and policies applied domestically, plaintiffs allege that the primary purpose of the Proclamation was religious animus and that the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated concerns about vetting protocols and national security were but pretexts for discriminating against Muslims.  Brief for Respondents 69\xe2\x80\x9373.</p><p>At the heart of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 case is a series of statements by the President and his advisers casting doubt on the official objective of the Proclamation.

Yet it cannot be denied that the Federal Government and the Presidents who have carried its laws into effect have\xe2\x80\x94from the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s earliest days\xe2\x80\x94performed unevenly in living up to those inspiring words.</p><p>Plaintiffs argue that this President\xe2\x80\x99s words strike at fundamental standards of respect and tolerance, in violation of our constitutional tradition.  But the issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements.  It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.  In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.</p><p>The case before us differs in numerous respects from the conventional Establishment Clause claim.  Unlike the typical suit involving religious displays or school prayer, plaintiffs seek to invalidate a national security directive regulating the entry of aliens abroad.  Their claim accordingly raises a number of delicate issues regarding the scope of the constitutional right and the manner of proof.  The Proclamation, moreover, is facially neutral toward religion.  Plaintiffs therefore ask the Court to probe the sincerity of the stated justifications for the policy by reference to extrinsic statements\xe2\x80\x94many of which were made before the President took the oath of office.  These various aspects of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge inform our standard of review.</p><p>C</p><p>For more than a century, this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s political departments largely immune from judicial control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fiallo</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787, 792 (1977); see <i>Harisiades</i> v. <i>Shaughnessy</i>,342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 580, 588\xe2\x80\x93589 (1952) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations [and] the war power.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because decisions in these matters may implicate \xe2\x80\x9crelations with foreign powers,\xe2\x80\x9d or involve \xe2\x80\x9cclassifications defined in the light of changing political and economic circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d such judgments \xe2\x80\x9care frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mathews</i> v. <i>Diaz</i>,426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 67, 81 (1976).</p><p>Nonetheless, although foreign nationals seeking admission have no constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.  In <i>Kleindienst</i> v. <i>Mandel</i>, the Attorney General denied admission to a Belgian journalist and self-described \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionary Marxist,\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest Mandel, who had been invited to speak at a conference at Stanford University.  408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 756\xe2\x80\x93757.  The professors who wished to hear Mandel speak challenged that decision under the First Amendment, and we acknowledged that their constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cright to receive information\xe2\x80\x9d was implicated.  <i>Id.</i>, at 764\xe2\x80\x93765.  But we limited our review to whether the Executive gave a \xe2\x80\x9cfacially legitimate and bona fide\xe2\x80\x9d reason for its action.  <i>Id.</i>, at 769.  Given the authority of the political branches over admission, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Executive exercises this [delegated] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification\xe2\x80\x9d against the asserted constitutional interests of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens.  <i>Id.</i>, at 770.</p><p>The principal dissent suggests that <i>Mandel </i>has no bearing on this case, <i>post, </i>at 14, and n.\xc2\xa05 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (hereinafter the dissent), but our opinions have reaffirmed and applied its deferential standard of review across different contexts and constitutional claims.  In <i>Din</i>, Justice Kennedy reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 broad power over the creation and administration of the immigration system\xe2\x80\x9d meant that the Government need provide only a statutory citation to explain a visa denial.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).  Likewise in <i>Fiallo</i>, we applied <i>Mandel</i> to a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad congressional policy\xe2\x80\x9d giving immigration preferences to mothers of illegitimate children.  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 795.  Even though the statute created a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d entry classification that discriminated on the basis of sex and legitimacy, <i>post, </i>at 14, n.\xc2\xa05, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not the judicial role in cases of this sort to probe and test the justifications\xe2\x80\x9d of immigration policies.  430 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 799 (citing <i>Mandel</i>, 408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 770).  Lower courts have similarly applied <i>Mandel </i>to broad executive action.  See <i>Rajah</i> v. <i>Mukasey</i>, 544 F. 3d 427, 433, 438\xe2\x80\x93439 (CA2 2008) (upholding National Security Entry-Exit Registration System instituted after September 11, 2001).</p><p><i>Mandel</i>\xe2\x80\x99s narrow standard of review \xe2\x80\x9chas particular force\xe2\x80\x9d in admission and immigration cases that overlap with \xe2\x80\x9cthe area of national security.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Din</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).  For one, \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial inquiry into the national-security realm raises concerns for the separation of powers\xe2\x80\x9d by intruding on the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs.  <i>Ziglar</i> v. <i>Abbasi</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For another, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it comes to collecting evidence and drawing inferences\xe2\x80\x9d on questions of national security, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 34.</p><p>The upshot of our cases in this context is clear: \xe2\x80\x9cAny rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility\xe2\x80\x9d of the President \xe2\x80\x9cto respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,\xe2\x80\x9d and our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.  <i>Mathews</i>, 426 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 81\xe2\x80\x9382.  We need not define the precise contours of that inquiry in this case.  A conventional application of <i>Mandel</i>, asking only whether the policy is facially legitimate and bona fide, would put an end to our review.  But the Government has suggested that it may be appropriate here for the inquiry to extend beyond the facial neutrality of the order.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\xe2\x80\x9317, 25\xe2\x80\x9327 (describing <i>Mandel</i> as \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point\xe2\x80\x9d of the analysis).  For our purposes today, we assume that we may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying rational basis review.  That standard of review considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes.  See <i>Railroad Retirement Bd.</i> v. <i>Fritz</i>,449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 166, 179 (1980).  As a result, we may consider plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 extrinsic evidence, but will uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>D</p><p>Given the standard of review, it should come as no surprise that the Court hardly ever strikes down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny.  On the few occasions where we have done so, a common thread has been that the laws at issue lack any purpose other than a \xe2\x80\x9cbare .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Department of Agriculture</i> v. <i>Moreno</i>,413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528, 534 (1973).<b> </b>In one case, we invalidated a local zoning ordinance that required a special permit for group homes for the intellectually disabled, but not for other facilities such as fraternity houses or hospitals.  We did so on the ground that the city\xe2\x80\x99s stated concerns about (among other things) \xe2\x80\x9clegal responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrowded conditions\xe2\x80\x9d rested on \xe2\x80\x9can irrational prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d against the intellectually dis- abled.  <i>Cleburne</i> v. <i>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.</i>,473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432, 448\xe2\x80\x93450 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And in another case, this Court overturned a state constitutional amendment that denied gays and lesbians access to the protection of antidiscrimination laws.  The amendment, we held, was \xe2\x80\x9cdivorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cits sheer breadth [was] so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it\xe2\x80\x9d that the initiative seemed \xe2\x80\x9cinexplicable by anything but animus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Romer</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 620, 632, 635 (1996).</p><p>The Proclamation does not fit this pattern.  It cannot be said that it is impossible to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern a relationship to legitimate state interests\xe2\x80\x9d or that the policy is \xe2\x80\x9cinexplicable by anything but animus.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, the dissent can only attempt to argue otherwise by refusing to apply anything resembling rational basis review.  But because there is persuasive evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility, we must accept that independent justification.</p><p>The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices.  The text says nothing about religion.  Plaintiffs and the dissent nonetheless emphasize that five of the seven nations currently included in the Proclamation have Muslim-majority populations.  Yet that fact alone does not support an inference of religious hostility, given that the policy covers just 8% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.  See8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71187(a)(12)(A) (identifying Syria and state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran as \xe2\x80\x9ccountr[ies] or area[s] of concern\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of administering the Visa Waiver Program); Dept. of Homeland Security, DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program (Feb. 18, 2016) (designating Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern); see also <i>Rajah</i>, 544 F. 3d, at 433, n. 3 (describing how nonimmigrant aliens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen were covered by the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System).</p><p>The Proclamation, moreover, reflects the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their agencies.  Plaintiffs seek to discredit the findings of the review, pointing to deviations from the review\xe2\x80\x99s baseline criteria resulting in the inclusion of Somalia and omission of Iraq.  But as the Proclamation explains, in each case the determinations were justified by the distinct conditions in each country.  Although Somalia generally satisfies the information-sharing component of the baseline criteria, it \xe2\x80\x9cstands apart .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the degree to which [it] lacks command and control of its territory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Proclamation \xc2\xa72(h)(i).  As for Iraq, the Secretary of Homeland Security determined that entry restrictions were not warranted in light of the close cooperative relationship between the U.\xc2\xa0S. and Iraqi Governments and the country\xe2\x80\x99s key role in combating terrorism in the region.  \xc2\xa71(g).  It is, in any event, difficult to see how exempting one of the largest predominantly Muslim countries in the region from coverage under the Proclamation can be cited as evidence of animus toward Muslims.</p><p>The dissent likewise doubts the thoroughness of the multi-agency review because a recent Freedom of Information Act request shows that the final DHS report \xe2\x80\x9cwas a mere 17 pages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 19.  Yet a simple page count offers little insight into the actual substance of the final report, much less predecisional materials underlying it.  See5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(5) (exempting deliberative materials from FOIA disclosure).</p><p>More fundamentally, plaintiffs and the dissent challenge the entry suspension based on their perception of its effectiveness and wisdom.  They suggest that the policy is overbroad and does little to serve national security interests.  But we cannot substitute our own assessment for the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s predictive judgments on such matters, all of which \xe2\x80\x9care delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Waterman S. S. Corp.</i>,333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, 111 (1948); see also <i>Regan</i> v. <i>Wald</i>,468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222, 242\xe2\x80\x93243 (1984) (declining invitation to conduct an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent foreign policy analysis\xe2\x80\x9d).  While we of course \xe2\x80\x9cdo not defer to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the underlying facts is entitled to appropriate weight, particularly in the context of litigation involving \xe2\x80\x9csensitive and weighty interests of national security and foreign affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>Three additional features of the entry policy support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim of a legitimate national security interest.  First, since the President introduced entry restrictions in January 2017, three Muslim-majority countries\xe2\x80\x94Iraq, Sudan, and Chad\xe2\x80\x94have been removed from the list of covered countries.  The Proclamation emphasizes that its \xe2\x80\x9cconditional restrictions\xe2\x80\x9d will remain in force only so long as necessary to \xe2\x80\x9caddress\xe2\x80\x9d the identified \xe2\x80\x9cinadequacies and risks,\xe2\x80\x9d Proclamation Preamble, and \xc2\xa71(h), and establishes an ongoing process to engage covered nations and assess every 180 days whether the entry restrictions should be terminated, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a), (b).  In fact, in announcing the termination of restrictions on nationals of Chad, the President also described Libya\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing engagement with the State Department and the steps Libya is taking \xe2\x80\x9cto improve its practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Proclamation No. 9723, 83 Fed. Reg. 15939.</p><p>Second, for those countries that remain subject to entry restrictions, the Proclamation includes significant exceptions for various categories of foreign nationals.  The policy permits nationals from nearly every covered country to travel to the United States on a variety of nonimmigrant visas.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), (g), (h) (permitting student and exchange visitors from Iran, while restricting only business and tourist nonimmigrant entry for nationals of Libya and Yemen, and imposing no restrictions on nonimmigrant entry for Somali nationals).  These carveouts for nonimmigrant visas are substantial: Over the last three fiscal years\xe2\x80\x94before the Proclamation was in effect\xe2\x80\x94the majority of visas issued to nationals from the covered countries were nonimmigrant visas.  Brief for Petitioners 57.  The Proclamation also exempts permanent resi- dents and individuals who have been granted asylum.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(b)(i), (vi).</p><p>Third, the Proclamation creates a waiver program open to all covered foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants.  According to the Proclamation, consular officers are to consider in each admissibility determination whether the alien demonstrates that (1) denying entry would cause undue hardship; (2) entry would not pose a threat to public safety; and (3) entry would be in the interest of the United States.  \xc2\xa73(c)(i); see also \xc2\xa73(c)(iv) (listing examples of when a waiver might be appropriate, such as if the foreign national seeks to reside with a close family member, obtain urgent medical care, or pursue significant business obligations).  On its face, this program is similar to the humanitarian exceptions set forth in President Carter\xe2\x80\x99s order during the Iran hostage crisis.  See Exec. Order No. 12206, 3 CFR 249; Public Papers of the Presidents, Jimmy Carter, Sanctions Against Iran, at 611\xe2\x80\x93612 (1980) (outlining exceptions).  The Proclamation also directs DHS and the State Department to issue guidance elaborating upon the circumstances that would justify a waiver.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p><p>Finally, the dissent invokes <i>Korematsu</i> v. <i>United States</i>,323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214 (1944).  Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, <i>Korematsu </i>has nothing to do with this case.  The forcible relocation of U. S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority.  But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission.  See <i>post,</i> at 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  The entry suspension is an act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President\xe2\x80\x94the only question is evaluating the actions of this particular President in promulgating an otherwise valid Proclamation.</p><p>The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reference to <i>Korematsu</i>, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: <i>Korematsu </i>was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and\xe2\x80\x94to be clear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas no place in law under the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248 (Jackson, J., dissenting).</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>Under these circumstances, the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review.  We express no view on the soundness of the policy.  We simply hold today that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim.</p><p>V</p><p>Because plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, we reverse the grant of the preliminary injunction as an abuse of discretion.  <i>Winter</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 7, 32 (2008).

There are several more.  Section 1182(f) does not set forth any judicially enforceable limits that constrain the President.  See <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 592, 600 (1988).  Nor could it, since the President has <i>inherent </i>authority to exclude aliens from the country.  See <i>United States ex rel. Knauff</i>\xc2\xa0v.\xc2\xa0<i>Shaughnessy</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 537, 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (1950); accord, <i>Sessions</i> v. <i>Dimaya</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).  Further, the Establishment Clause does not create an individual right to be free from all laws that a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable observer\xe2\x80\x9d views as religious or antireligious.  See <i>Town of Greece</i> v. <i>Galloway</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6); <i>Elk Grove Unified School Dist. </i>v. <i>Newdow</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 52\xe2\x80\x9353 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  The plaintiffs cannot raise any other\n \nFirst Amendment claim, since the alleged religious discrimination in this case was directed at aliens abroad.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259, 265 (1990).  And, even on its own terms, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proffered evidence of anti-Muslim discrimination is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Merits aside, I write separately to address the remedy that the plaintiffs sought and obtained in this case.  The District Court imposed an injunction that barred the Government from enforcing the President\xe2\x80\x99s Proclamation against anyone, not just the plaintiffs.  Injunctions that prohibit the Executive Branch from applying a law or policy against anyone\xe2\x80\x94often called \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide\xe2\x80\x9d injunctions\xe2\x80\x94have become increasingly common.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  District courts, including the one here, have begun imposing universal injunctions without considering their authority to grant such sweeping relief.  These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system\xe2\x80\x94preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions.  These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding.  And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts.  If their popularity continues, this Court must address their legality.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If district courts have any authority to issue universal injunctions, that authority must come from a statute or the Constitution.  See <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Jenkins</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">124 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring).  No statute expressly grants district courts the power to issue universal injunctions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  So the only possible bases for these injunctions are a generic statute that authorizes equitable relief or the courts\xe2\x80\x99 inherent constitutional authority.  Neither of those sources would permit a form of injunctive relief that is \xe2\x80\x9c[in]consistent with our history and traditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This Court has never treated general statutory grants of equitable authority as giving federal courts a freewheeling power to fashion new forms of equitable remedies.  Rather, it has read such statutes as constrained by \xe2\x80\x9cthe body of law which had been transplanted to this country from the English Court of Chancery\xe2\x80\x9d in 1789.  <i>Guaranty Trust Co. </i>v. <i>York</i>,\n\n326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 99, 105 (1945).  As Justice Story explained, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csettled doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d under such statutes is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedies in equity are to be administered .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. according to the practice of courts of equity in [England].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Boyle </i>v. <i>Zacharie &amp; Turner</i>, 6 Pet. 648, 658 (1832).  More recently, this Court reiterated that broad statutory grants of equitable authority give federal courts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an authority to administer in equity suits the principles of the system of judicial remedies which had been devised and was being administered by the English Court of Chancery at the time of the separation of the two countries.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.\xc2\xa0A. </i>v. <i>Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308, 318 (1999) (Scalia, J.) (quoting <i>Atlas Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>W. I. Southern, Inc.</i>,\n\n306 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563, 568 (1939)).</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"> </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The same is true of the courts\xe2\x80\x99 inherent constitutional authority to grant equitable relief, assuming any such authority exists.  See <i>Jenkins</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 124 (Thomas, J., concurring).  This authority is also limited by the traditional rules of equity that existed at the founding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The scope of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 equitable authority under the Constitution was a point of contention at the founding, and the \xe2\x80\x9cmore limited construction\xe2\x80\x9d of that power prevailed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 126.  The founding generation viewed equity \xe2\x80\x9cwith suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 128.  Several anti-Federalists criticized the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s extension of the federal judicial power to \xe2\x80\x9cCase[s] in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Equity,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72, as \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing] the judge a discretionary power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letters from The Federal Farmer No. XV (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 315, 322 (H. Storing ed. 1981).  That discretionary power, the anti-Federalists alleged, would allow courts to \xe2\x80\x9cexplain the constitution according to the reasoning spirit of it, without being confined to the words or letter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Essays of Brutus No. XI (Jan. 31, 1788), in <i>id.,</i> at 417, 419\xe2\x80\x93420.  The Federalists responded to this concern by emphasizing the limited nature of equity.  Hamilton explained that the judiciary would be \xe2\x80\x9cbound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (Federalist).  Although the purpose of a court of equity was \xe2\x80\x9cto give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe principles by which that relief is governed are now reduced to a regular system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i> No. 83 at 505 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Federalists\xe2\x80\x99 explanation was consistent with how equity worked in 18th-century England.  English courts of equity applied established rules not only when they decided the merits, but also when they fashioned remedies. Like other aspects of equity, \xe2\x80\x9cthe system of relief administered by a court of equity\xe2\x80\x9d had been reduced \xe2\x80\x9cinto a regular science.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 440\xe2\x80\x93441 (1768) (Blackstone).  As early as 1768, Blackstone could state that the \xe2\x80\x9cremedy a suitor is entitled to expect\xe2\x80\x9d could be determined \xe2\x80\x9cas readily and with as much precision, in a court of equity as in a court of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 441.  Although courts of equity exercised remedial \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion,\xe2\x80\x9d that discretion allowed them to deny or tailor a remedy despite a demonstrated violation of a right, not to expand a remedy beyond its traditional scope.  See G. Keeton, An Introduction to Equity 117\xe2\x80\x93118 (1938).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, whether the authority comes from a statute or the Constitution, district courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to provide equitable relief is meaningfully constrained.  This author- ity must comply with longstanding principles of equity that predate this country\xe2\x80\x99s founding.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Universal injunctions do not seem to comply with those principles.  These injunctions are a recent development, emerging for the first time in the 1960s and dramatically increasing in popularity only very recently.  And they appear to conflict with several traditional rules of equity, as well as the original understanding of the judicial role.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Equity originated in England as a means for the Crown to dispense justice by exercising its sovereign authority.  See Adams, The Origins of English Equity, 16 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 87, 91 (1916).  Petitions for equitable relief were referred to the Chancellor, who oversaw cases in equity.  See 1 S. Symon\xe2\x80\x99s, Pomeroy\xe2\x80\x99s, Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa733 (5th ed. 1941) (Pomeroy); G. McDowell, Equity and the Constitution 24 (1982).  The Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s equitable jurisdiction was based on the \xe2\x80\x9creserve of justice in the king.\xe2\x80\x9d F. Maitland, Equity 3 (2d ed. 1936); see also 1 Pomeroy \xc2\xa733, at 38 (describing the Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s equitable authority as an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94that of <i>Grace</i>\xe2\x80\x94by delegation\xe2\x80\x9d from the King).  Equity allowed the sovereign to afford discretionary relief to parties where relief would not have been available under the \xe2\x80\x9crigors of the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jenkins</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 127 (opinion of Thomas, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The English system of equity did not contemplate universal injunctions.  As an agent of the King, the Chancellor had no authority to enjoin him.  See Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 417, 425 (2017) (Bray).  The Chancellor could not give \xe2\x80\x9cany relief against the king, or direct any act to be done by him, or make any decree disposing of or affecting his property; not even in cases where he is a royal trustee.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Blackstone 428.  The Attorney General could be sued in Chancery, but not in cases that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98immediately concerned\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the interests of the Crown.  Bray 425 (citing 1 E. Daniell, The Practice of the High Court of Chancery 138 (2d ed. 1845)).  American courts inherited this tradition.  See J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleadings \xc2\xa769 (1838) (Story).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, as a general rule, American courts of equity did not provide relief beyond the parties to the case.  If their injunctions advantaged nonparties, that benefit was merely incidental.  Injunctions barring public nuisances were an example.  While these injunctions benefited third parties, that benefit was merely a consequence of providing relief to the plaintiff.  Woolhandler &amp; Nelson, Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 689, 702 (2004) (Woolhandler &amp; Nelson); see <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co.</i>, 13 How. 518, 564 (1852) (explaining that a private \xe2\x80\x9cinjury makes [a public nuisance] a private nuisance to the injured party\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">True, one of the recognized bases for an exercise of equitable power was the avoidance of \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplicity of suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bray 426; accord, 1 Pomeroy \xc2\xa7243.  Courts would employ \xe2\x80\x9cbills of peace\xe2\x80\x9d to consider and resolve a number of suits in a single proceeding.  <i>Id</i>., \xc2\xa7246.  And some authorities stated that these suits could be filed by one plaintiff on behalf of a number of others.  <i>Id</i>., \xc2\xa7251.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d was that \xe2\x80\x9call persons materially interested .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the subject-matter of a suit, are to be made <i>parties</i> to it .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , however numerous they may be, so that there may be a complete decree, which shall bind them all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Story \xc2\xa772, at 61 (emphasis added).  And, in all events, these \xe2\x80\x9cproto-class action[s]\xe2\x80\x9d were limited to a small group of similarly situated plaintiffs having some right in common.  Bray 426\xe2\x80\x93427; see also Story \xc2\xa7120, at 100 (explaining that such suits were \xe2\x80\x9calways\xe2\x80\x9d based on \xe2\x80\x9ca common interest or a common right\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">American courts\xe2\x80\x99 tradition of providing equitable relief only to parties was consistent with their view of the nature of judicial power.  For most of our history, courts understood judicial power as \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentall[y] the power to render judgments in individual cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Murphy</i> v. <i>National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).  They did not believe that courts could make federal policy, and they did not view judicial review in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cstriking down\xe2\x80\x9d laws or regulations.  See <i>id., </i>at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  Misuses of judicial power, Hamilton reassured the people of New York, could not threaten \xe2\x80\x9cthe general liberty of the people\xe2\x80\x9d because courts, at most, adjudicate the rights of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Federalist No. 78, at 466.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s limited role was also reflected in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions about who could sue to vindicate certain rights.  See <i>Spokeo, Inc.</i> v. <i>Robins</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934).  A plaintiff could not bring a suit vindicating public rights\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>rights held by the community at large\xe2\x80\x94without a showing of some specific injury to himself.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  And a plaintiff could not sue to vindicate the private rights of someone else.  See Woolhandler &amp; Nelson 715\xe2\x80\x93716.  Such claims were considered to be beyond the authority of courts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 711\xe2\x80\x93717.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has long respected these traditional limits on equity and judicial power.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Donald</i>,\n\n165 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107, 115 (1897) (rejecting an injunction based on the theory that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cso represents [a] class\xe2\x80\x9d whose rights were infringed by a statute as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo conjectural to furnish a safe basis upon which a court of equity ought to grant an injunction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Take, for example, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon</i>,\n\n262 U.\xc2\xa0S. 447 (1923).  There, a taxpayer sought to enjoin the enforcement of an appropriation statute.  The Court noted that this kind of dispute \xe2\x80\x9cis essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 487.  A general interest in enjoining implementation of an illegal law, this Court explained, provides \xe2\x80\x9cno basis .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Courts can review the constitutionality of an act only when \xe2\x80\x9ca justiciable issue\xe2\x80\x9d requires it to decide whether to \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard an unconstitutional enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 488.  If the statute is unconstitutional, then courts enjoin \xe2\x80\x9cnot the execution of the statute, but the acts of the official.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Courts cannot issue an injunction based on a mere allegation \xe2\x80\x9cthat officials of the executive department of the government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cTo do so would be not to decide a judicial controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By the latter half of the 20th century, however, some jurists began to conceive of the judicial role in terms of resolving general questions of legality, instead of addressing those questions only insofar as they are necessary to resolve individual cases and controversies.  See Bray 451.  That is when what appears to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe first [universal] injunction in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d emerged.  Bray 438.  In<i> Wirtz</i> v. <i>Baldor Elec</i>.<i> Co</i>., 337 F.\xc2\xa02d 518 (CADC 1963), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressed a lawsuit challenging the Secretary of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the prevailing minimum wage for a particular industry.  <i>Id.</i>, at 520.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit concluded that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s determination was unsupported, but remanded for the District Court to assess whether any of the plaintiffs had standing to challenge it.  <i>Id.,</i> at 521\xe2\x80\x93535.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit also addressed the question of remedy, explaining that if a plaintiff had standing to sue then \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court should enjoin .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s determination with respect to the <i>entire industry</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 535 (emphasis added).  To justify this broad relief, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit explained that executive officers should honor judicial decisions \xe2\x80\x9cin all cases of essentially the same character.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 534.  And it noted that, once a court has decided an issue, it \xe2\x80\x9cwould ordinarily give the same relief to any individual who comes to it with an essentially similar cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit added that the case was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly a proceeding in which those who have standing are here to vindicate the public interest in having congressional enactments prop- erly interpreted and applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 534\xe2\x80\x93535.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Universal injunctions remained rare in the decades following <i>Wirtz</i>.  See Bray 440\xe2\x80\x93445.  But recently, they have exploded in popularity.  See <i>id.,</i> at 457\xe2\x80\x93459.  Some scholars have criticized the trend.  See generally <i>id.,</i> at 457\xe2\x80\x93465; Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(b)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.\xc2\xa0U.

Pol\xe2\x80\x99y 487, 521\xe2\x80\x93538 (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">No persuasive defense has yet been offered for the practice. Defenders of these injunctions contend that they ensure that individuals who did not challenge a law are treated the same as plaintiffs who did, and that universal injunctions give the judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.  See Amdur &amp; Hausman, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. Forum 49, 51, 54 (2017); Malveaux, Class Actions, Civil Rights, and the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. Forum 56, 57, 60\xe2\x80\x9362 (2017).  But these arguments do not explain how these injunctions are consistent with the historical limits on equity and judicial power.  They at best \xe2\x80\x9cboi[l] down to a policy judgment\xe2\x80\x9d about how powers ought to be allocated among our three branches of government.  <i>Perez</i> v. <i>Mortgage Bankers Assn.</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 23).

Whether judicial proceedings may properly continue in this case, in light of the substantial deference that is and must be accorded to the Executive in the conduct of foreign affairs, and in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, is a matter to be addressed in the first instance on remand.  And even if further proceedings are permitted, it would be necessary to determine that any discovery and other preliminary matters would not themselves intrude on the foreign affairs power of the Executive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In all events, it is appropriate to make this further observation.  There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of Government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention.  That does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects.  The oath that all officials take to adhere to the Constitution is not confined to those spheres in which the Judiciary can correct or even comment upon what those officials say or do.  Indeed, the very fact that an official may have broad discretion, discretion free from judicial scrutiny, makes it all the more imperative for him or her to adhere to the Constitution and to its meaning and its promise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits the establishment of religion and promises the free exercise of religion.  From these safeguards, and from the guarantee of freedom of speech, it follows there is freedom of belief and expression.  It is an urgent necessity that officials adhere to these constitutional guarantees and mandates in all their actions, even in the sphere of foreign affairs.  An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.   </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3920353">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 17\xe2\x80\x93965</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">DONALD J.

If its promulgation or content was significantly affected by religious animus against Muslims, it would violate the relevant statute or the\n \nFirst Amendment itself.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(f) (requiring \xe2\x80\x9cfind[ings]\xe2\x80\x9d that persons denied entry \xe2\x80\x9cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520 (1993) (\n \nFirst Amendment); <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. </i>v. <i>Colorado Civil Rights Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018) (same); <i>post, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  If, however, its sole <i>ratio decidendi</i> was one of national security, then it would be unlikely to violate either the statute or the Constitution.  Which is it?  Members of the Court principally disagree about the answer to this question, <i>i.e., </i>about<i> </i>whether or the extent to which religious animus played a significant role in the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s promulgation or content.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate system of exemptions and waivers can and should help us answer this question.  That system provides for case-by-case consideration of persons who may qualify for visas despite the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s general ban.  Those persons include lawful permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, students, children, and numerous others.  There are likely many such persons, perhaps in the thousands.  And I believe it appropriate to take account of their Proclamation-granted status when considering the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s lawfulness.  The Solicitor General asked us to consider the Proclamation \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9cwritten\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9capplied,\xe2\x80\x9d waivers and exemptions included.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.  He warned us against considering the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s lawfulness \xe2\x80\x9con the hypothetical situation that [the Proclamation] is what it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.,</i> while telling us that its waiver and exemption provisions mean what they say: The Proclamation does not exclude individuals from the United States \xe2\x80\x9cif they meet the criteria\xe2\x80\x9d for a waiver or exemption.  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the one hand, if the Government is applying the exemption and waiver provisions as written, then its argument for the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s lawfulness is strengthened.  For one thing, the Proclamation then resembles more closely the two important Presidential precedents on point, President Carter\xe2\x80\x99s Iran order and President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba proclamation, both of which contained similar categories of persons authorized to obtain case-by-case exemptions.  <i>Ante,</i> at 36\xe2\x80\x9337; Exec. Order No. 12172, 44 Fed. Reg. 67947 (1979), as amended by Exec. Order No. 12206, 45 Fed. Reg. 24101 (1980); Presidential Proclamation No. 5517, 51 Fed. Reg. 30470 (1986).  For another thing, the Proclamation then follows more closely the basic statutory scheme, which provides for strict case-by-case scrutiny of applications.  It would deviate from that system, not across the board, but where circumstances may require that deviation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, since the case-by-case exemptions and waivers apply without regard to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s religion, application of that system would help make clear that the Proclamation does not deny visas to numerous Muslim individuals (from those countries) who do not pose a security threat.  And that fact would help to rebut the\n \nFirst Amendment claim that the Proclamation rests upon anti-Muslim bias rather than security need.  Finally, of course, the very fact that Muslims from those countries would enter the United States (under Proclamation-provided exemptions and waivers) would help to show the same thing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the other hand, if the Government is <i>not </i>applying the system of exemptions and waivers that the Proclamation contains, then its argument for the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s lawfulness becomes significantly weaker.  For one thing, the relevant precedents\xe2\x80\x94those of Presidents Carter and Reagan\xe2\x80\x94would bear far less resemblance to the present Proclamation.  Indeed, one might ask, if those two Presidents thought a case-by-case exemption system appropriate, what is different about present circumstances that would justify that system\xe2\x80\x99s absence?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another thing, the relevant statute requires that there be \xe2\x80\x9cfind[ings]\xe2\x80\x9d that the grant of visas to excluded persons would be \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71182(f\xc2\xa0).  Yet there would be no such findings in respect to those for whom the Proclamation itself provides case-by-case examination (followed by the grant of a visa in appropriate cases).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And, perhaps most importantly, if the Government is not applying the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s exemption and waiver system, the claim that the Proclamation is a \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim ban,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity-based\xe2\x80\x9d ban, becomes much stronger.  How could the Government successfully claim that the Proclamation rests on security needs if it is excluding Muslims who satisfy the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s own terms?  At the same time, denying visas to Muslims who meet the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s own security terms would support the view that the Government excludes them for reasons based upon their religion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unfortunately there is evidence that supports the second possibility, <i>i.e., </i>that the Government is not applying the Proclamation as written.  The Proclamation provides that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security \xe2\x80\x9cshall coordinate to adopt guidance\xe2\x80\x9d for consular officers to follow when deciding whether to grant a waiver.  \xc2\xa73(c)(ii).  Yet, to my knowledge, no guidance has issued.  The only potentially relevant document I have found consists of a set of State Department answers to certain Frequently Asked Questions, but this document simply restates the Proclamation in plain language for visa applicants.  It does not provide guidance for consular officers as to how they are to exercise their discretion.  See Dept. of State, FAQs on the Presidential Proclamation, https:// travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information- resources/presidential-proclamation-archive/2017-12-04-Presidential-Proclamation.html (all Internet materials as last visited June 25, 2018).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> An examination of publicly available statistics also provides cause for concern.  The State Department reported that during the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s first month, two waivers were approved out of 6,555 eligible applicants.  Letter from M. Waters, Assistant Secretary Legislative Affairs, to Sen. Van Hollen (Feb. 22, 2018).  In its reply brief, the Government claims that number increased from 2 to 430 during the first four months of implementation.  Reply Brief 17.  That number, 430, however, when compared with the number of pre-Proclamation visitors, accounts for a miniscule percentage of those likely eligible for visas, in such categories as persons requiring medical treatment, academic visitors, students, family members, and others belonging to groups that, when considered as a group (rather than case by case), would not seem to pose security threats.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amici</i> have suggested that there are numerous applicants who could meet the waiver criteria.  For instance, the Proclamation anticipates waivers for those with \xe2\x80\x9csignificant business or professional obligations\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States, \xc2\xa73(c)(iv)(C), and <i>amici</i> identify many scholars who would seem to qualify.  Brief for Colleges and Universities as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 25\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for American Council on Education et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 20 (identifying more than 2,100 scholars from covered countries); see also Brief for Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (identifying technology and business leaders from covered countries).  The Proclamation also anticipates waivers for those with a \xe2\x80\x9cclose family member (<i>e.g., </i>a spouse, child, or parent)\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States, \xc2\xa73(c)(iv)(D), and <i>amici</i> identify many such individuals affected by the Proclamation.  Brief for Labor Organizations as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15\xe2\x80\x9318 (identifying children and other relatives of U. S. citizens).  The Pars Equality Center identified 1,000 individuals\xe2\x80\x94including parents and children of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens\xe2\x80\x94who sought and were denied entry under the Proclamation, hundreds of whom seem to meet the waiver criteria.  See Brief for Pars Equality Center et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other data suggest the same.  The Proclamation does not apply to asylum seekers or refugees.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(b)(vi), 6(e).  Yet few refugees have been admitted since the Proclamation took effect.  While more than 15,000 Syrian refugees arrived in the United States in 2016, only 13 have arrived since January 2018.  Dept. of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, Interactive Reporting, Refugee Processing Center, http://ireports.wrapsnet.org.  Similarly few refugees have been admitted since January from Iran (3), Libya (1), Yemen (0), and Somalia (122).  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Proclamation also exempts individuals applying for several types of nonimmigrant visas: lawful permanent residents, parolees, those with certain travel documents, dual nationals of noncovered countries, and representatives of governments or international organizations.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(b)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(v).  It places no restrictions on the vast majority of student and exchange visitors, covering only those from Syria, which provided 8 percent of student and exchange visitors from the five countries in 2016.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(b)\xe2\x80\x93(h); see Dept. of State, Report of the Visa Office 2016, Table XVII Nonimmigrant Visas Issued Fiscal Year 2016 (Visa Report 2016 Table XVII).  Visitors from Somalia are eligible for any type of nonimmigrant visa, subject to \xe2\x80\x9cadditional scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(h)(ii).  If nonimmigrant visa applications under the Proclamation resemble those in 2016, 16 percent of visa applicants would be eligible for exemptions.  See Visa Report 2016 Table XVII.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In practice, however, only 258 student visas were issued to applicants from Iran (189), Libya (29), Yemen (40), and Somalia (0) in the first three months of 2018.  See Dept. of State, Nonimmigrant Visa Issuances by Nationality, Jan., Feb., and Mar. 2018.  This is less than a quarter of the volume needed to be on track for 2016 student visa levels.  And only 40 nonimmigrant visas have been issued to Somali nationals, a decrease of 65 percent from 2016.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see Visa Report 2016 Table XVII.  While this is but a piece of the picture, it does not provide grounds for confidence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Anecdotal evidence further heightens these concerns.  For example, one <i>amicus</i> identified a child with cerebral palsy in Yemen.  The war had prevented her from receiving her medication, she could no longer move or speak, and her doctors said she would not survive in Yemen.  Her visa application was denied.  Her family received a form with a check mark in the box unambiguously confirming that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a waiver will not be granted in your case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from L. Blatt to S. Harris, Clerk of Court (May 1, 2018).  But after the child\xe2\x80\x99s case was highlighted in an <i>amicus</i> brief before this Court, the family received an update from the consular officer who had initially denied the waiver.  It turns out, according to the officer, that she had all along determined that the waiver criteria were met.  But, the officer explained, she could not relay that information at the time because the waiver required review from a supervisor, who had since approved it.  The officer said that the family\xe2\x80\x99s case was now in administrative processing and that she was attaching a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98revised refusal letter indicating the approval of the waiver.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The new form did not actually approve the waiver (in fact, the form contains no box saying \xe2\x80\x9cgranted\xe2\x80\x9d).  But a different box was now checked, reading: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The consular officer is reviewing your eligibility for a waiver under the Proclamation.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. This can be a lengthy process, and until the consular officer can make an individualized determination of [the relevant] factors, your visa application will remain refused under Section 212(f) [of the Proclamation].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  One is left to wonder why this second box, indicating continuing review, had not been checked at the outset if in fact the child\xe2\x80\x99s case had remained under consideration all along.  Though this is but one incident and the child was admitted after considerable international attention in this case, it provides yet more reason to believe that waivers are not being processed in an ordinary way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, in a pending case in the Eastern District of New York, a consular official has filed a sworn affidavit asserting that he and other officials do not, in fact, have discretion to grant waivers.  According to the affidavit, consular officers \xe2\x80\x9cwere not allowed to exercise that discretion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe waiver [process] is merely \xe2\x80\x98window dressing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See Decl. of Christopher Richardson, <i>Alharbi </i>v. <i>Miller</i>, No. 1:18-cv-2435 (June 1, 2018), pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Another report similarly indicates that the U.\xc2\xa0S. Embassy in Djibouti, which processes visa applications for citizens of Yemen, received instructions to grant waivers \xe2\x80\x9conly in rare cases of imminent danger,\xe2\x80\x9d with one consular officer reportedly telling an applicant that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]ven for infants, we would need to see some evidence of a congenital heart defect or another medical issue of that degree of difficulty that\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0would likely lead to the child\xe2\x80\x99s developmental harm or death.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Center for Constitutional Rights and the Rule of Law Clinic, Yale Law School, Window Dressing the Muslim Ban: Reports of Waivers and Mass Denials from Yemeni-American Families Stuck in Limbo 18 (2018).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Declarations, anecdotal evidence, facts, and numbers taken from <i>amicus </i>briefs are not judicial factfindings.  The Government has not had an opportunity to respond, and a court has not had an opportunity to decide.  But, given the importance of the decision in this case, the need for assurance that the Proclamation does not rest upon a \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim ban,\xe2\x80\x9d and the assistance in deciding the issue that answers to the \xe2\x80\x9cexemption and waiver\xe2\x80\x9d questions may provide, I would send this case back to the District Court for further proceedings.  And, I would leave the injunction in effect while the matter is litigated.  Regardless, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today leaves the District Court free to explore these issues on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If this Court must decide the question without this further litigation, I would, on balance, find the evidence of antireligious bias, including statements on a website taken down only after the President issued the two executive orders preceding the Proclamation, along with the other statements also set forth in Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, a sufficient basis to set the Proclamation aside.  And for these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3920354">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 17\xe2\x80\x93965</p><p>_________________</p><p>DONALD J.

Our Founders honored that core promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in the First Amendment.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today fails to safeguard that fundamental principle.  It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\xe2\x80\x9d because the policy now masquerades behind a fa\xc3\xa7ade of national-security concerns.  But this repackaging does little to cleanse Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 of the appearance of discrimination that the President\xe2\x80\x99s words have created.  Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.  That alone suffices to show that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim.  The majority holds otherwise by ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens.  Because that troubling result runs contrary to the Constitution and our precedent, I dissent.</p><p>I</p><p>Plaintiffs challenge the Proclamation on various grounds, both statutory and constitutional.  Ordinarily, when a case can be decided on purely statutory grounds, we strive to follow a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Zobrest</i> v. <i>Catalina Foothills School Dist.</i>,509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 8 (1993).  But that rule of thumb is far from categorical, and it has limited application where, as here, the constitutional question proves far simpler than the statutory one.  Whatever the merits of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complex statutory claims, the Proclamation must be enjoined for a more fundamental reason: It runs afoul of the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of religious neutrality.</p><p>A</p><p>The Establishment Clause forbids government policies \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 1.  The \xe2\x80\x9cclearest command\xe2\x80\x9d of the Establishment Clause is that the Government cannot favor or disfavor one religion over another.  <i>Larson</i> v. <i>Valente</i>,456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228, 244 (1982); <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520, 532 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he First Amendment forbids an official purpose to disapprove of a particular religion\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Aguillard</i>,482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578, 593 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Establishment Clause .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. forbids <i>alike </i>the preference of a religious doctrine <i>or </i>the prohibition of theory which is deemed antagonistic to a particular dogma\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Donnelly</i>,465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, 673 (1984) (noting that the Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cforbids hostility toward any [religion],\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9csuch hostility would bring us into \xe2\x80\x98war with our national tradition as embodied in the First Amendmen[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Epperson</i> v. <i>Arkansas</i>,393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 97, 106 (1968) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he State may not adopt programs or practices .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which aid or oppose any religion.

Consistent with that clear command, this Court has long acknowledged that governmental actions that favor one religion \xe2\x80\x9cinevitabl[y]\xe2\x80\x9d foster \xe2\x80\x9cthe hatred, disrespect and even contempt of those who [hold] contrary beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Engel</i> v. <i>Vitale</i>,370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 421, 431 (1962).

The full record paints a far more harrowing picture, from which a reasonable observer would readily conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by hostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.</p><p>During his Presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged that, if elected, he would ban Muslims from entering the United States.  Specifically, on December 7, 2015, he issued a formal statement \xe2\x80\x9ccalling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 119.  That statement, which remained on his campaign website until May 2017 (several months into his Presidency), read in full:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\xe2\x80\x99s representatives can figure out what is going on.  According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.  Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing \xe2\x80\x9825% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\xe2\x80\x99 and 51% of those polled \xe2\x80\x98agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\xe2\x80\x99  Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against nonbelievers who won\xe2\x80\x99t convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trum[p] stated, \xe2\x80\x98Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension.  Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine.  Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of the horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect of human life.  If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Donald J. Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 158; see also <i>id.</i>, at 130\xe2\x80\x93131.</p><p>On December 8, 2015, Trump justified his proposal during a television interview by noting that President Franklin D. Roosevelt \xe2\x80\x9cdid the same thing\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.  <i>Id.</i>, at 120.  In January 2016, during a Republican primary debate, Trump was asked whether he wanted to \xe2\x80\x9crethink [\xc2\xa0his] position\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cbanning Muslims from entering the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  He answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  A month later, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump told an apocryphal story about United States General John J. Pershing killing a large group of Muslim insurgents in the Philippines with bullets dipped in pigs\xe2\x80\x99 blood in the early 1900\xe2\x80\x99s.  <i>Id.</i>, at 163\xe2\x80\x93164.  In March 2016, he expressed his belief that \xe2\x80\x9cIslam hates us. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [W]e can\xe2\x80\x99t allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [a]nd of people that are not Muslim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 120\xe2\x80\x93121.  That same month, Trump asserted that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e\xe2\x80\x99re having problems with the Muslims, and we\xe2\x80\x99re having problems with Muslims coming into the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 121.  He therefore called for surveillance of mosques in the United States, blaming terrorist attacks on Muslims\xe2\x80\x99 lack of \xe2\x80\x9cassimilation\xe2\x80\x9d and their commitment to \xe2\x80\x9csharia law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>id.</i>, at 164.  A day later, he opined that Muslims \xe2\x80\x9cdo not respect us at all\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t respect a lot of the things that are happening throughout not only our country, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t respect other things.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>As Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign progressed, he began to describe his policy proposal in slightly different terms.  In June 2016, for instance, he characterized the policy proposal as a suspension of immigration from countries \xe2\x80\x9cwhere there\xe2\x80\x99s a proven history of terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 121.  He also described the proposal as rooted in the need to stop \xe2\x80\x9cimporting radical Islamic terrorism to the West through a failed immigration system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 121\xe2\x80\x93122.  Asked in July 2016 whether he was \xe2\x80\x9cpull[ing] back from\xe2\x80\x9d his pledged Muslim ban, Trump responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI actually don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a rollback.  In fact, you could say it\xe2\x80\x99s an expansion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 122\xe2\x80\x93123.  He then explained that he used different terminology because \xe2\x80\x9c[p]eople were so upset when [he] used the word Muslim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 123.</p><p>A month before the 2016 election, Trump reiterated that his proposed \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim ban\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cmorphed into a[n] extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Then, on December 21, 2016, President-elect Trump was asked whether he would \xe2\x80\x9crethink\xe2\x80\x9d his previous \xe2\x80\x9cplans to create a Muslim registry or ban Muslim immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know my plans.  All along, I\xe2\x80\x99ve proven to be right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>On January 27, 2017, one week after taking office, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, 82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (2017) (EO\xe2\x80\x931), entitled \xe2\x80\x9cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  As he signed it, President Trump read the title, looked up, and said \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 124.  That same day, President Trump explained to the media that, under EO\xe2\x80\x931, Christians would be given prior- ity for entry as refugees into the United States.  In particu- lar, he bemoaned the fact that in the past, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f you were a Muslim [refugee from Syria] you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 125.  Considering that past policy \xe2\x80\x9cvery unfair,\xe2\x80\x9d President Trump explained that EO\xe2\x80\x931 was designed \xe2\x80\x9cto help\xe2\x80\x9d the Christians in Syria.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The following day, one of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s key advisers candidly drew the connection between EO\xe2\x80\x931 and the \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim ban\xe2\x80\x9d that the President had pledged to implement if elected.  <i>Ibid.  </i>According to that adviser, \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen [Donald Trump] first announced it, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Muslim ban.\xe2\x80\x99  He called me up. He said, \xe2\x80\x98Put a commission together.  Show me the right way to do it legally.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>On February 3, 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington enjoined the enforcement of EO\xe2\x80\x931.  See <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Trump, </i>2017 WL 462040, *3.  The Ninth Circuit denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request to stay that injunction.  <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Trump</i>, 847 F.\xc2\xa03d 1151, 1169 (2017) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Rather than appeal the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Government declined to continue defending EO\xe2\x80\x931 in court and instead announced that the President intended to issue a new executive order to replace EO\xe2\x80\x931.</p><p>On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued that new executive order, which, like its predecessor, imposed temporary entry and refugee bans.  See Exec. Order No. 13,780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (EO\xe2\x80\x932).  One of the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisers publicly explained that EO\xe2\x80\x932 would \xe2\x80\x9chave the same basic policy outcome\xe2\x80\x9d as EO\xe2\x80\x931, and that any changes would address \xe2\x80\x9cvery technical issues that were brought up by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 127.  After EO\xe2\x80\x932 was issued, the White House Press Secretary told reporters that, by issuing EO\xe2\x80\x932, President Trump \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue[d] to deliver on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. his most significant campaign promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 130.  That statement was consistent with President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s own declaration that \xe2\x80\x9cI keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 127\xe2\x80\x93128.</p><p>Before EO\xe2\x80\x932 took effect, federal District Courts in Hawaii and Maryland enjoined the order\xe2\x80\x99s travel and refugee bans.  See <i>Hawaii </i>v. <i>Trump</i>, 245 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 1227, 1239 (Haw. 2017); <i>International Refugee Assistance Project </i>(<i>IRAP</i>) v. <i>Trump</i>, 241 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 539, 566 (Md. 2017).  The Fourth and Ninth Circuits upheld those injunctions in substantial part.  <i>IRAP </i>v. <i>Trump</i>, 857 F.\xc2\xa03d 554, 606 (CA4 2017) (en banc); <i>Hawaii </i>v. <i>Trump</i>, 859 F.\xc2\xa03d 741, 789 (CA9 2017) (<i>per curiam</i>).  In June 2017, this Court granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari and issued a <i>per curiam</i> opinion partially staying the District Courts\xe2\x80\x99 injunctions pending further review.  In particular, the Court allowed EO\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x99s travel ban to take effect except as to \xe2\x80\x9cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trump </i>v. <i>IRAP</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12).</p><p>While litigation over EO\xe2\x80\x932 was ongoing, President Trump repeatedly made statements alluding to a desire to keep Muslims out of the country.  For instance, he said at a rally of his supporters that EO\xe2\x80\x932 was just a \xe2\x80\x9cwatered down version of the first one\xe2\x80\x9d and had been \xe2\x80\x9ctailor[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d at the behest of \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 131.  He further added that he would prefer \xe2\x80\x9cto go back to the first [executive order] and go all the way\xe2\x80\x9d and reiterated his belief that it was \xe2\x80\x9cvery hard\xe2\x80\x9d for Muslims to assimilate into Western culture.  <i>Id.</i>, at 131\xe2\x80\x93132.  During a rally in April 2017, President Trump recited the lyrics to a song called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snake,\xe2\x80\x9d a song about a woman who nurses a sick snake back to health but then is attacked by the snake, as a warning about Syrian refugees entering the country.  <i>Id.</i>, at 132, 163.  And in June 2017, the President stated on Twitter that the Justice Department had submitted a \xe2\x80\x9cwatered down, politically correct version\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9coriginal Travel Ban\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto S[upreme]\xc2\xa0C[ourt].\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  <i>Id.</i>, at 132.  The President went on to tweet: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 132\xe2\x80\x93133.  He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won\xe2\x80\x99t help us protect our people!\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 133.  Then, on August 17, 2017, President Trump issued yet another tweet about Islam, once more referencing the story about General Pershing\xe2\x80\x99s massacre of Muslims in the Philippines: \xe2\x80\x9cStudy what General Pershing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. did to terrorists when caught.  There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>IRAP</i> v. <i>Trump</i>, 883 F.\xc2\xa03d 233, 267 (CA4 2018) (<i>IRAP II</i>) (en banc) (alterations in original).</p><p>In September 2017, President Trump tweeted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific\xe2\x80\x94but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 133.  Later that month, on September 24, 2017, President Trump issued Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017) (Proclamation), which restricts entry of certain nationals from six Muslim-majority countries.  On November 29, 2017, President Trump \xe2\x80\x9cretweeted\xe2\x80\x9d three anti-Muslim videos, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cIslamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  <i>IRAP II\xc2\xa0</i>, 883 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 267.  Those videos were initially tweeted by a British political party whose mission is to oppose \xe2\x80\x9call alien and destructive politic[al] or religious doctrines, including .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  When asked about these videos, the White House Deputy Press Secretary connected them to the Proclamation, responding that the \xe2\x80\x9cPresident has been talking about these security issues for years now, from the campaign trail to the White House\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas addressed these issues with the travel order that he issued earlier this year and the companion proclamation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>2</p><p>As the majority correctly notes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue before us is not whether to denounce\xe2\x80\x9d these offensive statements.  <i>Ante, </i>at 29.  Rather, the dispositive and narrow question here is whether a reasonable observer, presented with all \xe2\x80\x9copenly available data,\xe2\x80\x9d the text and \xe2\x80\x9chistorical context\xe2\x80\x9d of the Proclamation, and the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific sequence of events\xe2\x80\x9d leading to it, would conclude that the primary purpose of the Proclamation is to disfavor Islam and its adherents by excluding them from the country.  See <i>McCreary</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 862\xe2\x80\x93863.  The answer is unquestionably yes.</p><p>Taking all the relevant evidence together, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was driven primarily by anti-Muslim animus, rather than by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s asserted national-security justifications.  Even before being sworn into office, then-candidate Trump stated that \xe2\x80\x9cIslam hates us,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 399, warned that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e\xe2\x80\x99re having problems with the Muslims, and we\xe2\x80\x99re having problems with Muslims coming into the country,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 121, promised to enact a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 119, and instructed one of his advisers to find a \xe2\x80\x9clega[l\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d way to enact a Muslim ban, <i>id.</i>, at 125.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  The President continued to make similar statements well after his inauguration, as detailed above, see <i>supra</i>, at<i> </i>6\xe2\x80\x9310.</p><p>Moreover, despite several opportunities to do so, President Trump has never disavowed any of his prior statements about Islam.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  Instead, he has continued to make remarks that a reasonable observer would view as an unrelenting attack on the Muslim religion and its followers.  Given President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s failure to correct the reasonable perception of his apparent hostility toward the Islamic faith, it is unsurprising that the President\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers have, at every step in the lower courts, failed in their attempts to launder the Proclamation of its discriminatory taint.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fordice</i>,505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 717, 746\xe2\x80\x93747 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[G]iven an initially tainted policy, it is eminently reasonable to make the [Government] bear the risk of nonpersuasion with respect to intent at some future time, both because the [Government] has created the dispute through its own prior unlawful conduct, and because discriminatory intent does tend to persist through time\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  Notably, the Court recently found less pervasive official expressions of hostility and the failure to disavow them to be constitutionally significant.  Cf. <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Colorado Civil Rights Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners\xe2\x80\x99 comments\xe2\x80\x94comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by the State at any point in the proceedings that led to the affirmance of the order\xe2\x80\x94were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires\xe2\x80\x9d).  It should find the same here.</p><p>Ultimately, what began as a policy explicitly \xe2\x80\x9ccalling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\xe2\x80\x9d has since morphed into a \xe2\x80\x9cProclamation\xe2\x80\x9d putatively based on national-security concerns.  But this new window dressing cannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the President and his advisers create the strong perception that the Proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers.</p><p>II</p><p>Rather than defend the President\xe2\x80\x99s problematic statements, the Government urges this Court to set them aside and defer to the President on issues related to immigration and national security.  The majority accepts that invitation and incorrectly applies a watered-down legal standard in an effort to short circuit plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Establishment Clause claim.</p><p>The majority begins its constitutional analysis by noting that this Court, at times, \xe2\x80\x9chas engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 30 (citing <i>Kleindienst</i> v. <i>Mandel</i>,408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753 (1972)).

Even so, the Proclamation, just like its predecessors, overwhelmingly targets Muslim-majority nations.  Given the record here, including all the President\xe2\x80\x99s statements linking the Proclamation to his apparent hostility toward Muslims, it is of no moment that the Proclamation also includes minor restrictions on two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela, or that the Government has removed a few Muslim-majority countries from the list of covered countries since EO\xe2\x80\x931 was issued.  Consideration of the entire record supports the conclusion that the inclusion of North Korea and Venezuela, and the removal of other countries, simply reflect subtle efforts to start \xe2\x80\x9ctalking territory instead of Muslim,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 123, precisely so the Executive Branch could evade criticism or legal consequences for the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise clear targeting of Muslims.  The Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s effect on North Korea and Venezuela, for example, is insubstantial, if not entirely symbolic.  A prior sanctions order already restricts entry of North Korean nationals, see Exec. Order No. 13810, 82 Fed. Reg. 44705 (2017), and the Proclamation targets only a handful of Venezuelan government officials and their immediate family members, 82 Fed. Reg. 45166.  As such, the President\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of North Korea and Venezuela does little to mitigate the anti-Muslim animus that permeates the Proclamation.</p><p>The majority next contends that the Proclamation \xe2\x80\x9creflects the results of a worldwide review process under- taken by multiple Cabinet officials.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ante,</i> at 34.  At the out- set, there is some evidence that at least one of the individuals involved in that process may have exhibited bias against Muslims.  As noted by one group of <i>amici</i>,<i> </i>the Trump administration appointed Frank Wuco to help enforce the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel bans and lead the multi- agency review process.

Furthermore, evidence of which we can take judicial notice indicates that the multiagency review process could not have been very thorough.

To determine which countries are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, the Government considers whether they can satisfy numerous criteria\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g., </i>using electronic, fraud-resistant passports, \xc2\xa71187(a)(3)(B), 24-hour reporting of lost or stolen passports, \xc2\xa71187(c)(2)(D), and not providing a safe haven for terrorists, \xc2\xa71187(a)(12)(D)(iii).

Eligibility for the program is reassessed on an annual basis.  See \xc2\xa71187(a)(12)(D)(iii), 1187(c)(12)(A).

See Brief for Former National Security Officials as <i>Amici Curiae </i>27.</p><p>Put simply, Congress has already erected a statutory scheme that fulfills the putative national-security interests the Government now puts forth to justify the Proclamation.  Tellingly, the Government remains wholly unable to articulate any credible national-security interest that would go unaddressed by the current statutory scheme absent the Proclamation.  The Government also offers no evidence that this current vetting scheme, which involves a highly searching consideration of individuals required to obtain visas for entry into the United States and a highly searching consideration of which countries are eligible for inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program, is inadequate to achieve the Proclamation\xe2\x80\x99s proclaimed objectives of \xe2\x80\x9cpreventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their [vetting and information-sharing] practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 34.</p><p>For many of these reasons, several former national-security officials from both political parties\xe2\x80\x94including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger III, former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\xe2\x80\x94have advised that the Proclamation and its predecessor orders \xe2\x80\x9cdo not advance the national-security or foreign policy interests of the United States, and in fact do serious harm to those interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Former National Security Officials as <i>Amici Curiae </i>15 (boldface deleted).</p><p>Moreover, the Proclamation purports to mitigate national-security risks by excluding nationals of countries that provide insufficient information to vet their nationals.  82 Fed.

See Brief for Respondents 72.  In addition, the Proclamation permits certain nationals from the countries named in the Proclamation to obtain nonimmigrant visas, which undermines the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that it does not already have the capacity and sufficient information to vet these individuals adequately.

See Brief for Japanese American Citizens League as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>12\xe2\x80\x9314. <i> </i>As here, the exclusion order was rooted in dangerous stereotypes about, <i>inter alia</i>, a particular group\xe2\x80\x99s supposed inability to assimilate and desire to harm the United States.  See <i>Korematsu</i>,<i> </i>323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236\xe2\x80\x93240 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  As here, the Government was unwilling to reveal its own intelligence agencies\xe2\x80\x99 views of the alleged security concerns to the very citizens it purported to protect.  Compare <i>Korematsu</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 584 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1406, 1418\xe2\x80\x931419 (ND Cal. 1984) (discussing information the Government knowingly omitted from report presented to the courts justifying the executive order); Brief for Japanese American Citizens League as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>17\xe2\x80\x9319, with <i>IRAP II</i>, 883 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 268; Brief for Karen Korematsu et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 35\xe2\x80\x9336, and n.\xc2\xa05 (noting that the Government \xe2\x80\x9chas gone to great lengths to shield [the Secretary of Homeland Security\xe2\x80\x99s] report from view\xe2\x80\x9d).  And as here, there was strong evidence that impermissible hostility and animus moti- vated the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy.</p><p>Although a majority of the Court in <i>Korematsu </i>was willing to uphold the Government\xe2\x80\x99s actions based on a barren invocation of national security, dissenting Justices warned of that decision\xe2\x80\x99s harm to our constitutional fabric.  Justice Murphy recognized that there is a need for great deference to the Executive Branch in the context of national security, but cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9cit is essential that there be definite limits to [the government\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ndividuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on a plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support.\xe2\x80\x9d  323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  Justice Jackson lamented that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy would prove to be \xe2\x80\x9ca far more subtle blow to liberty than the promulgation of the order itself,\xe2\x80\x9d for although the executive order was not likely to be long lasting, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to tolerate it would endure.  <i>Id.,</i> at 245\xe2\x80\x93246.</p><p>In the intervening years since <i>Korematsu</i>, our Nation has done much to leave its sordid legacy behind.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa74211 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq. </i>(setting forth remedies to individuals affected by the executive order at issue in <i>Korematsu</i>); Non-Detention Act of 1971,18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74001(a) (forbidding the imprisonment or detention by the United States of any citizen absent an Act of Congress).  Today, the Court takes the important step of finally overruling <i>Korematsu</i>, denouncing it as \xe2\x80\x9cgravely wrong the day it was decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 38 (citing <i>Korematsu</i>, 323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248 (Jackson, J., dissenting)).  This formal repudiation of a shameful precedent is laud- able and long overdue.  But it does not make the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision here acceptable or right.  By blindly accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the Court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying <i>Korematsu</i> and merely replaces one \xe2\x80\x9cgravely wrong\xe2\x80\x9d decision with another.  <i>Ante,</i> at 38.</p><p>Our Constitution demands, and our country deserves, a Judiciary willing to hold the coordinate branches to account when they defy our most sacred legal commitments.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today has failed in that respect, with profound regret, I dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0According to the White House, President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s statements on Twitter are \xe2\x80\x9cofficial statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 133. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2">2</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The content of these videos is highly inflammatory, and their titles are arguably misleading.

First, <i>Mandel</i> and <i>Din</i> each involved a constitutional challenge to an Executive Branch decision to exclude a single foreign national under a specific statutory ground of inadmissibility.  <i>Mandel</i>, 408 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 767; <i>Din</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Here, by contrast, President Trump is not exercising his discretionary authority to determine the admission or exclusion of a particular foreign national.  He promulgated an executive order affecting millions of individuals on a categorical basis.  Second, <i>Mandel</i> and <i>Din</i> did not purport to establish the framework for adjudicating cases (like this one) involving claims that the Executive Branch violated the Establishment Clause by acting pursuant to an unconstitutional purpose.  Applying <i>Mandel</i>\xe2\x80\x99s narrow standard of review to such a claim would run contrary to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated admonition that \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]acial neutrality is not determinative\xe2\x80\x9d in the Establishment Clause context.  <i>Lukumi</i>, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534.  Likewise, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s passing invocation of <i>Fiallo</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 787 (1977), is misplaced.  <i>Fiallo</i>, unlike this case, addressed a constitutional challenge to a statute enacted by Congress, not an order of the President.  <i>Id.,</i> at 791.  <i>Fiallo</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>application of <i>Mandel </i>says little about whether <i>Mandel</i>\xe2\x80\x99s narrow standard of review applies to the unilateral executive proclamation promulgated under the circumstances of this case. <i> </i>Finally, even assuming that <i>Mandel </i>and <i>Din </i>apply here, they would not preclude us from looking behind the face of the Proclamation because plaintiffs have made \xe2\x80\x9can affirmative showing of bad faith,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Din</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5), by the President who, among other things, instructed his subordinates to find a \xe2\x80\x9clega[l]\xe2\x80\x9d way to enact a Muslim ban, App. 125; see <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x9310. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T6">6</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The majority chides as \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d the importation of Establishment Clause jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9cin the national security and foreign affairs context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333, n.\xc2\xa05.

But just because the Court has not confronted the precise situation at hand does not render these cases (or the principles they announced) inapplicable.  Moreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s complaint regarding the lack of direct authority is a puzzling charge, given that the majority itself fails to cite any \xe2\x80\x9cauthority for its proposition\xe2\x80\x9d that a more probing review is inappropriate in a case like this one, where United States citizens allege that the Executive has violated the Establishment Clause by issuing a sweeping executive order motivated by animus.  <i>Ante</i>, at 33 n.\xc2\xa05; see <i>supra,</i> at 14, and n.\xc2\xa05.  In any event, even if there is no prior case directly on point, it is clear from our precedent that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of national security and foreign affairs, \xe2\x80\x9cit most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hamdi</i> v. <i>Rumsfeld</i>,542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion).

See <i>McCreary</i>, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 860.  That reasonable-observer inquiry includes consideration of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s asserted justifications for its actions.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of a national-security justification, however, does not mean that the Court should close its eyes to other relevant information.
