JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 781-b of the New York Penal Law makes it a crime to distribute in quantity, among other things, any handbill for another which contains any statement concerning any candidate in connection with any election of public officers, without also printing thereon the name and post office address of the printer thereof and of the person at whose instance such handbill is so distributed. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 389 U. S. 243</a></p><p> Appellant was convicted of violating the statute by distributing anonymous handbills critical of the record of a United States Congressman seeking reelection at the 1964 elections.  The conviction was reversed, on state law grounds, by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Term, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 389 U. S. 244</a></p><p> without opinion, 16 N.Y.2d 1069, 266 N.Y.S.2d 140, 213 N.E.2d 467.  Thereafter, appellant, invoking the District Court\'s jurisdiction under he Civil Rights Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York on the ground that, on its face, the statute was repugnant to the guarantees of free expression secured by the Federal Constitution.  His contention, below and in this Court, is that the statute suffers from impermissible "overbreadth" in that its sweep embraces anonymous handbills both within and outside the protection of the First Amendment.  <em>Cf. Talley v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/60/case.html">362 U. S. 60</a></span>.  A three-judge court, one judge dissenting, applied the doctrine of abstention and dismissed the complaint, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] remitting appellant to the New York courts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 389 U. S. 245</a></p><p> to assert his constitutional challenge in defense of any criminal prosecution for any future violations of the statute or, short of this, to the institution of "an action in the state court for a declaratory judgment." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  261 F.Supp. 985, 993.  Because appellant\'s appeal presents an important question of the scope of the discretion of the district courts to abstain from deciding the merits of a challenge that a state statute on its face violates the Federal Constitution, we noted probable jurisdiction.  386 U.S. 906.  We reverse.</p>\n<p>We shall consider <em>first</em> whether abstention from the declaratory judgment sought by appellant would have been appropriate in the absence of his request for injunctive relief, and <em>second,</em> if not, whether abstention was nevertheless justified because appellant also sought an injunction against future criminal prosecutions for violation of \xc2\xa7 781-b.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>During most of the Nation\'s first century, Congress relied on the state courts to vindicate essential rights arising under the Constitution and federal laws.  The only exception was the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, providing for review in this Court when a claim of federal right was denied by a state court. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 389 U. S. 246</a></p><p> But that policy was completely altered after the Civil War, when nationalism dominated political thought [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and brought with it congressional investiture of the federal judiciary with enormously increased powers.  The Act of March 3, 1875, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] was the principal ". . . measure of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 389 U.

S. 668</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/668/case.html#673">373 U. S. 673</a></span>.  By that statute</p>\n<p>". . . Congress gave the federal courts the vast range of power which had lain dormant in the Constitution since 1789.  These courts ceased to be restricted tribunals of fair dealing between citizens of different states and became the <em>primary</em> and powerful reliances for vindicating every right given by the Constitution, the laws, and treaties of the Untied States."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Frankfurter &amp; Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court:  A Study in the Federal Judicial System 65. Indeed, even before the 1875 Act, Congress, in the Civil Rights Act of 1871, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] subjected to suit,</p>\n<p>"[e]very person who, under color of any statute . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws . . . ,"</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, and gave the district courts "original jurisdiction" of actions "[t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State law . . . of any right . . . secured by the Constitution. . . ."  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 389 U. S. 248</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In thus expanding federal judicial power, Congress imposed the duty upon all levels of the federal judiciary to give due respect to a suitor\'s choice of a federal forum for the hearing and decision of his federal constitutional claims.  Plainly, escape from that duty is not permissible merely because state courts also have the solemn responsibility, equally with the federal courts, ". . . to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . ," <em>Robb v.

Appellee supports this holding by reliance upon the maxim that a federal district court should be slow to act "where its powers are invoked to interfere by injunction with threatened criminal prosecutions in a state court."  <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html">319 U.

We have recently recognized the continuing validity of that pronouncement.  <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U.

However, appellant here did not, as did the plaintiffs in <em>Douglas,</em> 319 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html#159">319 U. S. 159</a></span>, seek solely to "restrain threatened criminal prosecution of [him] in the state courts. . . ."  Rather, he also requested a declaratory judgment that the state statute underlying the apprehended criminal prosecution was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The majority below, although recognizing that <em>Douglas</em> might be inapposite to this case, 261 F.Supp. at 990, read <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister</em> as requiring abstention from considering appellant\'s request for a declaratory judgment in the absence of a showing by appellant of "special </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 389 U. S. 254</a></p><p> circumstances to justify the exercise of federal court jurisdiction . . ." to grant injunctive relief.  261 F.Supp. at 991.  Since the majority found no "special circumstances" justifying that relief, the majority concluded that it was also required to abstain from considering the request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>This conclusion was error.  <em>Dombrowski</em> teaches that the questions of abstention and of injunctive relief are not the same. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The question of the propriety of the action of the District Court in abstaining was discussed as an independent issue governed by different considerations.  We squarely held that</p>\n<p>"the abstention doctrine is inappropriate for cases such as the present one where . . . statutes are justifiably attacked on their face as abridging free expression. . . ."</p>\n<p>380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#489">380 U.

Bullitt, supra,</em> "[t]his is not a case where abstention pending state court interpretation would be appropriate. . . ."</p>\n<p>It follows that the District Court\'s views on the question of injunctive relief are irrelevant to the question of abstention here.  For a request for a declaratory judgment that a state statute is overbroad on its face must be considered independently of any request for injunctive relief against the enforcement of that statute.  We hold that a federal district court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction.  <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette, supra,</em> is not contrary.  That case involved only the request for injunctive relief.  The Court refused </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 389 U.

Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/105/case.html">319 U. S. 105</a></span>.  Comity between the federal and Pennsylvania courts was deemed sufficient reason to justify the holding that,</p>\n<p>"in view of the decision rendered today in <em>Murdock</em> . . . , we find no ground for supposing that the intervention of a federal court, in order to secure petitioners\' constitutional rights, will be either necessary or appropriate."</p>\n<p>319 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html#165">319 U.

It will be the task of the District Court on the remand to decide whether an injunction will be "necessary or appropriate" should appellant\'s prayer for declaratory relief prevail.

The first of these interests has been found in cases in which the federal constitutional issue might be mooted or "presented in a different posture" [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] by a state court determination of pertinent state law.  <em>See, e.g., Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/168/case.html">316 U. S. 168</a></span>; <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v.

McAdory,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/450/case.html">325 U. S. 450</a></span>.  The second of these interests has been found, for example, in situations in which the exercise of jurisdiction by a federal court would disrupt a state administrative process, <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/315/case.html">319 U. S. 315</a></span>; interfere with the collection of state taxes, <em>Toomer v.

S. 392</a></span>; or otherwise create "needless friction" between the enforcement of state and federal policies.  <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/25/case.html#33">360 U. S. 33</a></span>.  <em>See also Harrison v. NAACP, supra.</em></p>\n<p>I agree that the present situation is within none of these categories, and that the District Court should therefore not have dismissed, but proceeded to judgment on the issues in the case. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In particular, I can find in this statute no room for a state construction which might obviate the need for a decision on the constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 389 U. S. 257</a></p><p> issue.  If, however, the opinion of the Court is intended to suggest that the central, or even a principal, issue in deciding the propriety of abstention is whether the complaint has alleged "overbreadth," or only "vagueness," with respect to the New York statute in question, I cannot agree.  My reasons are three.  First, neither principle has ever been definitively delimited by this Court; a doctrine built upon their supposed differences would be likely to founder for lack of a foundation.  <em>See generally</em> Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67.  Second, there is no reason to suppose that a case involving allegations of overbreadth would inevitably be inappropriate for abstention; the federal court might nonetheless reasonably consider that its exercise of jurisdiction would create "needless friction" with state officials, <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/25/case.html#33">360 U. S. 33</a></span>; or it might reasonably conclude that a state court determination would present the federal issues "in a different posture."  <em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/185/case.html#189">360 U. S. 189</a></span>.  Third, such a standard might in effect reduce the abstention doctrine to a pleader\'s option; the fundamental interests served by the doctrine would be jettisoned whenever a complainant had sufficient foresight to insert into his pleading an allegation of overbreadth.  I can see no proper alternative to a careful examination, in light of the interests served by abstention, of the circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court, substantially for the reasons given in its opinion, that whether or not injunctive relief might ultimately prove appropriate in this instance is not a pertinent question at this stage of the matter.</p>\n<p>I accordingly concur in the judgment of the Court, but, in doing so, wish to emphasize that, like the Court, I intimate no view whatever upon the merits of the constitutional challenge to this statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/185/case.html#189">360 U. S. 189</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Unlike the Court, I obtain no assistance for this conclusion from the ubiquitous and slippery "chilling effect" doctrine.  Appellant might have sought in the state courts the declaratory relief he now asks.  N.Y.Civ.Prac. \xc2\xa7 3001.  Given the state courts\' disposition of appellant\'s earlier prosecution, he can scarcely maintain that those courts would not promptly provide any relief to which he is entitled.  Absent such allegations, it is difficult to see how that doctrine can have the slightest relevance.  <em>See Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#499">380 U. S. 499</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  In these circumstances, to apply the amorphous chilling-effect doctrine would serve only to chill the interests sought to be maintained by abstention.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
