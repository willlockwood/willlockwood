The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit found for Duracraft, holding that Vornado had no protectable trade-dress rights in the grill design. See <i>Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. </i>v. <i>Duracraft Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/58/1498/">58 F.3d 1498</a> (1995) <i>(Vornado I).</i></p><p>Nevertheless, on November 26, 1999, respondent lodged a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission against petitioner, The Holmes Group, Inc., claiming that petitioner\'s sale of fans and heaters with a spiral grill design infringed respondent\'s patent and the same trade dress held unprotectable in <i>Vornado </i>1. Several weeks later, petitioner filed this action against respondent in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, seeking, <i>inter alia, </i>a declaratory judgment that its products did not infringe respondent\'s trade dress and an injunction restraining respondent from accusing it of trade-dress infringement in promotional materials. Respondent\'s answer asserted a compulsory counterclaim alleging patent infringement.</p><p>The District Court granted petitioner the declaratory judgment and injunction it sought. 93 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (Kan. 2000). The court explained that the collateralestoppel effect of <i>Vornado I </i>precluded respondent from relitigating its claim of trade-dress rights in the spiral grill design. It rejected respondent\'s contention that an intervening Federal Circuit case, <i>Midwest Industries, Inc. </i>v. <i>Karavan Trailers, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/175/1356/">175 F.3d 1356</a> (1999), which disagreed with the Tenth Circuit\'s reasoning in <i>Vornado </i>I, constituted a change in the law of trade dress that warranted relitigation of respondent\'s trade-dress claim. The court also stayed all proceedings related to respondent\'s counterclaim, adding that the counterclaim would be dismissed if the declaratory judgment and injunction entered in favor of petitioner were affirmed on appeal.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="829">829</a></p><p>Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Notwithstanding petitioner\'s challenge to its jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit vacated the District Court\'s judgment, 13 Fed.

S. 23</a> (2001), a case decided after the District Court\'s judgment which resolved a Circuit split involving <i>Vornado I </i>and <i>Midwest Industries. </i>We granted certiorari to consider whether the Federal Circuit properly asserted jurisdiction over the appeal. 534 U.

Section 1338(a), in turn, provides in relevant part that "[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents .... " Thus, the Federal Circuit\'s jurisdiction is fixed with reference to that of the district court, and turns on whether the action arises under federal patent law.1</p><p>Section 1338(a) uses the same operative language as 28 U.

N evertheless, those cases were decided on the principle that federal jurisdiction generally exists "only when a federal question is presented on the face of the <i>plaintiff\'s </i>properly pleaded complaint." <i>Caterpillar Inc. </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/386/case.html">482 U. S. 386</a>, 392 (1987) (emphasis added). As we said in <i>The Fair </i>v. <i>Kohler Die </i>&amp; <i>Specialty Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/22/case.html">228 U. S. 22</a>, 25 (1913), whether a case arises under federal patent law "cannot depend upon the answer." Moreover, we have declined to adopt proposals that "the answer as well as the complaint ... be consulted before a determination [is] made whether the case \'ar[ises] under\' federal law .... " <i>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. </i>v. <i>Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 </i>U. S. 1, 10-11, n. 9 (1983) (citing American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts \xc2\xa7 1312, pp. 188-194 (1969)). It follows that a counterclaim-which appears as part of the defendant\'s answer, not as part of the plaintiff\'s complaint-cannot serve as the basis for "arising under" jurisdiction. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>In re Adams, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/809/1187/">809 F.2d 1187</a>, 1188, n. 1 <i>(CAS </i>1987); <i>FDIC </i>v. <i>Elefant, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/790/661/">790 F.2d 661</a>, 667 <i>(CA7 </i>1986); <i>Takeda </i>v. <i>Northwestern National Life Ins.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3722, pp. 402-414 (3d ed. 1998).</p><p>Allowing a counterclaim to establish "arising under" jurisdiction would also contravene the longstanding policies underlying our precedents. First, since the plaintiff is "the master of the complaint," the well-pleaded-complaint rule enables him, "by eschewing claims based on federal law, ... to have the cause heard in state court." <i>Caterpillar Inc., supra, </i>at 398-399. The rule proposed by respondent, in contrast, would leave acceptance or rejection of a state forum to the master of the counterclaim. It would allow a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="832">832</a></p><p>defendant to remove a case brought in state court under state law, thereby defeating a plaintiff\'s choice of forum, simply by raising a federal counterclaim. Second, conferring this power upon the defendant would radically expand the class of removable cases, contrary to the "[d]ue regard for the rightful independence of state governments" that our cases addressing removal require. See <i>Shamrock Oil </i>&amp; <i>Gas Corp. </i>v. <i>Sheets, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/100/case.html">313 U. S. 100</a>, 109 (1941) (internal quotation marks omitted). And finally, allowing responsive pleadings by the defendant to establish "arising under" jurisdiction would undermine the clarity and ease of administration of the well-pleaded-complaint doctrine, which serves as a "quick rule of thumb" for resolving jurisdictional conflicts. See <i>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </i>at 11.</p><p>For these reasons, we decline to transform the longstanding well-pleaded-complaint rule into the "well-pleaded<i>complaint-or-counterclaim </i>rule" urged by respondent.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Respondent argues, in the alternative, that even if a counterclaim generally cannot establish the original "arising under" jurisdiction of a district court, we should interpret the phrase "arising under" differently in ascertaining the Federal Circuit\'s jurisdiction. In respondent\'s view, effectuating Congress\'s goal of "promoting the uniformity of patent law," Brief for Respondent 21, requires us to interpret \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) and 1338(a) to confer exclusive appellate jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit whenever a patent-law counterclaim is raised.3</p><p>3 Echoing a variant of this argument, JUSTICE GINSBURG contends that "giv[ing] effect" to Congress\'s intention "to eliminate forum shopping and to advance uniformity in ... patent law" requires that the Federal Circuit have exclusive jurisdiction whenever a patent claim was "actually adjudicated." <i>Post, </i>at 840 (opinion concurring in judgment). We rejected precisely this argument in <i>Christianson, </i>viz., the suggestion that the Federal</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="833">833</a></p><p>We do not think this option is available. Our task here is not to determine what would further Congress\'s goal of ensuring patent-law uniformity, but to determine what the words of the statute must fairly be understood to mean. It would be difficult enough to give "arising under" the meaning urged by respondent if that phrase appeared in \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1)-the jurisdiction-conferring <i>statute-itself </i>Cf. Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, \xc2\xa7 211(b)(2), 85 Stat. 749 (providing the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals "in cases and controversies arising under this title"). Even then the phrase would not be some neologism that might justify our adverting to the general purpose of the legislation, but rather a term familiar to all law students as invoking the wellpleaded-complaint rule. Cf. <i>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. </i>v. <i>New England Petroleum Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/604/179/">604 F.2d 179</a>, 183 <i>(CA2 </i>1979) ("The use of the phrase \'cases and controversies arising under\' ... is strong evidence that Congress intended to borrow the body of decisional law that has developed under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331 and other grants of jurisdiction to the district courts over cases \'arising under\' various regulatory statutes"). But the present case is even weaker than that, since \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) does not itself <i>use </i>the term, but rather refers to jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1338, where it is well established that "arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents" invokes, specifically, the well-pleaded-complaint rule. It would be an unprecedented feat of interpretive necromancy to say that \xc2\xa7 1338(a)\'s "arising under" language means one thing (the well-pleaded-complaint rule) in its own right,</p><p>Circuit\'s jurisdiction is "fixed \'by reference to the case actually litigated.\' " 486 U.

By limiting the Federal Circuit\'s jurisdiction to cases in which district courts would have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1338, Congress referred to a wellestablished body of law that requires courts to consider whether a patent-law claim appears on the face of the plaintiff\'s well-pleaded complaint. Because petitioner\'s complaint did not include any claim based on patent law, we vacate the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remand the case with instructions to transfer the case to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See 28 U. S.

See <i>post, </i>at 835 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). There is not. The cases relied upon by JUSTICE STEVENS and by the court in <i>Aerojet-General Corp. </i>v. <i>Machine Tool Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle Ltd., 895 </i>F. 2d 736 <i>(CA </i>Fed. 1990), simply address whether a district court can retain jurisdiction over a counterclaim if the complaint (or a claim therein) is dismissed or if a jurisdictional defect in the complaint is identified. They do not even mention the well-pleaded-complaint rule that the statutory phrase "arising under" invokes. Nor do any of these cases interpret \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) or another statute conferring appellate jurisdiction with reference to the jurisdiction of the district court. Thus, the cases relied upon by JUSTICE STEVENS have no bearing on whether the phrase "arising under" can be interpreted differently in ascertaining the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit than that of the district court.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="835">835</a></p><p>cases is "fixed with reference to that of the district court," <i>ante, </i>at 829.

See <i>Griggs </i>v. <i>Provident Consumer Discount Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/56/case.html">459 U. S. 56</a>, 58-59 (1982) <i>(per curiam) </i>("The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance-it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal").</p><p>Thus, if a case began as an antitrust case, but an amendment to the complaint added a patent claim that was pending or was decided when the appeal is taken, the jurisdiction of the district court would have been based "in part" on 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1338(a), and therefore \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) would grant the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over the appeal. Conversely, if the only patent count in a multicount complaint was voluntarily dismissed in advance of trial, it would seem equally clear that the appeal should be taken to the appropriate regional court of appeals rather than to the Federal Circuit. See <i>Christianson </i>v. <i>Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 </i>U. S. 800, 823-824 (1988) (STEVENS, J., concurring). Any other approach "would enable an unscrupulous plaintiff to manipulate appellate court jurisdiction by the timing of the amendments to its complaint." <i>Id., </i>at 824. To the extent that the Court\'s opinion might be read as endorsing a contrary result by reason of its reliance on cases involving the removal jurisdiction of the district court, I do not agree with it.</p><p>I also do not agree with the Court\'s statement that an interpretation of the "in whole or in part" language of \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) to encompass patent claims alleged in a compulsory counterclaim providing an independent basis for the district court\'s jurisdiction would be a "neologism" that would involve "an unprecedented feat of interpretive necromancy," <i>ante, </i>at 833.

But surely it is not a "quibbl[e]" to acknowledge them as supporting the <i>Aerojet </i>court\'s conclusion that the jurisdiction of the district court can be based on a patent counterclaim, thereby satisfying the "in whole or in part" requirement of \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1).</p><p>In any event, the assertion that only the power of black magic could give "arising under" a different meaning with respect to appellate jurisdiction is belied by case law involving the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals (TECA), which had exclusive jurisdiction over appeals in cases "arising under" the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 (ESA), \xc2\xa7 211(b)(2), 85 Stat. 749. Most courts departed from the traditional understanding of "arising under" and interpreted the statute to grant TECA appellate jurisdiction over ESA issues, including those raised as a defense. Courts nevertheless interpreted the statute\'s identical language respecting the district courts to grant traditional "arising under" jurisdiction. See <i>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. </i>v. <i>New England Petroleum Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/604/179/">604 F.2d 179</a>, 185-186 <i>(CA2 </i>1979) ("It must be candidly recognized that according the TECA some form of \'issue\' jurisdiction places on the phrase, \'cases and controversies arising under,\' ... a construction that differs from the meaning associated with these words in other jurisdictional statutes, and differs even from the grant of jurisdiction to the district courts in [the ESA]"). Thus, although I am in agreement with the Court\'s ultimate decision not to determine appellate jurisdiction by reference to the defendant\'s patent counterclaim, I find it unnecessary and inappropriate to slight the contrary reasoning of the Court of Appeals.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="837">837</a></p><p>plaintiff. In my judgment, each of the three policies that the Court has identified as supporting the "well-pleadedcomplaint" rule governing district court jurisdiction, <i>ante, </i>at 831-832, points in the same direction with respect to appellate jurisdiction.</p><p>First, the interest in preserving the plaintiff\'s choice of forum includes not only the court that will conduct the trial but the appellate court as well. A plaintiff who has a legitimate interest in litigating in a circuit whose precedents support its theory of the case might omit a patent claim in order to avoid review in the Federal Circuit. In some cases that interest would be defeated by a rule that allowed a patent counterclaim to determine the appellate forum.</p><p>Second, although I doubt that a rule that enabled the counterclaimant to be the occasional master of the appellate forum "would radically expand" the number of cases heard by the Federal Circuit, <i>ante, </i>at 832, we must recognize that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit defined in \xc2\xa7 1295(a)(1) does not comprise claims arising under the trademark and copyright laws, which are included in the district court\'s grant of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1338(a).2 As the instant litigation demonstrates, claims sounding in these other areas of intellectual property law are not infrequently bound up with patent counterclaims. The potential number of cases in which a counterclaim might direct to the Federal Circuit appeals that Congress specifically chose not to place within its exclusive jurisdiction is therefore significant.</p><p>Third, the interest in maintaining clarity and simplicity in rules governing appellate jurisdiction will be served by lim-</p><p>2 The statute grants the Federal Circuit "exclusive jurisdiction ... if the jurisdiction of [the district] court was based, in whole or in part, on [28 U. S. <i>C.] </i>section 1338 ... , except that a case involving a claim arising under any Act of Congress relating to copyrights, exclusive rights in mask works, or trademarks and no other claims under section 1338(a) shall be governed" by provisions relating to appeals to the regional courts of appeals. 28 U.

In his opinion in <i>Aerojet, </i>Chief Judge Markey merely held that a counterclaim for patent infringement that was "compulsory" and not "frivolous" or "insubstantial" sufficed to establish jurisdiction; he made a point of noting that there was no assertion in the case that the patent counterclaim at issue had been filed "to manipulate the jurisdiction of [the Federal Circuit]." 895 F. 2d, at 738. The text of the statute, however, would not seem to distinguish between that counterclaim and those that are permissive, insubstantial, or manipulative, and there is very good reason not to make the choice of appellate forum turn on such distinctions. Requiring assessment of a defendant\'s motive in raising a patent counterclaim or the counterclaim\'s relative strength wastes judicial resources by inviting "unhappy interactions between jurisdiction and the merits." <i>Kennedy</i></p><p>There is, of course, a countervailing interest in directing appeals in patent cases to the specialized court that was created, in part, to promote uniformity in the development of this area of the law. But we have already decided that the Federal Circuit does not have exclusive jurisdiction over all cases raising patent issues.3 <i>Christianson, </i>486 U.

See <i>id., </i>at 741-744 (distinguishing <i>Christianson </i>v. <i>Colt Industries Operating Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/800/case.html">486 U.
