Reg. 53057 (2001).  It \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically interprets [\xc2\xa72607(b)] as not being limited to situations where at least two persons split or share an unearned fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  More broadly, the policy statement construes \xc2\xa72607(b) as authority for regulation of the charges paid by consumers for the provision of settlements.  It says that \xe2\x80\x9ca settlement service provider may not mark-up the cost of another provider\xe2\x80\x99s services without providing additional settlement services; such payment must be for services that are actual, necessary and distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 53059.  Moreover, in addition to facing liability when it collects a fee that is entirely unearned, a provider may also \xe2\x80\x9cbe liable under [\xc2\xa72607(b)] when it charges a fee that exceeds the reason-able value of goods, facilities, or services provided,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., on the theory that the excess over reasonable value constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d of the charge \xe2\x80\x9cother than for services actually performed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72607(b).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe last mentioned point, however, is manifestly in-consistent with the statute HUD purported to construe.  When Congress enacted RESPA in 1974, it included a directive that HUD make a report to Congress within five years regarding the need for further legislation in the area.  See \xc2\xa72612(a) (1976 ed.).  Among the topics required to be included in the report were \xe2\x80\x9crecommendations on whether Federal regulation of the charges for real estate settlement services in federally related mortgage transactions is necessary and desirable,\xe2\x80\x9d and, if so, recommendations with regard to what reforms should be adopted.  \xc2\xa72612(b)(2).  The directive for recommendations regarding the desirability of price regulation would make no sense if Congress had already resolved the issue\xe2\x80\x94if \xc2\xa72607(b) already carried with it authority for HUD to proscribe the collection of unreasonably high fees for settlement services, i.e., to engage in price regulation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNo doubt recognizing as much, petitioners do not fully adopt HUD\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa72607(b).  Noting that even those Courts of Appeals which have found \xc2\xa72607(b) not to be limited to fee-splitting situations have held that the statute does not reach unreasonably high fees, see Kruse v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., 383 F. 3d 49, 56 (CA2 2004); Santiago v. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., 417 F.\xc2\xa03d 384, 387 (CA3 2005); Friedman v.

They nonetheless embrace HUD\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa72607(b) insofar as it holds that a provider violates the statute by retaining a fee after providing no services at all in return.  In short, petitioners contend that, by allegedly charg- ing each of them an unearned fee, respondent \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage\xe2\x80\x9d of a settlement, service charge (i.e., 100 percent of the charge) \xe2\x80\x9cother than for services actually performed.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72607(b) (2006 ed.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties vigorously dispute whether the position set forth in HUD\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 policy statement should be accorded deference under the framework announced by this Court in Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

That provider then \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and another person \xe2\x80\x9caccept[s],\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage\xe2\x80\x9d of the charge.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of different sets of verbs, with distinct tenses, to distinguish between the consumer-provider transaction (the \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cmade or received\xe2\x80\x9d) and the fee-sharing transaction (the \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cgive[n]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d) would be pointless if, as petitioners contend, the two transactions could be collapsed into one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners try to merge the two stages by arguing that a settlement-service provider can \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a charge (stage one) and then \xe2\x80\x9caccept\xe2\x80\x9d (stage two) the portion of the charge consisting of 100 percent.

And who \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the portion of the charge consisting of 100 percent?  The same provider who \xe2\x80\x9caccept[s]\xe2\x80\x9d it?  This reading does not avoid collapsing the sequential relationship of the two stages, and it would simply destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two (i.e., a giving and accepting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners seek to avoid this consequence, at stage two at least, by saying that the consumer is the person who \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage\xe2\x80\x9d of the charge to the provider who \xe2\x80\x9caccept[s]\xe2\x80\x9d it.  See Brief for Petitioners 21; Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.  But since under this statute it is (so to speak) as accursed to give as to receive, this would make lawbreakers of consumers\xe2\x80\x94the very class for whose benefit \xc2\xa72607(b) was enacted, see \xc2\xa72601.  It is no answer to say that a consumer would not face damages liability because a violator is liable only \xe2\x80\x9cto the person or persons charged for the settlement service,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72607(d)(2), and it would not make sense to render a consumer liable to himself.  It is the logical consequence that a consumer would be liable to himself, not the specter of actual damages liability, which provides strong indication that something in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation is amiss.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt any rate, \xc2\xa72607(b) is also enforceable through criminal prosecutions, \xc2\xa72607(d)(1), and actions for injunctive relief brought by federal and state regulators, \xc2\xa72607(d)(4).  HUD\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 policy statement asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cHUD is, of course, unlikely to direct any enforcement actions against consumers for the payment of unearned fees,\xe2\x80\x9d 66 Fed. Reg. 53059, n.\xc2\xa06, but that assurance is cold comfort.  Moreover, even assuming (as seems realistic) that the Justice Department would be similarly reluctant to prosecute consumers for criminal violations of \xc2\xa72607(b), \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutorial discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to criminal statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abuelhawa v.

United States, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600, \n605 (1994)\n.  If that would excuse only those consumers who are unaware that they are paying for unearned services, some consumers would remain criminally liable\xe2\x80\x94those who know that the fee is unearned but decide to pay it anyway, perhaps because the provider\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is still the best deal.  And if it would immunize all consumers, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s criminalization of the entire \xe2\x80\x9cgiving\xe2\x80\x9d portion of consumer-provider transactions would make little sense.  We find it virtually unthinkable that Congress would leave it to imputed mens rea to preserve from criminal liability some or all of the class RESPA was designed to protect\xe2\x80\x94and entirely unthinkable that Congress would have created that strange disposition through language as obscure as that relied upon here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage\xe2\x80\x9d reinforces the conclusion that \xc2\xa72607(b) does not cover a situation in which a settlement-service provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer.  It is certainly true that \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpercentage\xe2\x80\x9d can be used to include the entirety, or 100 percent.  See, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7648 (\xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d); \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78348(g) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (\xe2\x80\x9cpercentag[e]\xe2\x80\x9d); \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78351(b)(2)(B) (2006 ed.) (same); \n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71467a(m)(7)(B)(ii)(II) (same).  But that is not the normal meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d when one speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d a portion of the whole, as dictionary definitions uniformly show.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Aesop\xe2\x80\x99s fable would be just as wryly humorous if the lion\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the entirety of the kill he hunted in partnership with less ferocious animals had been translated into English as the \xe2\x80\x9clion\xe2\x80\x99s portion\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share.  As for \xe2\x80\x9cpercentage,\xe2\x80\x9d that word can include 100 percent\xe2\x80\x94or even 300 percent\xe2\x80\x94when it refers to merely a ratable measure (\xe2\x80\x9cunemployment claims were up 300 percent\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But, like \xe2\x80\x9cportion,\xe2\x80\x9d it normally means less than all when referring to a \xe2\x80\x9cpercentage\xe2\x80\x9d of a specific whole (\xe2\x80\x9che demanded a percentage of the profits\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And it is normal usage that, in the absence of contrary indication, governs our interpretation of texts.

For \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpercentage\xe2\x80\x9d do not stand in isolation, but are part of a phrase in which they are joined together by the intervening word \xe2\x80\x9csplit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, as petitioners acknowledge, Brief for Petitioners 19, cannot possibly mean the entirety.  We think it clear that, in employing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cportion, split, or percentage,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress sought to invoke the words\xe2\x80\x99 common \xe2\x80\x9ccore of meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.

Petitioners rightly point out that under our interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cportion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csplit,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpercentage\xe2\x80\x9d all mean the same thing\xe2\x80\x94a perhaps regrettable but not uncommon sort of lawyerly iteration (\xe2\x80\x9cgive, grant, bargain, sell, and convey\xe2\x80\x9d).

Brief for Petitioners 24.  Not so.  Section 2607(a) prohibits giving or accepting \xe2\x80\x9cany fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be referred to any person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72607(a).  That prohibition is at once broader than \xc2\xa72607(b)\xe2\x80\x99s (because it applies to the transfer of any \xe2\x80\x9cthing of value,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to the dividing of a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d paid by a consumer) and narrower (because it requires an \xe2\x80\x9cagreement or understanding\xe2\x80\x9d to refer business).  Thus, a settlement-service provider who agrees to exchange valuable tickets to a sporting event in return for a referral of business would violate \xc2\xa72607(a), but not \xc2\xa72607(b).  So too a provider who agrees to pay a monetary referral fee that is not tied in any respect to a charge paid by a particular consumer\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a \xe2\x80\x9cretainer\xe2\x80\x9d agreement pursuant to which the provider pays a monthly lump sum in exchange for the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to refer any business that comes his way.  By contrast, a settlement-service provider who gives a portion of a charge to another person who has not rendered any services in return would violate \xc2\xa72607(b), even if an express referral arrangement does not exist or cannot be shown.  In short, each subsection reaches conduct that the other does not; there is no need to adopt petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 improbable reading of \xc2\xa72607(b) to avoid rendering any portion of \xc2\xa72607 superfluous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt follows that petitioners can derive no support from \xc2\xa72607\xe2\x80\x99s caption: \xe2\x80\x9cProhibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsection (a) prohibits certain kickbacks (those agreed to in exchange for referrals) and subsection (b) prohibits certain unearned fees (those paid from a part of the charge to the customer).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners also appeal to statutory purpose, arguing that a prohibition against the charging of undivided unearned fees would fit comfortably with RESPA\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal of \xe2\x80\x9cinsur[ing] that consumers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72601(a).

RESPA\xe2\x80\x99s particular language ultimately serves to drive home a broader point:  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,\xe2\x80\x9d  Rodriguez v.

That result does not strike us as particularly anomalous.  Congress may well have concluded that existing remedies, such as state-law fraud actions, were sufficient to deal with the problem of entirely fictitious fees, whereas legislative action was required to deal with the problems posed by kickbacks and fee splitting.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the statute leads to an \xe2\x80\x9cabsurdity\xe2\x80\x9d of its own: Because \xc2\xa72607(b) manifestly cannot be understood to prohibit unreasonably high fees, see supra, at 5, a service provider could avoid liability by providing just a dollar\xe2\x80\x99s worth of services in exchange for the $1,000 fee.  Acknowledging that \xc2\xa72607(b)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is limited to fee-splitting transactions at least has the virtue of making it a coherent response to that particular problem, rather than an incoherent response to the broader problem of unreasonably high fees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn order to establish a violation of \xc2\xa72607(b), a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons.

But Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use ofthe singular \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d does not remotely establish that \xc2\xa72607(b) can be violated by a single culpable actor who accepts an unearned charge from a consumer.  In fact, any such inference is negated by the history of \xc2\xa72607.  When RESPA was first enacted, \xc2\xa72607(d) separately provided for damages liability of \xe2\x80\x9cany person or persons who violate the provisions of subsection (a)\xe2\x80\x9d and of \xe2\x80\x9cany person or persons who violate the provisions of subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72607(d)(2) (1976 ed.).  Because \xc2\xa72607(a), with its reference to an \xe2\x80\x9cagreement or understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d has always required two culpable parties for a violation, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany person or persons\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with that subsection demonstrates that the phrase does not have the significance attributed to it by the United States.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
