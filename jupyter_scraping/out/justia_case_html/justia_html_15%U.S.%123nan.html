JUSTICE JOHNSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the facts stated in this appeal make a clear case of tortious dispossession on the part of the <em>Paul Jones.</em>  The privateer <em>Cadet</em> had, with great gallantry, captured the <em>Mary</em> and been in possession of her part of a night and day.  The prize was close in upon the American coast, and making for a port which was open before her.  It was not until the superior sailing of the <em>Paul Jones</em> made it manifest that the prize must be cut off from this port and until she had been repeatedly fired upon that the prize crew abandoned her.  There exists not a pretext in the case that this abandonment was voluntary or would have taken place but for the hostile approach of the <em>Paul Jones.</em>  Whether the <em>vis major</em> acted upon the force or the fears of the prize crew is immaterial, since actual dispossession ensued.</p>\n<p>But it is argued that the <em>Paul Jones</em> showed American colors; the <em>Mary</em> ought not therefore to have feared her; the <em>Mary</em> showed no colors, she therefore invited pursuit; and finally that the <em>Paul Jones</em> found her in the actual possession of her </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 15 U. S. 131</a></p><p> original master, and therefore could not have done otherwise than detain her.</p>\n<p>We think otherwise.  It was more probable that an enemy would show false than true colors.  The circumstance of the <em>Mary\'s</em> standing in for a friendly shore was less equivocal evidence of her character than the exhibition of colors, and after boarding the <em>Mary</em> and learning that she was a prize to the <em>Cadet,</em> it was the duty of the captor to have repaired the injury he had done, and, either by making signals, sending a boat on shore, or a message by the boat that did come off, to have recalled the prize crew of the <em>Cadet.</em>  But instead of this, she instantly mans the prize, bears away from the harbor, which was close under their lee, and, by carrying English colors until out of sight, completes the conviction of the prize crew that the recapture was by an enemy.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the decision of the circuit and district courts should be reversed, that the prize should be adjudged to the <em>Cadet,</em> and the case remanded for the assessment of reasonable damages in favor of the <em>Cadet.</em>  But considering that the prize arrived in safety and probably in a more secure harbor than that for which she was sailing when seized by the <em>Paul Jones</em> (although it is certainly a case for damages), we are of opinion the damages should be moderate.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
