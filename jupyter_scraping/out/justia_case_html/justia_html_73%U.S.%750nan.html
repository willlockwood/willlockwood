JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Company, by virtue of its charter and the proceedings under it, acquired a title in fee to the roadbed, and the rolling stock owned by it, and used and employed in connection with the road, is made a fixture by an express statute of the State of Wisconsin, and such, we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 73 U. S. 752</a></p><p> think, is the law according to the true construction of the charter, independent of the statute. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  By the statute law of Wisconsin, judgments are liens on real estate, and we do not doubt but that this judgment became a lien on the road from the time of its rendition, and that a sale under a decree in chancery, and conveyance in pursuance thereof, confirmed by the court, passed the whole of the interest of the company existing at the time of its rendition to the purchaser.
