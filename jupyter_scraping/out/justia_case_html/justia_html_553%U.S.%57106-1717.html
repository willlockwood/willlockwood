CHERTOFF, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931717.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 19, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 2, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">After prevailing against the Government on a claim originating in the Department of Transportation\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Contract Appeals, petitioner (Richlin) filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, expenses, and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  The Board concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that Richlin was not entitled to recover paralegal fees at the rates at which it was billed by its law firm, holding that EAJA limited such recovery to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s cost, which was lower than the billed rate.  In affirming, the Federal Circuit concluded that the term \xe2\x80\x9cfees,\xe2\x80\x9d for which EAJA authorizes recovery at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d embraces only the fees of attorneys, experts, and agents.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A prevailing party that satisfies EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0EAJA permits a prevailing party to recover \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with\xe2\x80\x9d administrative proceedings, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(a)(1), including \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project \xe2\x80\xa6 , and reasonable attorney or agent fees,\xe2\x80\x9d and bases the amount of such fees on \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A).  Because Richlin \xe2\x80\x9cincurred\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d for paralegal services in connection with its action before the Board, a straightforward reading of the statute demonstrates that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading\xe2\x80\x94that expenditures for paralegal services are \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d recoverable only at \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is unpersuasive.  Section 504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between the rates at which \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d are reimbursed.  Even if the statutory text supported the Government\xe2\x80\x99s dichotomy, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d rather than as \xe2\x80\x9cfees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Paralegals are surely more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects.  Even if the Court agreed that EAJA limited paralegal fees to \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost,\xe2\x80\x9d it would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney rather than the client.  By providing that an agency shall award a prevailing party \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>incurred by that party\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (emphasis added), \xc2\xa7504(a)(1) leaves no doubt that Congress intended the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s items to be calculated from the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s perspective.  It is unlikely that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from their employer\xe2\x80\x99s perspective.  It seems more plausible that Congress intended all \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses\xe2\x80\x9d to be recoverable at the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the proviso that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d would be deemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates\xe2\x80\x9d when such rates could be determined.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, this Court need look no further to resolve it than <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/274/index.html">491 U. S. 274</a>, where the Court addressed a similar question with respect to the Civil Rights Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Fees Awards Act of 1976\xe2\x80\x94which provides that a court \xe2\x80\x9cmay allow the prevailing party \xe2\x80\xa6 a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x94finding it \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys, 491 U. S., at 285.  EAJA, like \xc2\xa71988, entitles certain parties to recover \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney \xe2\x80\xa6 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A), and makes no mention of the paralegals, \xe2\x80\x9csecretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client,\xe2\x80\x9d 491 U. S., at 285.  Thus, EAJA, like \xc2\xa71988, must be interpreted as using the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney \xe2\x80\xa6 fees\xe2\x80\x9d to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s personal labor, making \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended that term to embrace paralegal fees.  Since \xc2\xa7504 generally provides for recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d it follows that paralegal fees must also be recoverable at those rates.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>Jenkins</em> found paralegal fees recoverable as \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d because \xc2\xa71988 authorized no other recoverable \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d finds no support in <em>Jenkins </em>itself<em>,</em> which turned not on extratextual policy goals, but on the \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d had historically included paralegal fees.  Indeed, this Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Jenkins</em> in <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/83/index.html">499 U. S. 83</a>, concluding that a petitioner seeking expert witness fees under \xc2\xa71988 could not rely on <em>Jenkins</em> for the proposition that \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbroad remedial purposes\xe2\x80\x9d allowed recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(a)(l) (2006 ed.) and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) (2000 ed.), allows a prevailing party in a case brought by or against the Government to recover fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services or only at their cost to the party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit limited recovery to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s cost.  472 F.\xc2\xa03d 1370 (2006).  We reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Richlin Security Service Co. (Richlin) is a small California proprietorship.  In the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, it was engaged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to provide guard services for detainees at Los Angeles International Airport.  Through mutual mistake, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 two contracts misclassified Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s employees under the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7351 <em>et seq.</em>  The Department of Labor discovered the misclassification and ordered Richlin to pay its employees back wages.  Richlin responded by filing a claim against the Government with the Department of Transportation\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Contract Appeals (Board).  The claim sought reformation of the two contracts in order to force the Government to make additional payments necessary to cover Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s liability under the Service Contract Act.  Richlin prevailed after extensive litigation, and the Board entered an award in its favor.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Richlin then filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of its attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to EAJA.  Under EAJA, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(a)(1).  In addition to its other fees and expenses, Richlin sought $45,141.10 for 523.8\xc2\xa0hours of paralegal work on its contract claim and $6,760 for 68.2\xc2\xa0hours of paralegal work on the EAJA application itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board granted Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s application in part.  <em>Richlin Security Service Co.</em> v. <em>Department of Justice</em>, Nos.\xc2\xa0WRO\xe2\x80\x9306\xe2\x80\x9390, WRO\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x9391, 2005 WL 1635099 (June\xc2\xa030, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a.  It found that Richlin met \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility requirements, see <em>id.,</em> at 30a, and that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position had not been \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7504(a)(1), <em>id.,</em> at 32a.  It concluded, however, that Richlin was not entitled to recover its paralegal fees at the rates (ranging from $50\xc2\xa0per hour to $95\xc2\xa0per hour) at which Richlin was billed by its law firm.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See <em>id</em>.<em>,</em> at 39a.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(a)(1).  EAJA defines \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses\xe2\x80\x9d as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[F]ees and other expenses\xe2\x80\x99 includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the agency to be necessary for the preparation of the party\xe2\x80\x99s case, and reasonable attorney or agent fees (The amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that (i)\xc2\xa0no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the agency involved, and (ii)\xc2\xa0attorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.)\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn this case, Richlin \xe2\x80\x9cincurred\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d for paralegal services in connection with its contract action before the Board.  Since \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) awards fees at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d a straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government resists this reading by distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d are reimbursable at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d but it insists that \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d (including expenses for \xe2\x80\x9cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\xe2\x80\x9d) are reimbursable only at their \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, outlays for paralegal services are better characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d than as \xe2\x80\x9cfees.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government observes that the second sentence of \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A), which explains how to calculate awards for \xe2\x80\x9cfees,\xe2\x80\x9d refers to attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, without mentioning paralegals.  From this omission, the Government infers that Congress intended to treat expenditures for paralegal services not as \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d but as \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d recoverable at \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fractured interpretation of the statute unpersuasive.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention, \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between the rates at which \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d are reimbursed.  Although the statute does refer to the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress may reasonably have believed that market rates would not exist for work product of that kind.  At one point, Congress even appears to use the terms \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably: The first clause of \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) refers to the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expenses of expert witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d while the parenthetical characterizes expert compensation as \xe2\x80\x9cfees.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no indication that Congress, in using the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d in one place and \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d in the other, was referring to two different components of expert remuneration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the dichotomy that the Government draws between \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother expenses\xe2\x80\x9d were supported by the statutory text, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d rather than as \xe2\x80\x9cfees.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government concludes that the omission of paralegal fees from \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s parenthetical (which generally authorizes reimbursement at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates\xe2\x80\x9d) implies that the recovery of paralegal fees is limited to cost.  But one could just as easily conclude that the omission of paralegal fees from the litany of \xe2\x80\x9cany study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project\xe2\x80\x9d (all of which are recoverable at \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d) implies that paralegal fees are recoverable at market rates.  Surely paralegals are more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects.  Even the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, which incants the term \xe2\x80\x9cparalegal expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondent 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, slips up once and refers to them as \xe2\x80\x9cfees,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>id.,</em> at 35 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs the court of appeals explained, treating paralegal fees as attorney fees could \xe2\x80\x98distort the normal allocation of work and result in a less efficient performance of legal services\xe2\x80\x99 under the EAJA \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if we agreed that EAJA limited a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s recovery for paralegal fees to \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost,\xe2\x80\x9d it certainly would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To the contrary, it would be anomalous to measure cost from the perspective of the attorney rather than the client.  We do not understand the Government to contend, for example, that the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cengineering report\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canalysis\xe2\x80\x9d should be calculated from the perspective of the firm that employs the engineer or analyst.  Such an interpretation would be tough to square with the statutory language.  Section\xc2\xa0504(a)(1) provides that an agency shall award to a prevailing party \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses <em>incurred by that party</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  That language leaves no doubt that Congress intended the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d of the specified items in \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) to be calculated from the perspective of the litigant.  That being the case, we find it hard to believe that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from the perspective of their employer rather than the litigant.  It seems more plausible that Congress intended all \xe2\x80\x9cfees and other expenses\xe2\x80\x9d to be recoverable at the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the proviso that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable cost\xe2\x80\x9d would be deemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates\xe2\x80\x9d when such rates could be determined.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, we need not look far to resolve it, for we have already addressed a similar question with respect to another fee-shifting statute.  In <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/274/index.html"></a><a href="/us/491/274/index.html">491 U. S. 274</a> (1989), we considered whether litigants could recover paralegal fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988.  Section\xc2\xa01988 provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  We concluded that the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71988 \xe2\x80\x9ccannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the bar.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em> 491 U.

Although separate billing for paralegals had become \xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly widespread,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted), attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees had traditionally subsumed both the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s personal labor and the labor of paralegals and other individuals who contributed to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s work product, see <em>id.,</em> at 285.  We were so confident that Congress had given the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d this traditional gloss that we declared it \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that the term embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think Jenkins</em> substantially answers the question before us.  EAJA, like \xc2\xa71988, entitles certain parties to recover \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney \xe2\x80\xa6 fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A).  EAJA, like \xc2\xa71988, makes no mention of the paralegals, \xe2\x80\x9csecretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 285.  And we think EAJA, like \xc2\xa71988, must be interpreted as using the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney \xe2\x80\xa6 fees\xe2\x80\x9d to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s personal labor.  The Government does not contend that the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d changed so much between \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1976 and EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1980 that the term\xe2\x80\x99s meaning in one statute must be different from its meaning in the other.  Under the reasoning of <em>Jenkins</em>, we take it as \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d that when Congress instructed agencies to award \xe2\x80\x9cattorney \xe2\x80\xa6 fees\xe2\x80\x9d to certain parties prevailing against the Government, that term was intended to embrace paralegal fees as well.  Since \xc2\xa7504 generally provides for recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates,\xe2\x80\x9d it follows that fees for paralegal services must be recoverable at prevailing market rates as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that our decision in <em>Jenkins</em> was driven by considerations arising from the different context in which the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d was used in \xc2\xa71988.  At the time <em>Jenkins</em> was decided, \xc2\xa71988 provided for the recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees without reference to any other recoverable \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government insists that <em>Jenkins</em> found paralegal fees recoverable under the guise of \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d because otherwise paralegal fees would not be recoverable at all.  Since EAJA expressly permits recovery (albeit at \xe2\x80\x9ccost\xe2\x80\x9d) for items other than attorney, agent, and expert witness fees, the Government sees no reason to give EAJA the broad construction that <em>Jenkins</em> gave \xc2\xa71988.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for distinguishing <em>Jenkins</em> finds no support either in our opinion there or in our subsequent decisions.  Our opinion in <em>Jenkins</em> expressed no apprehension at the possibility that a contrary decision would leave the claimant emptyhanded.  This omission is unsurprising, since our decision in <em>Jenkins</em> did not rest on the conviction that recovery at market rates was better than nothing.  Our decision rested instead on the proposition\xe2\x80\x94a proposition we took as \xe2\x80\x9cself-evident\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d had historically included fees for paralegal services.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Jenkins</em> was rejected by this Court just two years after <em>Jenkins</em> was handed down.  In <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/83/index.html">499 U. S. 83</a>, the petitioner sought to recover expert witness fees from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to \xc2\xa71988.  The petitioner looked to <em>Jenkins</em> for the proposition that the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad remedial purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71988 allowed the recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute.  The Court rejected that interpretation of <em>Jenkins:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe issue [in Jenkins</em>] was not, as [petitioner] contends, whether we would permit our perception of the \xe2\x80\x98policy\xe2\x80\x99 of the statute to overcome its \xe2\x80\x98plain language.\xe2\x80\x99  It was not remotely plain in <em>Jenkins</em> that the phrase \xe2\x80\x98attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x99 did not include charges for law clerk and paralegal services.  Such services, like the services of \xe2\x80\x98secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product,\xe2\x80\x99 had traditionally been included in calculation of the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 hourly rates.  Only recently had there arisen \xe2\x80\x98the increasingly widespread custom of separately billing for [such] services.\xe2\x80\x99  By contrast, there has never been, to our knowledge, a practice of including the cost of expert services within attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 hourly rates.  There was also no record in <em>Jenkins</em>\xe2\x80\x94as there is a lengthy record here\xe2\x80\x94of statutory usage that recognizes a distinction between the charges at issue and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Casey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 99 (quoting 491 U. S., at 285\xe2\x80\x93286) (some internal quotation marks and citations omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nOur analysis of <em>Jenkins</em> in <em>Casey</em> refutes the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that <em>Jenkins</em> had to stretch the law to fit hard facts.  As <em>Casey</em> shows, our decision in <em>Jenkins</em> turned not on extratextual policy goals but on the traditional meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government parries this textual and doctrinal analysis with legislative history and public policy.  We are not persuaded by either.  The legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented, and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends first that a 1984 Senate Report accompanying the bill that reenacted EAJA[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] unequivocally expressed congressional intent that paralegal fees should be recovered only <em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98at cost</em>.<em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  Brief for Respondent 29 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 15; emphasis in original).  It next contends that the Report tacitly endorsed the same result by approving model rules of the Administrative Conference of the United States and a pre-EAJA Sixth Circuit decision, both of which had adopted schemes of reimbursement at attorney cost.  See Brief for Respondent 29<em>.</em>  We are not persuaded.  In our view, the legislative history does not even address the question presented, much less answer it in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Senate Report accompanying the 1984 bill remarked that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xamples of the type of expenses that should ordinarily be compensable [under EAJA] include paralegal time (billed at cost).\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 15.  The Government concludes from this stray remark that Congress intended to limit recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost.  But as we observed earlier, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccost\xe2\x80\x9d could just as easily (and more sensibly) refer to the client\xe2\x80\x99s cost rather than the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s cost.  Under the former interpretation, the Senate Report simply indicates that a prevailing party who satisfies EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s other requirements should generally be able to \xe2\x80\x9cbil[l]\xe2\x80\x9d the Government for any reasonable amount the party paid for paralegal services.  Since the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-pocket cost for paralegal services would normally be equal to the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d for such services, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A), the Senate Report could easily support Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccost\xe2\x80\x9d is correct, that interpretation would not be inconsistent with our decision today.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in [EAJA] requires that the work of paralegals invariably be billed separately.  If it is the practice in the relevant market not to do so, or to bill the work of paralegals only at cost, that is all that [EAJA] requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 288 (construing 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988).  We thus recognize the possibility, as we did in <em>Jenkins</em>, that the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s cost for paralegal services will supply the relevant metric for calculating the client\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.  Whether that metric is appropriate depends on market practice.  The Senate Report, even under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contestable interpretation, is not inconsistent with that conclusion.  On the contrary, the Report implies that courts should look to market practice in setting EAJA awards.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Act should not be read \xe2\x80\xa6 to permit reimbursement for items <em>ordinarily</em> included in office overhead, nor for any other expenses not reasonable in amount, necessary for the conduct of the litigation, <em>and customarily chargeable to clients</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Beyond that vague guidance, the Report does not address the critical question in this case: whether EAJA limits recovery of paralegal fees to attorney cost <em>regardless of market practice</em>.  As such, the Report does not persuade us of the soundness of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Northcross</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of the Memphis City Schools</em>, 611 F.\xc2\xa02d 624 (1979), founders for the same reason.  The Government contends that <em>Northcross</em> approved of reimbursement at attorney cost under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 and that the 1984 Senate Report, by endorsing <em>Northcross</em>, tacitly approved of the same result for EAJA.  See Brief for Respondent 30 (citing <em>Northcross</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 639).  The problem again is that <em>Northcross</em> did not decide whether a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s recovery for paralegal services would be limited to his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s cost even in a market where litigants were customarily billed at \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the Sixth Circuit seems to have been aware that paralegal services could be billed to clients at market rates, some language in its opinion suggests that the court assumed that attorneys billed their clients only for the out-of-pocket cost of paralegal services.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Since <em>Northcross</em> does not clearly address the question presented, its endorsement in the Senate Report means little.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the model rules cited in the Senate Report may actually support Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The implementing release for the rules describes the Administrative Conference\xe2\x80\x99s approach to paralegal costs as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCommenters also took varying positions on whether paralegal costs should be chargeable as expenses.  We do not believe the rules should discourage the use of paralegals, which can be an important cost-saving measure.  On the other hand, lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 practices with respect to charging for paralegal time, as with respect to other expenses such as duplicating, telephone charges and the like, vary according to locality, field of practice, and individual custom.  We have decided not to designate specific items as compensable expenses.  Instead, we will adopt a suggestion of the Treasury Department and revise the model rule to provide that expenses may be charged as a separate item if they are ordinarily so charged to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s clients.\xe2\x80\x9d  Administrative Conference of the U. S., Equal Access to Justice Act: Agency Implementation, 46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (1981).</p>\n<p align="left">\nTo the extent that this passage addresses the question presented at all, it seems to take the same approach that the Court took in <em>Jenkins</em> and that we adopt today: it allows the recovery of paralegal fees according to \xe2\x80\x9cthe practice in the relevant market.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 U. S., at 288.  But we think the fairest interpretation of the implementing release is that it does not address how awards for paralegal fees should be calculated.  Instead, it addresses the anterior question whether courts may award paralegal fees under EAJA at all.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 46 Fed. Reg. 32905 (responding to comments urging that the model rules \xe2\x80\x9cidentify particular expenses of attorneys and witnesses that are compensable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Like the other legislative authorities cited by the Government, the model rules fail to persuade us of the soundness of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation because they fail to clearly address the question presented.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy rationale for recovery at attorney cost likewise unpersuasive.  The Government argues that market-based recovery would distort litigant incentives because EAJA would cap paralegal and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees at the same rate.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ttorney or agent fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the agency determines by regulation that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government observes that paralegal rates are lower than rates for attorneys operating in the same market.  If EAJA reimbursed both attorney time and paralegal time at market rates, then the cap would clip more off the top of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s rates than the paralegal\xe2\x80\x99s rates.  According to the Government, a market-based scheme would encourage litigants to shift an inefficient amount of attorney work to paralegals, since paralegal fees could be recovered at a greater percentage of their full market value.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem with this argument, as Richlin points out, is that it proves too much.  The same reasoning would imply that agent fees should not be recoverable at market rates.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  If market-based recovery of paralegal time resulted in excessive reliance on paralegals, then market-based recovery of agent time should result in excessive reliance on agents.  The same reasoning would also imply that fees for junior attorneys (who generally bill at lower rates than senior attorneys) should not be recoverable at market rates.  Cf. <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 287 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the fees are consistent with market rates and practices, the \xe2\x80\x98windfall\xe2\x80\x99 argument has no more force with regard to paralegals than it does for associates\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet despite the possibility that market-based recovery of attorney and agent fees would distort litigant incentives, \xc2\xa7504 unambiguously authorizes awards of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney or agent fees \xe2\x80\xa6 [at] prevailing market rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7504(b)(1)(A).  The Government offers no persuasive reason why Congress would have treated paralegal fees any differently.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy rationale thus founders on the text of the statute, which shows that Congress was untroubled by the very distortion the Government seeks to prevent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also question the practical feasibility of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute.  The Board in this case relied on the Internet for data on paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia, but the Government fails to explain why a law firm\xe2\x80\x99s cost should be limited to salary.  The benefits and perks with which a firm compensates its staff come out of the bottom line no less than salary.  The Government has offered no solution to this accounting problem, and we do not believe that solutions are readily to be found.  Market practice provides by far the more transparent basis for calculating a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s recovery under EAJA.  It strains credulity that Congress would have abandoned this predictable, workable framework for the uncertain and complex accounting requirements that a cost-based rule would inflict on litigants, their attorneys, administrative agencies, and the courts.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the statute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of construction.  According to the Government, any right to recover paralegal fees under EAJA must be read narrowly in light of the statutory canon requiring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sovereign immunity canon is just that\xe2\x80\x94a canon of construction.  It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction.  Indeed, the cases on which the Government relies all used other tools of construction in tandem with the sovereign immunity canon.  See <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U.

In this case, traditional tools of statutory construction and considerations of stare decisis compel the conclusion that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees at their \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U.

We assume without deciding that the reasoning of our opinion would extend equally to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7504 and 2412.  We confine our discussion to \xc2\xa7504.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government contends that the question presented does not fairly include the question whether the cost of paralegal services should be calculated from the perspective of the litigant rather than the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney.  We disagree.  The question presented in Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari was whether \xe2\x80\x9ca prevailing party [may] be awarded attorney fees for paralegal services at the market rate for such services, \xe2\x80\xa6 [or at] cost only.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  A decision limiting reimbursement to \xe2\x80\x9ccost only\xe2\x80\x9d would simply beg the question of how that cost should be measured.  Since the question presented cannot genuinely be answered without addressing the subsidiary question, we have no difficulty concluding that the latter question is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly included\xe2\x80\x9d within the former.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule\xc2\xa014.1(a).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is worth recalling that the Board calculated Richlin\xe2\x80\x99s award based on an Internet survey of paralegal salaries in the District of Columbia.  Presumably the salaries the Board identified represented the market rate for paralegal compensation.  The limited award that the Government wants affirmed was thus based, ironically enough, on the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing market rates\xe2\x80\x9d for paralegal services.  The fact that paralegal salaries respond to market forces no less than the fees that clients pay suggests to us that this case has more to do with determining whose expenditures get reimbursed (the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s or the client\xe2\x80\x99s) than with determining how expenditures are calculated (at cost or at market).  Since EAJA authorizes the recovery of fees and other expenses \xe2\x80\x9cincurred by [the] party,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7504(a)(1), rather than the party\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, the answer to the former question is plain.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Following our decision in <em>Casey</em>, Congress amended \xc2\xa71988 to allow parties to recover \xe2\x80\x9cexpert fees as part of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa7113(a), 105 Stat. 1079 (codified at 42 U.
