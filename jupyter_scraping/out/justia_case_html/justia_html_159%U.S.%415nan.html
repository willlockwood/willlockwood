One of the judgments so pleaded was against the people of the State of California, and two of them were against the City and County of San Francisco.  The actions in which those judgments were made in each instance involved the same land and the same question of dedication as here in dispute, and the prevailing parties were these defendants or their predecessor in interest.</p>\n<p>The trial court decided that each of the two judgments against the City and County of San Francisco was, as a plea, a bar, and as evidence conclusive against the claim of dedication made by the plaintiffs in the present action, and that the court was thereby precluded from again inquiring into the question or claim of dedication made by the plaintiffs in this action.  That decision was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.</p>\n<p>To that judgment this writ of error was sued out by the state, and the defendants moved to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction on the ground that no federal question was involved.  On behalf of the State of California, it was contended that a federal question was involved as follows:</p>\n<p>"The Supreme Court of the State of California first decided that the land in controversy was in fact dedicated to the public, as alleged in the complaint, by the Van Ness Ordinance, the act of the Legislature of California, and the Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 159 U.

W. Holladay v. The City and County of San Francisco,</em> and of <em>The City and County of San Francisco v. S. W. Holladay and others.</em>  To those two records the people of the State of California were strangers.  The state never consented that the city and county might submit the rights of the public to judgment in either of those actions.  Hence they claim that those judgments, so far as the people are concerned, were given without due process of law."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1916829">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>California v.
