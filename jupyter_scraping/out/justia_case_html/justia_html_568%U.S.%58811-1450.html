When respondent Knowles filed a proposed class action in Arkansas state court against petitioner Standard Fire Insurance Company, he stipulated that he and the class would seek less than $5 million in damages.  Pointing to CAFA, petitioner removed the case to the Federal District Court, but it remanded to the state court, concluding that the amount in controversy fell below the CAFA threshold in light of Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation, even though it found that the amount would have fallen above the threshold absent the stipulation.

However, the stipulation does not speak for those Knowles purports to represent, for a plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.

CAFA does not forbid a federal court to consider the possibility that a nonbinding, amount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class certification process.

For jurisdictional purposes, our inquiry is limited to examining the case \xe2\x80\x9cas of the time it was filed in state court,\xe2\x80\x9d Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schacht, \n\n524 U. S. 381, \n390 (1998)\n.  At that point, Knowles lacked the authority to concede the amount-in-controversy issue for the absent class members.  The Federal District Court, therefore, wrongly concluded that Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 precertification stipulation could overcome its finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had been met.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKnowles concedes that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be based on contingent future events.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 20.  Yet the two legal principles to which we have just referred\xe2\x80\x94that stipulations must be binding and that a named plaintiff cannot bind precertification class members\xe2\x80\x94mean that the amount to which Knowles has stipulated is in effect contingent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf, for example, as Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 complaint asserts, \xe2\x80\x9chundreds, and possibly thousands\xe2\x80\x9d of persons in Arkansas have similar claims, App. to Pet. for Cert. 66, and if each of those claims places a significant sum in controversy, the state court might certify the class and permit the case to proceed, but only on the condition that the stipulation be excised.  Or a court might find that Knowles is an inadequate representative due to the artificial cap he purports to impose on the class\xe2\x80\x99 recovery.  E.g., Back Doctors Ltd. v. Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 637 F.\xc2\xa03d 827, 830\xe2\x80\x93831 (CA7 2011) (noting a class representative\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty not to \xe2\x80\x9cthrow away what could be a major component of the class\xe2\x80\x99s recovery\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, another class mem- ber could intervene with an amended complaint (without a stipulation), and the District Court might permit the action to proceed with a new representative.  See 5 A. Conte &amp; H. Newberg, Class Actions \xc2\xa716:7, p.\xc2\xa0154 (4th ed. 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]embers of a class have a right to intervene if their interests are not adequately represented by existing parties\xe2\x80\x9d). Even were these possibilities remote in Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 own case, there is no reason to think them farfetched in other cases where similar stipulations could have more dramatic amount-lowering effects.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe strongest counterargument, we believe, takes a syl-logistic form: First, this complaint contains a presently nonbinding stipulation that the class will seek damages that amount to less than $5 million.  Second, if the state court eventually certifies that class, the stipulation will bind those who choose to remain as class members.  Third, if the state court eventually insists upon modification of the stipulation (thereby permitting class members to obtain more than $5 million), it will have in effect created a new, different case.  Fourth, CAFA, however, permits the federal court to consider only the complaint that the plaintiff has filed, i.e., this complaint, not a new, modified (or amended) complaint that might eventually emerge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.  We do not agree that CAFA forbids the federal court to consider, for purposes of determining the amount in controversy, the very real possibility that a nonbinding, amount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class certification process.  This potential outcome does not re-sult in the creation of a new case not now before the federal court.  To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdictional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it were binding, exalt form over substance, and run directly counter to CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective: ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cFederal court consideration of interstate cases of national impor-tance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(b)(2), \n\n119Stat.\n5.  It would also have the ef- fect of allowing the subdivision of a $100 million action into 21 just-below-$5-million state-court actions simply by including nonbinding stipulations; such an outcome would squarely conflict with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s objective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe agree with Knowles that a federal district court might find it simpler to value the amount in controversy on the basis of a stipulation than to aggregate the value of the individual claims of all who meet the class description.  We also agree that, when judges must decide jurisdictional matters, simplicity is a virtue.  See Hertz Corp. v. Friend, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77, \n94 (2010)\n.  But to ignore a nonbinding stipulation does no more than require the federal judge to do what she must do in cases without a stipulation and what the statute requires, namely \xe2\x80\x9caggregat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cclaims of the individual class members.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(d)(6).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKnowles also points out that federal courts permit individual plaintiffs, who are the masters of their complaints, to avoid removal to federal court, and to obtain a remand to state court, by stipulating to amounts at issue that fall below the federal jurisdictional requirement.  That is so.  See St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., \n\n303 U.\xc2\xa0S. 283, \n294 (1938)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIf [a plaintiff] does not desire to try his case in the federal court he may resort to the expedi-ent of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and though he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant cannot remove\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the key characteristic about those stipulations is that they are legally binding on all plaintiffs.  See 14AA C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Fed-eral Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73702.1, p.\xc2\xa0335 (4th ed. 2011) (federal court, as condition for remand, can insist on a \xe2\x80\x9cbinding affidavit or stipulation that the plaintiff will continue to claim less than the jurisdictional amount\xe2\x80\x9d (em-phasis added)).  That essential feature is missing here, as Knowles cannot yet bind the absent class.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKnowles argues in the alternative that a stipulation is binding to the extent it limits attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees so that the amount in controversy remains below the CAFA threshold.  We do not consider this issue because Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation did not provide for that option.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, the stipulation at issue here can tie Knowles\xe2\x80\x99 hands, but it does not resolve the amount-in-controversy question in light of his inability to bind the rest of the class.  For this reason, we believe the District Court, when following the statute to aggregate the proposed class members\xe2\x80\x99 claims, should have ignored that stipulation.  Because it did not, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
