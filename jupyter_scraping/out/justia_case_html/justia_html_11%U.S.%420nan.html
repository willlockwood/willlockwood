A loss by capture having taken place, the plaintiff offered an abandonment which was refused, wherefore he brought this action:</p>\n<p>To prove his citizenship and support the warranty, he produced and read at the trial an exemplification duly authenticated, of the record of his naturalization, in the words following, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p>"At a court of common pleas held at York for the County of York on the third Monday of May. 1804, before John Joseph Henry, Esq., president and his associate judges, &amp;c., assigned, &amp;c."</p>\n<p>"The petition of John Philip Stark, late of Wetgenstein Berleburg, in the empire of Germany, was read to the court, setting forth that your petitioner has resided in the State of Pennsylvania five years, that he is now desirous of becoming a citizen of the United States conformably to the act of Congress in such case lately provided; your petitioner therefore prays of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 11 U.

S. 423</a></p><p></p>\n<p>1. That the decision of the Court of Common Pleas for the County of York was conclusive.  That court had power and authority to admit aliens to the right of citizenship -- and having admitted the plaintiff, the grounds of their decision cannot now be inquired into, nor the correctness of their judgment questioned.</p>\n<p>2. That if the record of admission be not conclusive, yet it was competent for the plaintiff to prove now by parol evidence the facts which did, at the time he was admitted, entitle him to the benefit of the act of 26 March, 1804.</p>\n<p>Submitted the question arising in this case without argument to the Court, which, without giving a more particular opinion, pronounced the following JUDGMENT:</p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof this Court is of opinion that the circuit court erred in directing the jury that the plaintiff had failed in proving the property insured under the policy to be American property.  It is therefore considered by the Court that the judgment of the circuit court be reversed and annulled and the cause remanded to that court to be further proceeded in according to law.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
