Because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction in this case, we again must leave the issue undecided. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="624">Page 450 U. S. 624</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellant owns a 412-acre parcel of land in Sorrento Valley, an area in the northwest part of the city of San Diego, Cal.  It assembled and acquired the acreage in 1966, at a cost of about $1,770,000, as a possible site for a nuclear power plant to be constructed in the 1980\'s.  Approximately 214 acres of the parcel lie within or near an estuary known as the Los Penasquitos Lagoon. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  These acres are low-lying land which serves as a drainage basin for three river systems.  About a third of the land is subject to tidal action from the nearby Pacific Ocean.  The 214 acres are unimproved, except for sewer and utility lines. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>When appellant acquired the 214 acres, most of the land was zoned either for industrial use or in an agricultural "holding" category. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The city\'s master plan, adopted in 1967, designated nearly all the area for industrial use.</p>\n<p>Several events that occurred in 1973 gave rise to this litigation.  First, the San Diego City Council rezoned parts of the property.  It changed 39 acres from industrial to agricultural, and increased the minimum lot size in some of the agricultural areas from 1 acre to 10 acres.  The Council </p><p><a class="page-number" name="625">Page 450 U. S. 625</a></p><p> recommended, however, that 50 acres of the agricultural land be considered for industrial development upon the submission of specific development plans.</p>\n<p>Second, the city, pursuant to Cal.Gov\'t Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 65563 (West Supp. 1981), established an open-space plan.  This statute required each California city and county to adopt a plan "for the comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction."  The plan adopted by the city of San Diego placed appellant\'s property among the city\'s open-space areas, which it defined as</p>\n<p>"any urban land or water surface that is essentially open or natural in character, and which has appreciable utility for park and recreation purposes, conservation of land, water or other natural resources or historic or scenic purposes."</p>\n<p>App. 159.  The plan acknowledged appellant\'s intention to construct a nuclear power plant on the property, stating that such a plant would not necessarily be incompatible with the open-space designation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The plan proposed, however, that the city acquire the property to preserve it as parkland.</p>\n<p>Third, the City Council proposed a bond issue in order to obtain funds to acquire open-space lands.  The Council identified appellant\'s land as among those properties to be acquired with the proceeds of the bond issue.  The proposition, however, failed to win the voters\' approval.  The open-space plan has remained in effect, but the city has made no attempt to acquire appellant\'s property.</p>\n<p>On August 15, 1974, appellant instituted this action in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego against the city and a number of its officials.  It alleged that the city had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="626">Page 450 U. S. 626</a></p><p> taken its property without just compensation, in violation of the Constitutions of the United States and California.  Appellant\'s theory was that the city had deprived it of the entire beneficial use of the property through the rezoning and the adoption of the open-space plan.  It alleged that the city followed a policy of refusing to approve any development that was inconsistent with the plan, and that the only beneficial use of the property was as an industrial park, a use that would be inconsistent with the open-space designation. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The city disputed this allegation, arguing that appellant had never asked its approval for any development plan for the property.  It also contended that, as a charter city, it was not bound by the open-space plan, even if appellant\'s proposed development would be inconsistent with the plan, citing Cal.Gov\'t Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 65700, 65803 (West 1966 and Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p>Appellant sought damages of $6,150,000 in inverse condemnation, as well as mandamus and declaratory relief.  Prior to trial, the court dismissed the mandamus claim, holding that "mandamus is not the proper remedy to challenge the validity of a legislative act."  Clerk\'s Tr. 42.  After a nonjury trial on the issue of liability, the court granted judgment for appellant, finding that:</p>\n<p>"29. [Due to the] continuing course of conduct of the defendant City culminating in June of 1973, and, in particular, the designation of substantially all of the subject property as open space . . . , plaintiff has been deprived of all practical, beneficial or economic use of the property designated as open space, and has further suffered severance damage with respect to the balance of the subject property. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="627">Page 450 U. S. 627</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"30. No development could proceed on the property designated as open space unless it was consistent with open space.  In light of the particular characteristics of the said property, there exists no practical, beneficial or economic use of the said property designated as open space which is consistent with open space."</p>\n<p>"31. Since June 19, 1973, the property designated as open space has been devoted to use by the public as open space."</p>\n<p>"32. Following the actions of the defendant City in June of 1973, it would have been totally impractical and futile for plaintiff to have applied to defendant City for the approval of any development of the property designated as open space or the remainder of the subject property."</p>\n<p>"33. Since the actions of the defendant City in June of 1973, the property designated as open space and the remainder of the larger parcel is unmarketable in that no other person would be willing to purchase the property, and the property has, at most, a nominal fair market value."</p>\n<p>App. 41-42.</p>\n<p>The court concluded that these findings established that the city had taken the property and that just compensation was required by the Constitutions of both the United States and California.  A subsequent jury trial on the question of damages resulted in a judgment for appellant for over $3 million.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, affirmed.  App. to Juris.Statement 1; <em>see</em> 146 Cal.Rptr. 103 (1978).  It held that neither a change in zoning nor the adoption of an open-space plan automatically entitled a property owner to compensation for any resulting diminution in the value of the property.  In this case, however, the record revealed that the city followed the policy of enacting and enforcing zoning ordinance that were consistent with its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 450 U. S. 628</a></p><p> open-space plan.  The Court of Appeal also found that the evidence supported the conclusion that industrial use was the only feasible use for the property, and that the city would have denied any application for industrial development because it would be incompatible with the open-space designation.  Appellant\'s failure to present a plan for developing the property therefore did not preclude an award of damages in its favor.  The Court of Appeal, with one judge dissenting, denied the city\'s petition for rehearing.  <em>See</em> 146 Cal.Rptr. at 118.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of California, however, on July 13, 1978, granted the city\'s petition for a hearing.  This action automatically vacated the Court of Appeal\'s decision, depriving it of all effect.  <em>Knouse v. Nimocks,</em> 8 Cal.2d 482, 483-484, 66 P.2d 43 (1937).  <em>See also</em> Cal.Rules of Court 976(d) and 977 (West 1981).  Before the hearing, the Supreme Court, in June, 1979, retransferred the case to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of the intervening decision in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon,</em> 24 Cal.3d 266, 598 P.2d 25 (1979), <em>aff\'d,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 447</a></span> U.S. 255 (1980). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The California court, in <em>Agins,</em> held that an owner who is deprived of substantially all beneficial use of his land by a zoning regulation is not entitled to an award of damages in an inverse condemnation proceeding.  Rather, his exclusive remedy is invalidation of the regulation in an action for mandamus or declaratory relief. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Agins</em> also </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 450 U. S. 629</a></p><p> held that the plaintiffs in that case were not entitled to such relief because the zoning ordinance at issue permitted the building of up to five residences on their property.  Therefore, the court held, it did not deprive those plaintiffs of substantially all reasonable use of their land. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>When the present case was retransferred, the Court of Appeal, in an unpublished opinion, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court.  App. 63.  It relied upon the California decision in <em>Agins</em> and held that appellant could not recover compensation through inverse condemnation.  It, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 450 U. S. 630</a></p><p> did not invalidate either the zoning ordinance or the open-space plan.  Instead, it held that factual disputes precluded such relief on the present state of the record:</p>\n<p>"[Appellant] complains it has been denied all use of its land which is zoned for agriculture and manufacturing but lies within the open space area of the general plan.  It has not made application to use or improve the property, nor has it asked [the] City what development might be permitted.  Even assuming no use is acceptable to the City, [appellant\'s] complaint deals with the alleged overzealous use of the police power by [the] City.  Its remedy is mandamus or declaratory relief, not inverse condemnation.  [Appellant] did in its complaint seek these remedies, asserting that [the] City had arbitrarily exercised its police power by enacting an unconstitutional zoning law and general plan element or by applying the zoning and general plan unconstitutionally.  However, on the present record, these are disputed fact issues not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions.  They can be dealt with anew should [appellant] elect to retry the case."</p>\n<p>App. 66.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of California denied further review.  App. to Juris.Statement I-1.  Appellant appealed to this Court, arguing that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require that compensation be paid whenever private property is taken for public use.  Appellant takes issue with the California Supreme Court\'s holding in <em>Agins</em> that its remedy is limited to invalidation of the ordinance in a proceeding for mandamus or declaratory relief.  We postponed consideration of our jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.  447 U.S. 919 (1980).  We now conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because of the absence of a final judgment. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="631">Page 450 U. S. 631</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Agins,</em> the California Supreme Court held that mandamus or declaratory relief is available whenever a zoning regulation is claimed to effect an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeal\'s failure, therefore, to award such relief in this case clearly indicates its conclusion that the record does not support appellant\'s claim that an uncompensated taking has occurred. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Because the court found that the record presented "disputed fact issues not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions," App. 66, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] it held that mandamus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 450 U. S. 632</a></p><p> and declaratory relief would be available "should [appellant] elect to retry the case."  <em>Ibid.</em>  While this phrase appears to us to be somewhat ambiguous, we read it as meaning that appellant is to have an opportunity on remand to convince the trial court to resolve the disputed issues in its favor.  We do not believe that the Court of Appeal was holding that judgment must be entered for the city.  It certainly did not so direct.  This indicates that appellant is free to pursue its quest for relief in the Superior Court.  The logical course of action for an appellate court that finds unresolved factual disputes in the record is to remand the case for the resolution of those disputes.  We therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal\'s decision contemplates further proceedings in the trial court. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Ever since this Court\'s decision in <em>Grays Harbor Co. v. Coats-Fordney Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/243/251/case.html">243 U. S. 251</a></span> (1917), a state court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 450 U. S. 633</a></p><p> holding that private property has been taken in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and that further proceedings are necessary to determine the compensation that must be paid has been regarded as a classic example of a decision not reviewable in this Court because it is not "final."  In such a case, "the remaining litigation may raise other federal questions that may later come here."  <em>Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html">326 U.

This is because</p>\n<p>"the federal constitutional question embraces not only a taking, but a taking on payment of just compensation.  A state judgment is not final unless it covers both aspects of that integral problem."</p>\n<p><em>North Dakota Board of Pharmacy v.

S. 163</a></span> (1973).</p>\n<p>This case presents the reverse aspect of that situation.  The Court of Appeal has decided that monetary compensation is not an appropriate remedy for any taking of appellant\'s property that may have occurred, but it has not decided whether any other remedy is available, because it has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred.  Thus, however we might rule with respect to the Court of Appeal\'s decision that appellant is not entitled to a monetary remedy -- and we are frank to say that the federal constitutional aspects of that issue are not to be cast aside lightly -- further proceedings are necessary to resolve the federal question whether there has been a taking at all.  The court\'s decision, therefore, is not final, and we are without jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p>Because \xc2\xa7 1257 permits us to review only "[f]inal judgments or decrees" of a state court, the appeal must be, and is, dismissed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."</p>\n<p>The Fifth Amendment\'s prohibition applies against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q.

There are now at least four categories of such cases in which the Court has treated the decision of the federal issue as a final judgment for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 and has taken jurisdiction without awaiting the completion of the additional proceedings anticipated in the lower state courts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#477">420 U.

The procedural history of this case in the state courts is anomalous, to say the least, and it has resulted in a majority of this Court concluding that the California courts have not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#631">450 U.

S. 661</a></span>, n. 27.  Having read the characterization of the California court proceedings in the opinion of this Court and in the opinion of JUSTICE BRENNAN as carefully as I can, I can only conclude that they disagree as to what issues remain open on remand from the State Court of Appeal to the Superior Court, but agree that such proceedings may occur.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, it seems to me to be entirely in accord with the language of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257, though perhaps not entirely in accord with the above-quoted portion of the opinion in <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, supra,</em> to conclude that this appeal is not from a "final judgment or decree."  I would feel much better able to formulate federal constitutional principles of damages for land use regulation which amounts to a taking of land under the Eminent Domain Clause of the Fifth Amendment if I knew what disposition the California courts finally made of this case.  Because I do not, and cannot, at this stage of the litigation, know that, I join the opinion of the Court today in which the appeal is dismissed for want of a final judgment.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE STEWART, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 limits this Court\'s jurisdiction to review judgments of state courts to "[f]inal judgments or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 450 U. S. 637</a></p><p> decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had."  The Court today dismisses this appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal of California, Fourth District, failed to decide the federal question whether a "taking" of appellant\'s property had occurred, and therefore had not entered a final judgment or decree on that question appealable under \xc2\xa7 1257.  Because the Court\'s conclusion fundamentally mischaracterizes the holding and judgment of the Court of Appeal, I respectfully dissent from the Court\'s dismissal and reach the merits of appellant\'s claim.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1966, appellant assembled a 412-acre parcel of land as a potential site for a nuclear power plant.  At that time, approximately 116 acres of the property were zoned for industrial use, with most of the balance zoned in an agricultural holding category.  In 1967, appellee city of San Diego adopted its general plan designating most of appellant\'s property for industrial use.  In 1973, the city took three critical actions which, together, form the predicate of the instant litigation:  it down-zoned some of appellant\'s property from industrial to agricultural; it incorporated a new open-space element in its plan that designated about 233 acres of appellant\'s land for open-space use; [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] and it prepared a report mapping appellant\'s property for purchase by the city for open-space use, contingent on passage of a bond issue.  App. 49.</p>\n<p>Appellant filed suit in California Superior Court alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> a "taking" of its property by "inverse condemnation" in violation of the United States and California Constitutions, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 450 U. S. 638</a></p><p> and seeking compensation of over $6 million.  After a nonjury trial on liability, the court held that appellee city had taken a portion of appellant\'s property without just compensation, thereby violating the United States and California Constitutions.  <em>Id.</em> at 42-43.  A subsequent jury trial on damages resulted in a judgment of over $3 million, plus interest as of the date of the "taking," and appraisal, engineering, and attorney\'s fees.  <em>Id.</em> at 46.</p>\n<p>The California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, affirmed, holding that there was "substantial evidence to support the court\'s conclusion [that] there was inverse condemnation."  <em>Id.</em> at 54.  The California Supreme Court granted the city\'s petition for a hearing, App. to Juris.Statement 1, but later transferred the case back to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon,</em> 24 Cal.3d 266, 598 P.2d 25 (1979), <em>aff\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/case.html">447 U. S. 255</a></span> (1980).

S. 639</a></p><p> Court of Appeal this time reversed the Superior Court, holding:</p>\n<p>"Unlike the person whose property is taken in eminent domain, the individual who is deprived of his property due to the state\'s exercise of its police power is not entitled to compensation. . . .  A local entity\'s arbitrary unconstitutional exercise of the police power which deprives the owner of the beneficial use of his land does not require compensation; rather the party\'s remedy is administrative mandamus. . . ."</p>\n<p>App. 65-66.  The California Supreme Court denied further review.  App. to Juris.Statement I-1.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court today holds that the judgment below is not "final" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 because, although the California Court of Appeal "has decided that monetary compensation is not an appropriate remedy for any taking of appellant\'s property that may have occurred, . . . it has not decided whether any other remedy is available because <em>it has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred.</em>"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#633">450 U. S. 633</a></span> (emphasis added).  With all due respect, this conclusion misreads the holding of the Court of Appeal.  In faithful compliance with the instructions of the California Supreme Court\'s opinion in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra,</em> the Court of Appeal held that the city\'s exercise of its police power, however arbitrary or excessive, could not, <em>as a matter of federal constitutional law,</em> constitute a "taking" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore that there was no "taking" without just compensation in the instant case.</p>\n<p>Examination of the Court of Appeal\'s opinion and the California Supreme Court\'s <em>Agins</em> opinion confirms this reading.  As indicated above, the Court of Appeal noted that,</p>\n<p>"[u]nlike the person whose property is <em>taken</em> in eminent domain, the individual who is <em>deprived</em> of his property due </p><p><a class="page-number" name="640">Page 450 U. S. 640</a></p><p> to the state\'s exercise of its police power is not entitled to compensation."</p>\n<p>App. 65-66 (emphasis added).  Under the Court of Appeal\'s view, there can be no Fifth Amendment "taking" outside of the eminent domain context.  Thus, a</p>\n<p>"local entity\'s arbitrary unconstitutional exercise of the police power which deprives the owner of the beneficial use of his land does not require compensation; rather, the party\'s remedy is administrative mandamus."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 66 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal\'s analysis was required by the California Supreme Court\'s opinion in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra.</em>  There the court stated:</p>\n<p>"Plaintiffs contend that the limitations on the use of their land imposed by the ordinance constitute an unconstitutional \'taking of [plaintiff\'s] property without payment of just compensation\' for which an action in inverse condemnation will lie.  <em>Inherent in the contention is the argument that a local entity\'s exercise of its police power which, in a given case, may exceed constitutional limits is equivalent to the lawful taking of property by eminent domain, thereby necessitating the payment of compensation.  We are unable to accept this argument,</em> believing the preferable view to be that, while such governmental action is invalid because of its excess, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="641">Page 450 U. S. 641</a></p><p> remedy by way of damages in eminent domain is not thereby made available."</p>\n<p>24 Cal.3d at 272, 598 P.2d at 28 (brackets in original) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  A landowner may not</p>\n<p>"elect to sue in inverse condemnation, and thereby <em>transmute an excessive use of the police power</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="642">Page 450 U.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court therefore errs, I respectfully submit, when it concludes that the Court of Appeal "has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#633">450 U.

For whatever the merits of the California courts\' substantive rulings on the federal constitutional issue, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#646">450 U. S. 646</a></span>-661, it is clear that the California Supreme Court has held that California courts in a challenge, as here, to a police power regulation, are barred from holding that a Fifth Amendment "\\taking\\" requiring just compensation has occurred. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  No set of factual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 450 U.

City of Tiburon, supra</em> at 273, 598 P.2d at 28.  This Court\'s focus on the last full paragraph of the Court of Appeal decision, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#630">450 U. S. 630</a></span>, to support its conclusion is misplaced, because that paragraph merely raises the possibility that appellant may "elect to retry the case" on a different constitutional theory -- an allegation of "overzealous use of the police power," App. 66.  Whatever factual findings of the trial court might be relevant to that inquiry, they would have no bearing on a Fifth Amendment "taking" claim. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Therefore, the Court\'s suggestion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 450 U. S. 644</a></p><p> that "further proceedings are necessary to resolve the federal question whether there has been a taking at all" is plainly wrong.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#633">450 U.

The Court of Appeal reversed this holding and concluded as a matter of law that no Fifth Amendment "taking" had occurred.  This is indistinguishable, then, from a dismissal of appellant\'s case for legal insufficiency.  In any such dismissal, factual questions are necessarily left unresolved.  But when a litigant is denied relief as a matter of law, the judgment is necessarily final within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1257.  <em>See, e.g., Allenberg Cotton Co. v.

From the government\'s point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production through a dam project that floods private property.

But "the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 450 U.

It is only logical, then, that government action other than acquisition of title, occupancy, or physical invasion can be a "taking," and therefore a <em>de facto</em> exercise of the power of eminent domain, where the effects completely deprive the owner of all or most of his interest in the property.  <em>United States v.

Appellant argues that it is entitled to the full fair market value of the property.  Appellees argue that invalidation of the regulation is sufficient, without payment of monetary compensation.  In my view, once a court establishes that there was a regulatory "taking," the Constitution demands that the government entity pay just compensation for the period commencing on the date the regulation first effected the "taking," and ending on the date the government entity chooses to rescind or otherwise amend [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] the regulation. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  This interpretation, I believe, is supported </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 450 U. S. 654</a></p><p> by the express words and purpose of the Just Compensation Clause, as well as by cases of this Court construing it.</p>\n<p>The language of the Fifth Amendment prohibits,the "tak[ing]" of private property for "public use" without payment of "just compensation."  As soon as private property has been taken, whether through formal condemnation proceedings, occupancy, physical invasion, or regulation, the landowner has <em>already</em> suffered a constitutional violation, and "<em>the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to compensation,\'" <em>United States v.

Sackman, Nichols\' Law of Eminent Domain \xc2\xa7 25.41 (rev. 3d ed.1980), is triggered.  This Court has consistently recognized that the just compensation requirement in the Fifth Amendment is not precatory:  once there is a "taking," compensation <em>must</em> be awarded.  In <em>Jacobs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/13/case.html">290 U.

Petitioners brought suit against the Government to recover just compensation for the partial "taking."  Commenting on the nature of the landowners\' action, the Court observed:\n</em></p>\n<p>"The suits were based on the right to recover just compensation for property taken by the United States for public use in the exercise of its power of eminent domain.  That right was guaranteed by the Constitution.  The fact that condemnation proceedings were not instituted and that the right was asserted in suits by the owners did not change the essential nature of the claim.  The form of the remedy did not qualify the right.  It rested upon the Fifth Amendment.  Statutory recognition was not necessary.  A promise to pay was not necessary.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 450 U.

Just as the government may cancel condemnation proceedings before passage of title, <em>see</em> 6 J.

The government must inform the court of its intentions vis-a-vis the regulation with sufficient clarity to guarantee a correct assessment of the just compensation award.

In the typical condemnation proceeding, the government brings a judicial or administrative action against the property owner to "take" the fee simple or an interest in his property; the judicial or administrative body enters a decree of condemnation, and just compensation is awarded.  <em>See ibid.</em> <em>See generally</em> 6 J. Sackman, Nichols\' Law of Eminent Domain \xc2\xa7 24.1 (rev. 3d ed.1980).  In an "inverse condemnation" action, the condemnation is "inverse" because it is the landowner, not the government entity, who institutes the proceeding.</p>\n<p>"Eminent domain" is the "power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner\'s consent."  <em>Id.</em> \xc2\xa7 1.11, at 1-7.

The Constitution requires that just compensation be paid to landowners whose property has been condemned or taken by a government exercising its eminent domain power; if property is taken and no compensation awarded, the landowner is entitled to bring a so-called inverse condemnation action to compel payment.  In contrast, under the police power, constitutional requirements relate to the reasonableness of the relation between the means used and the ends sought; a landowner affected by an unreasonable regulation is entitled to bring an action challenging its validity."</p>\n<p>Note, <em>Eldridge v.

Instead, the court noted that</p>\n<p>"a zoning ordinance may be unconstitutional and subject to invalidation only when its effect is to <em>deprive</em> the landowner of substantially all reasonable use of his property,"</p>\n<p>and that "[t]he ordinance before us had no such effect."  24 Cal.3d at 277, 598 P.2d at 31 (emphasis added).  Throughout the <em>Agins</em> opinion as well as the Court of Appeal decision below are references to actions which "deprive" the landowner of property use, indicating that the California courts were proceeding under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and not the Just Compensation Clause.  <em>Id.</em> at 273, 277, 598 P.2d at 28, 31; App. 66.  Indeed the California courts are not alone in concluding that a government\'s exercise of its regulatory police powers can never effect a "taking."  Five years ago, the Court of Appeals of New York reached the same conclusion.  <em>See Fred F. French Investing Co. v.

This Court described a subsequent New York Court of Appeals decision on review here as</p>\n<p>"summarily reject[ing] any claim that the [New York City] Landmarks Law had \'taken\' property without \'just compensation,\' . . . indicating that there could be no \'taking,\' since the law had not transferred control of the property to the city, but only restricted appellants\' exploitation of it.

However, a reviewing court may qualify its reversal, and its intent must be divined from its opinion as a whole.  <em>Stromer v. Browning,</em> 268 Cal.App.2d 513, 518-519, 74 Cal.Rptr. 155, 158 (1968); 5 Cal.Jur. 3d, <em>supra,</em> \xc2\xa7 588, at 304.</p>\n<p>Here, the Court of Appeal suggested that, if appellee elected to retry the case, "disputed fact issues <em>not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions</em>" could be "dealt with anew."  App. 66 (emphasis added).  In the original "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law," the trial court unequivocally found a Fifth Amendment "taking" without just compensation:</p>\n<p>"The actions of defendant City against plaintiff\'s property were motivated to achieve a public purpose, namely, preservation of open space, without payment of just compensation, and were so burdensome and oppressive as to deprive plaintiff of any practical, beneficial or economic use of the property designated as open space, and, therefore, taken as a whole, constitute a <em>taking</em> of the portion of plaintiff\'s property designated as open space without due process of law and just compensation within the meaning of the California and United States constitutions. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 42-43 (emphasis added).  By limiting any possible retrial to "disputed fact issues not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions," the Court of Appeal plainly indicated that the Fifth Amendment "taking" issue had been finally resolved.  This is perfectly consistent, then, with the Court of Appeal\'s holding that there is no Fifth Amendment "taking" when excessive use of the police power is proved.  Therefore, the Court\'s belief that the "disputed factual issues" involve appellant\'s failure to apply for a permit, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#631">450 U. S. 631</a></span>, n. 11, is beside the point, since under no set of factual circumstances may the court find a Fifth Amendment "taking."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal\'s first opinion unequivocally affirmed the Superior Court\'s finding of a "taking" on the facts of this case.  App. 49-50, 60.  It is no doubt true that the first opinion was deprived of all legal effect under California law once the California Supreme Court granted the city\'s petition for a hearing.  <em>Knouse v. Nimocks,</em> 8 Cal.2d 482, 48384, 66 P.2d 438, 438 (1937).  Nevertheless, under this Court\'s view that the second Court of Appeal\'s opinion left open the "taking" question, this Court must admit, as it does, that the second opinion is inconsistent with the finding of a "taking" in the first.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#631">450 U.

Under my reading, the second is easily reconcilable with the first:  because the Court of Appeal was obligated by the terms of the California Supreme Court\'s transfer order to hold that no regulatory action could effect a "taking," it was forced in its second opinion to abandon its original agreement with the Superior Court\'s finding of a "taking."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>In his concurring opinion, my Brother REHNQUIST, who dissented in <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.

Then, he assumes that I agree with the Court that further proceedings will occur on remand to the Superior Court, and concludes that this appeal is therefore not final within the literal language of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257, even if it may be treated as final under <em>Cox.</em> <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/621/case.html#636">450 U. S. 636</a></span>.</p>\n<p>With all respect, my Brother REHNQUIST misreads my position.  I view the judgment as final within the literal meaning of \xc2\xa7 1257, and therefore do not find it necessary to rely on any "exception" to the finality rule.  Appellant alleged and proved a "taking" of its property without just compensation under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On review, the California Court of Appeal reversed, holding as a matter of federal law that there was no "taking."  Since that time, appellant has continued to press its federal just compensation claim in a petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeal, a petition for hearing before the California Supreme Court, and an appeal to this Court.  The Court of Appeal did not direct further proceedings in the Superior Court on appellant\'s claim.  What the Court of Appeal indicated was that appellant was not precluded from "elect[ing] to retry the case," App. 66, on an alternative constitutional theory not based on the Just Compensation Clause.  In other words, the Court of Appeal refused to recognize an alleged and proved constitutional violation, and proposed that appellant try another and different constitutional theory.  But obviously the judgment is final as to the rejected constitutional theory under even the strictest reading of \xc2\xa7 1257.

In partial reliance on Justice Brandeis\' dissent, one report urges that the Court overrule the <em>Pennsylvania Coal</em> case and hold that "a regulation of the use of land, if reasonably related to a valid public purpose, can never constitute a taking."

Banta, The Taking Issue 238-255 (1973) .</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/17" name="F2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court, in its opinion in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon,</em> 24 Cal.3d at 274, 598 P.2d at 29, interpreted Justice Holmes\' use of the word "taking" to "indicate the <em>limit</em> by which the acknowledged social goal of land control could be achieved by regulation rather than by eminent domain." (Emphasis added.)  I find such a reading unpersuasive.  The Court specifically indicated that a "regulation [that] goes too far . . . <em>will be recognized as a taking,</em>" and that this determination is "<em>a question of degree.</em>"  <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon,</em> 260 U.S. at 415-416 (emphasis added).  Clearly, then, the Court contemplated that a regulation could cross the boundary surrounding valid police power exercise and become a Fifth Amendment "taking."</p>\n<p>The California court further argued that the Court in <em>Pennsylvania Coal</em></p>\n<p>"did not attempt . . . to transmute the illegal governmental infringement into an exercise of eminent domain, and the possibility of compensation was not even considered."</p>\n<p><em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra</em> at 274, 598 P.2d at 29.  This overlooks the factual posture in <em>Pennsylvania Coal,</em> where the homeowner, not the coal company, brought an injunction action to prevent the company "from mining under their property in such a way as to remove the support and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house."  <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/case.html#412">260 U. S. 412</a></span>.  Because no one asked for an award of just compensation, there was no reason for the Court to consider it.  The company only sought reversal of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\'s decree that enjoined it from mining coal, and this Court granted that request.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/18" name="F2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>In the instant case, for example, appellant contended that the city\'s actions "denied in all practical effect any possible beneficial or economical use of the subject property."

Although the Court of Appeal\'s first opinion has no legal effect, <em>see</em> <l=|450 621fn2="" 8|="" u.s.="">n. 8, <em>supra,</em> the court did observe that the city\'s objective was</l=|450></p>\n<p>"to have the property remain unused, undisturbed and in its natural state so open space and scenic vistas may be preserved.

Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23, and n. 24.  But since the California courts fail to concede that a regulation can effect a "taking," any award of interim damages would not be justified or determined, as constitutionally required, under the Just Compensation Clause.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/21" name="F2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Amici</em> suggest that the Court\'s awards of just compensation in cases involving the United States were premised either on a "theory of implied promise to pay . . . or [on] congressional authorization [to pay] under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (a)."  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 27; <em>see</em> Brief for the National Trust for Historic Preservation <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7-8.  This suggestion mischaracterizes the import of our cases.  As the Court has noted:</p>\n<p>"But whether the theory . . . be that there was a taking under the Fifth Amendment, and that therefore the Tucker Act may be invoked because it is a claim founded upon the Constitution, or that there was an implied promise by the Government to pay for it, is immaterial.  In either event, the claim traces back to the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment, \'nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\'  The Constitution is \'intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Dickinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/745/case.html">331 U.

The trial court, on April 9, 1976, found that the city\'s actions effected a "taking" of appellant\'s property on June 19, 1973.  If true, then appellant has been deprived of all beneficial use of its property in violation of the Just Compensation Clause for the past seven years.</p>\n<p>Invalidation hardly prevents enactment of subsequent unconstitutional regulations by the government entity.  At the 1974 annual conference of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in California, a California City Attorney gave fellow City Attorneys the following advice:</p>\n<p>"<em>IF ALL ELSE FAILS, MERELY AMEND THE REGULATION AND START OVER AGAIN.</em>"</p>\n<p>"If legal preventive maintenance does not work, and you still receive a claim attacking the land use regulation, or if you try the case and lose, don\'t worry about it.  All is not lost.  One of the extra \'goodies\' contained in the recent [California] Supreme Court case of <em>Selb v. City of San Buenaventura,</em> 10 C.3d 110, appears to allow the City to change the regulation in question, even after trial and judgment, make it more reasonable, more restrictive, or whatever, and everybody starts over again."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"See how easy it is to be a City Attorney.

Although the government entity may not be forced to pay just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, the landowner may nevertheless have a damages cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/24" name="F2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]</p>\n<p>Contrary to the suggestion of <em>amici, see, e.g.,</em> Brief for the National Trust for Historic Preservation <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11, this is not a case involving implication of a damages remedy -- the words of the Just Compensation Clause are express.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/25" name="F2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See generally</em> D. Hagman  D. Misczynski, Windfalls for Wipeouts 296-297 (1978); Bosselman, The Third Alternative in Zoning Litigation, 17 Zoning Digest 113, 114-119 (1965).  The general notion of compensating landowners for regulations which go too far has received much attention in land use planning literature.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Costonis, "Fair" Compensation and the Accommodation Power:  Antidotes for the Taking Impasse in Land Use Controversies, 75 Colum.L.Rev. 1021 (1975); R.

Indeed, land use planning commentators have suggested that the threat of financial liability for unconstitutional police power regulations would help to produce a more rational basis of decisionmaking that weighs the costs of restrictions against their benefits.  Dunham, From Rural Enclosure to Re-Enclosure of Urban Land, 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1238, 1253-1254 (1960).  Such liability might also encourage municipalities to err on the constitutional side of police power regulations, and to develop internal rules and operating procedures to minimize overzealous regulatory attempts.  <em>Cf. Owen v. City of Independence,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/622/case.html">445 U.

After all, if a policeman must know the Constitution, then why not a planner?  In any event, one may wonder as an empirical matter whether the threat of just compensation will greatly impede the efforts of planners.  <em>Cf. id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/622/case.html#656">445 U.

I would not reach that issue here, but leave it open for the Court of Appeal on remand initially to decide that question on it review of the Superior Court\'s judgment.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
