The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 provides for fixing minimum wages and maximum hours for employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce, with increased compensation for overtime, and forbids, under pain of fine and imprisonment:  (1) violation by an employer of such wage and hour provisions; (2) shipment by him in interstate commerce of any goods in the production of which any employee was employed in violation of such provisions, and (3) failure of the employer to keep such records of his employees and of their wages and hours, as shall be prescribed by administrative regulation or order.  <em>Held</em> within the commerce power and consistent with the Fifth and Tenth Amendments.

Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from it articles whose use in the State for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the State has not sought to regulate their use.

S. 108</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The two principal questions raised by the record in this case are, first, whether Congress has constitutional power to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of lumber manufactured by employees whose wages are less than a prescribed minimum or whose weekly hours of labor at that wage are greater than a prescribed maximum, and, second, whether it has power to prohibit the employment of workmen in the production of goods "for interstate commerce" at other than prescribed wages and hours.  A subsidiary question is whether, in connection with such prohibitions, Congress can require the employer subject to them to keep records showing the hours worked each day and week by each of his employees including those engaged "in the production and manufacture of goods, to-wit, lumber, for <em>interstate commerce.\'"\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellee demurred to an indictment found in the district court for southern Georgia charging him with violation of \xc2\xa7 15(a)(1)(2) and (5) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 201, <em>et seq.</em>  The district court sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment, and the case comes here on direct appeal under \xc2\xa7 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 312 U. S. 109</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 345, and \xc2\xa7 682, Title 18 U.S.C. 34 Stat. 1246, which authorizes an appeal to this Court when the judgment sustaining the demurrer "is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded."</p>\n<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act set up a comprehensive legislative scheme for preventing the shipment in interstate commerce of certain products and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions as respects wages and hours which fail to conform to standards set up by the Act.  Its purpose, as we judicially know from the declaration of policy in \xc2\xa7 2(a) of the Act, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and the reports of Congressional committees proposing the legislation, S.Rept. No. 884, 75th Cong. 1st Sess.; H.Rept. No. 1452, 75th Cong. 1st Sess.; H.Rept. No. 2182, 75th Cong.3d Sess., Conference Report, H.Rept. No. 2738, 75th Cong.3d Sess., is to exclude from interstate commerce goods produced for the commerce and to prevent their production for interstate commerce under conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standards of living necessary for health and general wellbeing, and to prevent the use of interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 312 U. S. 110</a></p><p> commerce as the means of competition in the distribution of goods so produced, and as the means of spreading and perpetuating such substandard labor conditions among the workers of the several states.  The Act also sets up an administrative procedure whereby those standards may from time to time be modified generally as to industries subject to the Act or within an industry in accordance with specified standards, by an administrator acting in collaboration with "Industry Committees" appointed by him.</p>\n<p>Section 15 of the statute prohibits certain specified acts, and \xc2\xa7 16(a) punishes willful violation of it by a fine of not more than $10,000, and punishes each conviction after the first by imprisonment of not more than six months or by the specified fine, or both.  Section 15(1) makes unlawful the shipment in interstate commerce of any goods "in the production of which any employee was employed in violation of section 6 or section 7," which provide, among other things, that, during the first year of operation of the Act, a minimum wage of 25 cents per hour shall be paid to employees "engaged in [interstate] commerce or the production of goods for [interstate] commerce," \xc2\xa7 6, and that the maximum hours of employment for employees "engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce" without increased compensation for overtime, shall be forty-four hours a week.  \xc2\xa7 7.</p>\n<p>Section 15(a)(2) makes it unlawful to violate the provisions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 7, including the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements just mentioned for employees engaged in production of goods for commerce.  Section 15(a)(5) makes it unlawful for an employer subject to the Act to violate \xc2\xa7 11(c), which requires him to keep such records of the persons employed by him and of their wages and hours of employment as the administrator shall prescribe by regulation or order. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 312 U. S. 111</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The indictment charges that appellee is engaged, in the State of Georgia, in the business of acquiring raw materials, which he manufactures into finished lumber with the intent, when manufactured, to ship it in interstate commerce to customers outside the state, and that he does, in fact, so ship a large part of the lumber so produced.  There are numerous counts charging appellee with the shipment in interstate commerce from Georgia to points outside the state of lumber in the production of which, for interstate commerce, appellee has employed workmen at less than the prescribed minimum wage or more than the prescribed maximum hours without payment to them of any wage for overtime.  Other counts charge the employment by appellee of workmen in the production of lumber for interstate commerce at wages at less than 25 cents an hour or for more than the maximum hours per week without payment to them of the prescribed overtime wage.  Still another count charges appellee with failure to keep records showing the hours worked each day a week by each of his employees as required by \xc2\xa7 11(c) and the regulation of the administrator, Title 29, Ch. 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 516, and also that appellee unlawfully failed to keep such records of employees engaged "in the production and manufacture of goods, to-wit lumber, for interstate commerce."</p>\n<p>The demurrer, so far as now relevant to the appeal, challenged the validity of the Fair Labor Standards Act under the Commerce Clause and the Fifth and Tenth Amendments.  The district court quashed the indictment in its entirety upon the broad grounds that the Act, which it interpreted as a regulation of manufacture within the states, is unconstitutional.  It declared that manufacture is not interstate commerce, and that the regulation by the Fair Labor Standards Act of wages and hours of employment of those engaged in the manufacture </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 312 U. S. 112</a></p><p> of goods which it is intended at the time of production "may or will be" after production "sold in interstate commerce in part or in whole" is not within the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The effect of the court\'s decision and judgment is thus to deny the power of Congress to prohibit shipment in interstate commerce of lumber produced for interstate commerce under the proscribed substandard labor conditions of wages and hours, its power to penalize the employer for his failure to conform to the wage and hour provisions in the case of employees engaged in the production of lumber which he intends thereafter to ship in interstate commerce in part or in whole according to the normal course of his business, and its power to compel him to keep records of hours of employment as required by the statute and the regulations of the administrator.</p>\n<p>The case comes here on assignments by the Government that the district court erred insofar as it held that Congress was without constitutional power to penalize the acts set forth in the indictment, and appellee seeks to sustain the decision below on the grounds that the prohibition by Congress of those Acts is unauthorized by the Commerce Clause and is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.  The appeal statute limits our jurisdiction on this appeal to a review of the determination of the district court so far only as it is based on the validity or construction of the statute.  <em>United States v. Borden Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/188/case.html">308 U. S. 188</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/188/case.html#193">308 U. S. 193</a></span>-195, and cases cited.  Hence, we accept the district court\'s interpretation of the indictment and confine our decision to the validity and construction of the statute.</p>\n<p>The prohibition of shipment of the proscribed goods in interstate commerce.  Section 15(a)(1) prohibits, and the indictment charges, the shipment in interstate commerce, of goods produced for interstate commerce by employees whose wages and hours of employment do not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 312 U. S. 113</a></p><p> conform to the requirements of the Act.  Since this section is not violated unless the commodity shipped has been produced under labor conditions prohibited by \xc2\xa7 6 and \xc2\xa7 7, the only question arising under the commerce clause with respect to such shipments is whether Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit them.</p>\n<p>While manufacture is not, of itself, interstate commerce, the shipment of manufactured goods interstate is such commerce, and the prohibition of such shipment by Congress is indubitably a regulation of the commerce.  The power to regulate commerce is the power "to prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html">Gibbons v.

Co., supra.</em>  Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from the commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the state has not sought to regulate their use.  <em>Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, supra; Hoke v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p>Such regulation is not a forbidden invasion of state power merely because either its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of commerce within the states of destination, and is not prohibited unless by other Constitutional provisions.  It is no objection to the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.  <em>Seven Cases v.

Fenno,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 533.  Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause.  Subject only to that limitation, presently to be considered, we conclude that the prohibition of the shipment interstate of goods produced under the forbidden substandard labor conditions is within the constitutional authority of Congress.</p>\n<p>In the more than a century which has elapsed since the decision of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden,</em> these principles of constitutional interpretation have been so long and repeatedly recognized by this Court as applicable to the Commerce Clause that there would be little occasion for repeating them now were it not for the decision of this Court twenty-two years ago in <em>Hammer v. Dagenhart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/247/251/case.html">247 U. S. 251</a></span>.  In that case, it was held by a bare majority of the Court, over the powerful and now classic dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes setting forth the fundamental issues involved, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 312 U. S. 116</a></p><p> that Congress was without power to exclude the products of child labor from interstate commerce.  The reasoning and conclusion of the Court\'s opinion there cannot be reconciled with the conclusion which we have reached, that the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause is plenary to exclude any article from interstate commerce subject only to the specific prohibitions of the Constitution.</p>\n<p><em>Hammer v. Dagenhart</em> has not been followed.  The distinction on which the decision was rested, that Congressional power to prohibit interstate commerce is limited to articles which in themselves have some harmful or deleterious property -- a distinction which was novel when made and unsupported by any provision of the Constitution -- has long since been abandoned.  <em>Brooks v. United States, supra; Kentucky Whip &amp; Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra; Electric Bond &amp; Share Co. v.

The thesis of the opinion -- that the motive of the prohibition or its effect to control in some measure the use or production within the states of the article thus excluded from the commerce can operate to deprive the regulation of its constitutional authority -- has long since ceased to have force.  <em>Reid v.

Dagenhart</em> was a departure from the principles which have prevailed in the interpretation of the Commerce Clause both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 312 U. S. 117</a></p><p> before and since the decision, and that such vitality, as a precedent, as it then had, has long since been exhausted.  It should be, and now is, overruled.</p>\n<p><em>Validity of the wage and hour requirements.</em>  Section 15(a)(2) and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 7 require employers to conform to the wage and hour provisions with respect to all employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce.  As appellee\'s employees are not alleged to be "engaged in interstate commerce," the validity of the prohibition turns on the question whether the employment, under other than the prescribed labor standards, of employees engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce is so related to the commerce, and so affects it, as to be within the reach of the power of Congress to regulate it.</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must at the outset determine whether the particular acts charged in the counts which are laid under \xc2\xa7 15(a)(2) as they were construed below constitute "production for commerce" within the meaning of the statute.  As the Government seeks to apply the statute in the indictment, and as the court below construed the phrase "produced for interstate commerce," it embraces at least the case where an employer engaged, as is appellee, in the manufacture and shipment of goods in filling orders of extrastate customers, manufactures his product with the intent or expectation that, according to the normal course of his business, all or some part of it will be selected for shipment to those customers.</p>\n<p>Without attempting to define the precise limits of the phrase, we think the acts alleged in the indictment are within the sweep of the statute.  The obvious purpose of the Act was not only to prevent the interstate transportation of the proscribed product, but to stop the initial step toward transportation, production with the purpose of so transporting it.  Congress was not unaware that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 312 U. S. 118</a></p><p> most manufacturing businesses shipping their product in interstate commerce make it in their shops without reference to its ultimate destination, and then, after manufacture, select some of it for shipment interstate and some intrastate, according to the daily demands of their business, and that it would be practically impossible, without disrupting manufacturing businesses, to restrict the prohibited kind of production to the particular pieces of lumber, cloth, furniture or the like which later move in interstate, rather than intrastate, commerce.  <em>Cf. United States v. New York Central R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/457/case.html">272 U. S. 457</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/457/case.html#464">272 U. S. 464</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The recognized need of drafting a workable statute and the well known circumstances in which it was to be applied are persuasive of the conclusion, which the legislative history supports, S.Rept. No. 884, 75th Cong. 1st Sess., pp. 7 and 8; H.Rept. No. 2738, 75th Cong.3d Sess., p. 17, that the "production for commerce" intended includes at least production of goods which, at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in interstate commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>There remains the question whether such restriction on the production of goods for commerce is a permissible exercise of the commerce power.  The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states.  It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 312 U.

But, long before the adoption of the National Labor Relations Act, this Court had many times held that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to the regulation through legislative action of activities intrastate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 312 U. S. 120</a></p><p> which have a substantial effect on the commerce or the exercise of the Congressional power over it. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In such legislation, Congress has sometimes left it to the courts to determine whether the intrastate activities have the prohibited effect on the commerce, as in the Sherman Act.  It has sometimes left it to an administrative board or agency to determine whether the activities sought to be regulated or prohibited have such effect, as in the case of the Interstate Commerce Act and the National Labor Relations Act, or whether they come within the statutory definition of the prohibited Act, as in the Federal Trade Commission Act.  And sometimes Congress itself has said that a particular activity affects the commerce, as it did in the present Act, the Safety Appliance Act, and the Railway Labor Act.  In passing on the validity of legislation of the class last mentioned, the only function of courts is to determine whether the particular activity regulated or prohibited is within the reach </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 312 U. S. 121</a></p><p> of the federal power.  <em>See United States v. Ferger, supra; Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/515/case.html">300 U.

S. 553</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Congress having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end even though they involve control of intrastate activities.  Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers other than the commerce power granted to the national government when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government.  <em>See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v.

As we have said, the evils aimed at by the Act are the spread of substandard labor conditions through the use of the facilities of interstate commerce for competition by the goods so produced with those produced under the prescribed or better labor conditions, and the consequent dislocation of the commerce itself caused by the impairment or destruction of local businesses by competition made effective through interstate commerce.  The Act is thus directed at the suppression of a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has, in effect, condemned as "unfair," as the Clayton Act has condemned other "unfair methods of competition" made effective through interstate commerce.  <em>See Van Camp &amp; Sons Co. v.

There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment, or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.   <em>See e.g.,</em> II Elliot\'s Debates, 123, 131; III <em>id.</em> 450, 464, 600; IV <em>id.</em> 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1907-1908.</p>\n<p>From the beginning and for many years, the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/304/case.html">Martin v.

Since, as we have held, Congress may require production for interstate commerce to conform to those conditions, it may require the employer, as a means of enforcing the valid law, to keep a record showing whether he has, in fact, complied with it.  The requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end.  <em>See Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v.
