Ibid. Of course, if the question presented by an appeal is plainly insubstantial or directly governed by a controlling decision of this Court, summary disposition would still be appropriate. Since we do not believe that this can be said of this case, we would give plenary consideration to this appeal. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 381 U.S. 414, 415</a></p><p></p><p> <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1945649">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court </h2><h3> KENNECOTT COPPER CORP. v.
