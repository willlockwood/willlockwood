The justice decided against him.  Under such circumstances, he should have taken an appeal to the district court under \xc2\xa7 3358 of the New Mexican Code, which provides that "an appeal shall be allowed to the district court in all cases wherein judgment may be hereafter rendered in forcible entry and unlawful detainer, or both."
