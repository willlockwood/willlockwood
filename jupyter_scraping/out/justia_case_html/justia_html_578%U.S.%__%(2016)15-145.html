Even stronger evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred here is found in the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s historical meaning.

And the term \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d has, since the beginnings of bankruptcy practice, been used to describe asset transfers that, like Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 scheme, impair a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to collect a debt. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">One of the first bankruptcy Acts, the Fraudulent Conveyances Act of 1571, 13 Eliz., ch. 5, identified as \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d conveyances made with \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntent to delay hynder or defraude [c]reditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  The degree to which that statute remains embedded in fraud-related laws today, see, <i>e.g., BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 531\n, clarifies that the common-law term \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d is broad enough to incorporate fraudulent conveyances.  The common law also indicates that fraudulent conveyances do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor, see <i>id.</i>, at 541, as they lie not in dishonestly inducing a creditor to extend a debt but in the acts of concealment and hindrance.

Nor does this interpretation create a redundancy in \xc2\xa7727(a)(2), which is meaningfully different from \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  It is also not incompatible with \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Even though the transferor of a fraudulent conveyance does not obtain assets or debts through the fraudulent conveyance, the transferee\xe2\x80\x94who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud\xe2\x80\x94does.  At minimum, those debts would not be dischargeable under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  Finally, reading the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d to restrict, rather than expand, the discharge exception\xe2\x80\x99s reach would untenably require reading the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cby.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">787 F.\xc2\xa03d 312, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-H">Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

We granted certiorari to resolve that split and now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Husky International Electronics, Inc., is a Colorado-based supplier of components used in electronic devices.  Between 2003 and 2007, Husky sold its products to Chrysalis Manufacturing Corp., and Chrysalis incurred a debt to Husky of $163,999.38.  During the same period, respondent Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr., served as a director of Chrysalis and owned at least 30% of Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 common stock.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All parties agree that between 2006 and 2007, Ritz drained Chrysalis of assets it could have used to pay its debts to creditors like Husky by transferring large sums of Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 funds to other entities Ritz controlled.  For instance\xe2\x80\x94and Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 actions were by no means limited to these examples\xe2\x80\x94Ritz transferred $52,600 to CapNet Risk Management, Inc., a company he owned in full; $121,831 to CapNet Securities Corp., a company in which he owned an 85% interest; and $99,386.90 to Dynalyst Manufacturing Corp., a company in which he owned a 25% interest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In May 2009, Husky filed a lawsuit against Ritz seek-ing to hold him personally responsible for Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 $163,999.38 debt.  Husky argued that Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 intercompany-transfer scheme was \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of a Texas law that allows creditors to hold shareholders responsible for corporate debt.  See Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code Ann. \xc2\xa721.223(b) (West 2012).  In December 2009, Ritz filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.  Husky then initiated an adversarial proceeding in Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 bankruptcy case again seeking to hold Ritz personally liable for Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 debt.  Husky also contended that Ritz could not discharge that debt in bankruptcy because the same intercompany-transfer scheme constituted \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d under\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption to discharge.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court held that Ritz was personally liable for the debt under Texas law, but that the debt was not \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. actual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) and could be discharged in his bankruptcy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  It did not address whether Ritz was responsible for Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 debt under Texas law because it agreed with the District Court that Ritz did not commit \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  Before the Fifth Circuit, Husky argued that Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 asset-transfer scheme was effectuated through a series of fraudulent conveyances\xe2\x80\x94or transfers intended to obstruct the collection of debt.  And, Husky said, such transfers are a recognizable form of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Fifth Circuit dis-agreed, holding that a necessary element of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d is a misrepresentation from the debtor to the creditor, as when a person applying for credit adds an extra zero to her income or falsifies her employment history.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Ritz</i>, 787 F.\xc2\xa03d 312, 316 (2015).  In transferring Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 assets, Ritz may have hindered Husky\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recover its debt, but the Fifth Circuit found that he did not make any false representations to Husky regarding those assets or the transfers and therefore did not commit \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reverse.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) encompasses forms of fraud, like fraudulent conveyance schemes, that can be effected without a false representation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Before 1978, the Bankruptcy Code prohibited debtors from discharging debts obtained by \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses or false representations.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa735(a)(2) (1976 ed.).  In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Congress added \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d to that list.\n\n92Stat.\n2590.  The prohibition now reads: \xe2\x80\x9cA discharge under [Chapters 7, 11, 12, or 13] of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) (2012 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Quality Stores, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7).  It is therefore sensible to start with the presumption that Congress did not intend \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d to mean the same thing as \xe2\x80\x9ca false representation,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding suggests.  But the historical meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d provides even stronger evidence that the phrase has long encompassed the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred here: a transfer scheme designed to hinder the collection of debt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has historically construed the terms in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) to contain the \xe2\x80\x9celements that the common law has defined them to include.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Field </i>v.<i> Mans</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59,\n69 (1995)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cActual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d has two parts: actual and fraud.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cactual\xe2\x80\x9d has a simple meaning in the context of common-law fraud: It denotes any fraud that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[es] moral turpitude or intentional wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Neal </i>v.<i> Clark</i>,\n\n95 U.\xc2\xa0S. 704,\n709 (1878)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cActual\xe2\x80\x9d fraud stands in contrast to \xe2\x80\x9cimplied\xe2\x80\x9d fraud or fraud \xe2\x80\x9cin law,\xe2\x80\x9d which describe acts of deception that \xe2\x80\x9cmay exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, anything that counts as \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d and is done with wrongful intent is \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d connotes deception or trickery gener-ally, the term is difficult to define more precisely.  See 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7189, p. 221<i> </i>(6th ed. 1853) (Story) (\xe2\x80\x9cFraud .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. being so various in its nature, and so extensive in its application to human concerns, it would be difficult to enumerate all the instances in which Courts of Equity will grant relief under this head\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no need to adopt a definition for all times and all circumstances here because, from the beginning of English bankruptcy practice, courts and legislatures have used the term \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s transfer of assets that, like Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 scheme, impairs a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to collect the debt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One of the first bankruptcy acts, the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, has long been relied upon as a restatement of the law of so-called fraudulent conveyances (also known as \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent transfers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent alienations\xe2\x80\x9d).  See generally<i> </i>G. Glenn, The Law of Fraudulent Conveyances 89\xe2\x80\x9392 (1931).  That statute, also called the Fraudulent Conveyances Act of 1571, identified as fraud \xe2\x80\x9cfaigned covenous and fraudulent Feoffmentes Gyftes Grauntes Alienations [and] Conveyaunces\xe2\x80\x9d made with \xe2\x80\x9cIntent to delaye hynder or defraude Creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Eliz. ch. 5.  In modern terms, Parliament made it fraudulent to hide assets from creditors by giving them to one\xe2\x80\x99s family, friends, or associates.  The principles of the Statute of 13 Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x94and even some of its language\xe2\x80\x94continue to be in wide use today.  See<i> BFP</i> v. <i>Resolution Trust Corporation</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 531,\n540 (1994)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe modern law of fraudulent transfers had its origin in the Statute of 13 Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>at 541 (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery American bankruptcy law has incorporated a fraudulent transfer provision\xe2\x80\x9d); Story \xc2\xa7353, at 393  (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he statute of 13 Elizabeth .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has been universally adopted in America, as the basis of our jurisprudence on the same subject\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Boston Trading Group, Inc. </i>v.<i> Burnazos</i>, 835 F.\xc2\xa02d 1504, 1505\xe2\x80\x931506 (CA1 1987) (Breyer, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cMass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9313 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a uniform state law that codifies both common and statutory law stretching back at least to 1571 and the Statute of Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x9d).  The degree to which this statute remains embedded in laws related to fraud today clarifies that thecommon-law term \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d is broad enough toincorporate a fraudulent conveyance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Equally important, the common law also indicates that fraudulent conveyances, although a \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor.  As a basic point, fraudulent conveyances are not an inducement-based fraud.  Fraudulent conveyances typically involve \xe2\x80\x9ca transfer to a close relative, a secret transfer, a transfer of title without transfer of possession, or grossly inadequate consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BFP</i>, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 540\xe2\x80\x93541 (citing <i>Twyne\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 3 Co. Rep. 80b, 76 Eng. Rep. 809 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1601)); O. Bump, Fraudulent Conveyances: A Treatise Upon Conveyances Made by Debtors To Defraud Creditors 31\xe2\x80\x9360 (3d ed. 1882)).  In such cases, the fraudulent conduct is not in dishonestly inducing a creditor to extend a debt.  It is in the acts of concealment and hindrance.  In the fraudulent-conveyance context, therefore, the opportunities for a false representation from the debtor to the creditor are limited.  The debtor may have the opportunity to put forward a false representation if the creditor inquires into the whereabouts of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets, but that could hardly be considered a defining feature of this kind of fraud.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Relatedly, under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and the laws that followed, both the debtor and the recipient of the conveyed assets were liable for fraud even though the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance of course made no representation, true or false, to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s creditor.  The famous <i>Twyne\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, which this Court relied upon in <i>BFP</i>,<i> </i>illustrates this point.  See <i>Twyne\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 76 Eng. Rep., at 823 (convicting Twyne of fraud under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, even though he was the recipient of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s conveyance).  That principle underlies the now-common understanding that a \xe2\x80\x9cconveyance which hinders, delays or defrauds creditors shall be void as against [the recipient] unless .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. th[at] party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. received it in good faith and for consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Glenn, Law of Fraudulent Conveyances \xc2\xa7233, at 312.  That principle also underscores the point that a false representation has never been a required element of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d and we decline to adopt it as one today.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Ritz concedes that fraudulent conveyances are a formof \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] but contends that\n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s particular use of the phrase means something else.  Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 strained reading of the provision finds little support.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, Ritz contends that interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) to encompass fraudulent conveyances would render duplicative two other exceptions to discharge in \xc2\xa7523.  Section 523(a)(4) exempts from discharge \xe2\x80\x9cany debt .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa7523(a)(6) exempts \xe2\x80\x9cany debt .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ritz makes the unremarkable point that the traditional definition of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d will cover some of the same conduct as those exceptions: for example, a trustee who fraudulently conveys away his trust\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  But Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation does not avoid duplication, nor does our interpretation fail to preserve a meaningful difference between \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(4), (6).  Just as a fiduciary who engages in a fraudulent conveyance may find his debt exempted from discharge under either \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) or \xc2\xa7523(a)(4), so too would a fiduciary who engages in one of the fraudulent misrepresentations that form the core of Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 preferred interpretation of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A). The same is true for \xc2\xa7523(a)(6).  The debtors who commit fraudulent conveyances <i>and </i>the debtors who make false representations under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) could likewise also inflict \xe2\x80\x9cwillful and malicious injury\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7523(a)(6).  There is, in short, overlap, but that overlap appears inevitable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And, of course, our interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) also preserves meaningful distinctions between that provision and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(4), (a)(6).  Section 523(a)(4), for instance, covers only debts for fraud while acting as a fiduciary, whereas \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) has no similar limitation.  Nothing in our interpretation alters that distinction.  And \xc2\xa7523(a)(6) covers debts \xe2\x80\x9cfor willful and malicious injury,\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not that injury is the result of fraud, see<i> Kawaauhau </i>v.<i> Geiger</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57,\n61 (1998)\n (discussing injuries resulting from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intentional torts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), whereas  \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) covers only fraudulent acts.  Nothing in our interpretation alters that distinction either.  Thus, given the clear differences between these provisions, we see no reason to craft an artificial definition of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d merely to avoid narrow redundancies in \xc2\xa7523 that appear unavoidable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ritz also says that our interpretation creates redun-dancy with a separate section of the Bankruptcy Code, \xc2\xa7727(a)(2), which prevents a debtor from discharging all of his debts if, within the year preceding the bankruptcy petition, he \xe2\x80\x9ctransferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed\xe2\x80\x9d property \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate charged with custody of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the two provisions could cover some of the same conduct, they are meaningfully different.  Section 727(a)(2) is broader than \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) in scope\xe2\x80\x94preventing an offending debtor from discharging all debt in bankruptcy.  But it is narrower than \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) in timing\xe2\x80\x94applying only if the debtor fraudulently conveys assets in the year preceding the bank-ruptcy filing.  In short, while \xc2\xa7727(a)(2) is a blunt remedy for actions that hinder the entire bankruptcy process, \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) is a tailored remedy for behavior connected to specific debts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ritz\xe2\x80\x99 next point of resistance rests on \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the relevant debt be \xe2\x80\x9cfor money, prop-erty, services, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. credit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>obtained by</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. actual fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The argument, which the dissent also emphasizes, has two parts: First, it posits that fraudulent conveyances (unlike other forms of actual fraud) cannot be used to \xe2\x80\x9cobtai[n]\xe2\x80\x9d debt because they function instead to hide valuables that a debtor already possesses.  Brief for Respondent 20, 31.  There is, the dissent says, no debt at the end of a fraudulent conveyance that could be said to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98resul[t] from\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traceable to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the fraud.  <i>Post,</i> at 3 (quoting <i>Field</i>, 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61, 64). <i> </i>Second, it urges that \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d not be interpreted to encompass forms of fraud that are incompatible with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is of course true that the transferor does not \xe2\x80\x9cobtai[n]\xe2\x80\x9d debts in a fraudulent conveyance.  But the recipient of the transfer\xe2\x80\x94who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud\xe2\x80\x94can \xe2\x80\x9cobtai[n]\xe2\x80\x9d assets \xe2\x80\x9cby\xe2\x80\x9d his or her participation in the fraud.  See, <i>e.g</i>., <i>McClellan </i>v<i>. Cantrell</i>, 217 F.\xc2\xa03d 890 (CA 7 2000); see also<i> supra,</i> at 6.

Thus, at least sometimes a debt \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d a fraudulent conveyance scheme could be nondischargeable under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  Such circumstances may be rare because a person who receives fraudulently conveyed assets is not necessarily (or even likely to be) a debtor on the verge of bankruptcy,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] but they make clear that fraudulent conveyances are not wholly incompatible with the \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent presses further still, contending that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. actual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d requires not only that the relevant debts \xe2\x80\x9cresul[t] from\xe2\x80\x9d or be \xe2\x80\x9ctraceable to\xe2\x80\x9d fraud but also that they \xe2\x80\x9cresult from fraud <i>at the inception of a credit transaction</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 3 (emphasis added).  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) supports that additional requirement.  The dissent bases its conclusion on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Field</i>, in which the Court noted that certain forms of bankruptcy fraud require a degreeof direct reliance by a creditor on an action taken by a debtor.  But <i>Field </i>discussed such \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d only in setting forth the requirements of the form of fraud alleged in that case\xe2\x80\x94namely, fraud perpetrated through a misrepresentation to a creditor.  See<i> </i>516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61.  The Court was not establishing a \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d requirement for frauds that are not premised on such a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Ritz argues that Congress added the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) not to expand the exception\xe2\x80\x99s reach, but to restrict it.

There are two types of fraudulent transfer schemes: \xe2\x80\x9ctransfers made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, referred to as actual fraudulent transfers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransfers made for less than reasonably equivalent value when a debtor was in financial trouble, [which is] referred to as constructive fraudulent transfers.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Bankruptcy Law Manual \xc2\xa79A:29, p. 333 (5th ed. 2015).

In my view, context dictates that \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily does not include fraudulent transfers because \xe2\x80\x9cthat meaning does not fit\xe2\x80\x9d with the rest of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2).  <i>Castleman</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 523(a)(2) covers only situations in which \xe2\x80\x9cmoney, property, [or] services\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. actualfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d and results in a debt.  See <i>Cohen </i>v. <i>de la Cruz</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213,\n218 (1998)\n.  The statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d is an important limitation on the reach of the provision.  Section 523(a)(2)(A) applies only when the fraudulent conduct occurs at the <i>inception of the debt</i>, <i>i.e., </i>when<i> </i>the debtor commits a fraudulent act to induce the creditor to part with his money, property, services, or credit.  The logical conclusion then is that \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as it is used in the statute\xe2\x80\x94covers only those situations in which some sort of fraudulent conduct caused the creditor to enter into a transaction with the debtor.  A fraudulent transfer generally does not fit that mold, unless, perhaps, the fraudulent transferor and the fraudulent transferee conspired to fraudulently drain the assets of the creditor.  But the fraudulent transfer here, like all but the rarest fraudulent transfers, did not trick the creditor into selling his goods to the buyer, Chrysalis Manufacturing Corporation.  It follows that the goods that resulted in the debt here were not \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d actual fraud.  \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I reach this conclusion based on the plain meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by,\xe2\x80\x9d which has an \xe2\x80\x9cinherent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9celement of causation,\xe2\x80\x9d and refers to those debts \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctraceable to\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.  <i>Field </i>v.<i> Mans</i>,\n\n516 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59,\n61,\n64,\n66 (1995)\n.

As the majority notes, the debt at issue did not originate from any transaction between Ritz and Husky.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.<i> </i>Instead, Husky sold goods to Chrysalis, a company that Ritz financially controlled.  <i>Ibid</i>.<i> </i>In turn,<i> </i>Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x94not Ritz\xe2\x80\x94incurred a debt to Husky of $163,999.38 for the goods.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.

In fact, the only communication between Ritz and Husky occurred after Husky and Chrysalis entered into the contract and after Husky had shipped the goods to Chrysalis.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Bankruptcy Court also found that there was no evidence that Ritz transferred the funds to avoid Chrysalis\xe2\x80\x99 obligations to pay the debt it owed to Husky\xe2\x80\x94an unsecured creditor.  <i>Id.,</i> at 635.  Because Husky does not contend that Ritz fraudulently induced it to sell goods to Chrysalis and cannot show that the constructive fraudulent conveyance had anything to do with its decision to contract with Chrysalis, Husky has not established that \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(a) covers any debt owed to it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority reaches the opposite conclusion and holds that \xc2\xa7523(a)(2) may prevent an individual debtor from obtaining a discharge even if (1) the debtor makes no false representation to the creditor, (2) the creditor does not rely on any of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actions or inactions, and (3)\xc2\xa0there was no actual fraudulent conveyance at the inception of the credit transaction between the creditor and the debtor.  <i>Ante</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 9.  It does so by giving new meaning to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d in cases involv-ing fraudulent transfers, disregarding our case law, and second-guessing Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choices.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority admits that a transferor \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not \xe2\x80\x98obtai[n]\xe2\x80\x99 debts in a fraudulent conveyance,\xe2\x80\x9d but contends that \xe2\x80\x9cthe recipient of the transfer\xe2\x80\x94who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud\xe2\x80\x94can \xe2\x80\x98obtain\xe2\x80\x99 assets \xe2\x80\x98by\xe2\x80\x99 his or her participation in the fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (brackets omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cIf that recipient later files for bankruptcy, any debts trace-able to the fraudulent conveyance,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority states, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be nondischargable under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).  The majority thus holds that \xe2\x80\x9cat least sometimes a debt \xe2\x80\x98obtained by\xe2\x80\x99 a fraudulent conveyance scheme could be nondischargeable under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) does not exempt from discharge any debts \xe2\x80\x9ctraceable to the fraudulent conveyance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) exempts from discharge \xe2\x80\x9cany debt for\xe2\x80\x9d goods that are \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d actual fraud.  And, as explained, it is extremely rare that a creditor will use an actual fraudulent transfer scheme to induce a creditor to depart with property, services, money, or credit.  See <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In reaching its conclusion, the majority also disregards this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents interpreting \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), presumably because those cases did not involve fraudulent transfers.  The majority cites <i>Field</i> only for the elemental proposition that this Court \xe2\x80\x9chas historically construed the terms in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) to contain the \xe2\x80\x98elements that the common law has defined them to include.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 4 (quoting 516 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 69).  The majority omits <i>Field</i>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that one of the elements of \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) is \xe2\x80\x9c<i>reliance</i>\xe2\x80\x9d on some sort of false statement, misrepresentation, or omission.  <i>Id</i>., at 70 (emphasis added).  To be sure, like the rest of our cases interpreting \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), <i>Field</i> involves a false statement.  But that factual distinction is immaterial.  Cases like <i>Field</i>\xe2\x80\x94which interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are as relevant in cases that involve false statements and misrepresentations as they are in a case like this one.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d modifies false pretenses, false representations, and actual fraud in \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  And in no case has this Court suggested\xe2\x80\x94never mind held\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) may apply to circumstances in which there was no false statement, misrepresentation, or omission when the debt was first obtained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority ostensibly creates a new definition of \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d because it thinks that this move is necessary to avoid rendering \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d superfluous.  See <i>ante, </i>at 4, 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Not so.  Actual fraud is broader than false pretenses or false representations, and \xe2\x80\x9cconsists of any deceit, artifice, trick, or design involving direct and active operation of the mind, used to circumvent and cheat another.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6523.08[1][e], at 523\xe2\x80\x9346.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnlike false pretenses or false representation, actual fraud, within the meaning of the dischargeability exception, can focuson a promise of future performance made with intent not to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  2F Bankruptcy Service \xc2\xa727:211, p. 59 (Supp. Jan. 2016).  In this way, \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual fraud\xe2\x80\x9d exception \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[s] the courts to except from discharge debts incurred without intent to repay, or by use of other false implied representations, without the need to stretch the false pretenses and false representations language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Zaretsky, The Fraud Exception to Discharge Under the New Bankruptcy Code, 53 Am. Bankruptcy L.\xc2\xa0J. 253, 257 (1979).  Some courts, for example, have held that \xe2\x80\x9ca debtor commits actual fraud within the meaning of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) when he incurs credit card debt with no actual, subjective intent to repay it,\xe2\x80\x9d but has not made an affirmatively false representation or engaged in false pretense.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Morrow</i>, 488 B.\xc2\xa0R. 471, 479\xe2\x80\x93480 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ga. 2012); see also, <i>e.g., In re Alam</i>, 314 B.\xc2\xa0R. 834, 841 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ga. 2004).  Defining actual fraud this way does not render that term superfluous and\xe2\x80\x94unlike the majority\xe2\x80\x99s definition\xe2\x80\x94does not render \xe2\x80\x9cobtained by\xe2\x80\x9d a nullity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Regardless, even if there is some overlap between the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cfalse pretenses,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfalse representations,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cactual fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[r]edundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Connecticut Nat.

When Congress wants to stop a debtor from discharging a debt that he has concealed through a fraudulent transfer scheme, it ordinarily says so.  See \xc2\xa7727(a)(2) (stating that a court shall grant the debtor a discharge unless the debtor engages in an actual fraudulent transfer scheme within a certain time of filing a bankruptcy petition).  If Congress wanted \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) to cover fraudulent transfer situations, \xe2\x80\x9cit would have spoken more clearly to that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Staples </i>v.<i> United</i> <i>States</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600,\n620 (1994)\n.  Ultimately, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for us to substitute our view of policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Florida Dept. of Revenue </i>v.<i> Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33,\n52 (2008)\n (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority today departs from the plain language of \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), as interpreted by our precedents.  Because I find no support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in the text of the Bankruptcy Code, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
