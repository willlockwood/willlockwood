Appearing <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i>, Class asked the District Court to dismiss the indictment.  He alleged that the statute, \xc2\xa75104(e), violates the\n \nSecond Amendment and the Due Process Clause.  After the District Court dismissed both claims, Class pleaded guilty to \xe2\x80\x9cPossession of a Firearm on U.\xc2\xa0S.

A written plea agreement set forth the terms of Class\xe2\x80\x99 guilty plea, including several categories of rights that he agreed to waive.  The agreement said nothing about the right to challenge on direct appeal the constitutionality of the statute of conviction.  After conducting a hearing pursuant to Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the District Court accepted Class\xe2\x80\x99 guilty plea and sentenced him.  Soon thereafter, Class sought to raise his constitutional claims on direct appeal.  The Court of Appeals held that Class could not do so because, by pleading guilty, he had waived his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A guilty plea, by itself, does not bar a federal criminal defendant from challenging the constitutionality of his statute of conviction on direct appeal.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0This holding flows directly from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.  Fifty years ago, in <i>Haynes</i> v. <i>United States</i>, the Court addressed a similar claim challenging the constitutionality of a criminal statute.  Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court stated that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplea of guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitutional] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85\n, n.\xc2\xa02.  That clear statement reflects an understanding of the nature of guilty pleas that stretches, in broad outline, nearly 150 years.  Subsequent decisions have elaborated upon it.  In <i>Blackledge</i> v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21\n, the Court recognized that a guilty plea bars some \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98antecedent constitutional violations,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d related to events (such as grand jury proceedings) that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98occu[r] prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 30 (quoting <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson</i>,\n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n\xe2\x80\x93267).  However, where the claim implicates \xe2\x80\x9cthe very power of the State\xe2\x80\x9d to prosecute the defendant, a guilty plea cannot by itself bar it.  417 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30<i>.  </i>Likewise, in <i>Menna</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n423 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61\n, the Court held that because the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s claim was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State may not convict [him] no matter how validly his factual guilt is established,\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9cguilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 63, n.\xc2\xa02.  In more recent years, the Court has reaffirmed the <i>Menna-Blackledge</i> doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s basic teaching that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that\xe2\x80\x94judged on its face\xe2\x80\x94the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Broce</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563\n (quoting <i>Menna</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 63, n.\xc2\xa02).  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0In this case, Class neither expressly nor implicitly waived his constitutional claims by pleading guilty.  As this Court understands them, the claims at issue here do not contradict the terms of the indictment or the written plea agreement and they can be resolved \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of the existing record.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Broce</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 575.  Class challenges the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to criminalize his (admitted) conduct and thereby calls into question the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constitutionally prosecute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d him.  <i>Ibid. </i> (quoting <i>Menna</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362, n. 2).

By its own terms, the Rule does not say whether it sets forth the exclusive procedure for a defendant to preserve a constitutional claim following a guilty plea.  And the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s drafters acknowledged that the \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme Court has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised after a plea of guilty\xe2\x80\x9d and specifically stated that Rule 11(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9chas no application\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9ckinds of constitutional objections\xe2\x80\x9d that may be raised under the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Menna</i>-<i>Blackledge</i> doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on 1983 Amendments to Fed.

Soon thereafter, Class, appearing <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i>,<i> </i>asked the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss the indictment.

The Government agreed to drop related charges.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 31.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A written plea agreement set forth the terms of Class\xe2\x80\x99 guilty plea, including several categories of rights that he expressly agreed to waive.  Those express waivers included: (1)\xc2\xa0all defenses based upon the statute of limitations; (2)\xc2\xa0several specified trial rights; (3)\xc2\xa0the right to appeal a sentence at or below the judicially determined, maximum sentencing guideline range; (4)\xc2\xa0most collateral attacks on the conviction and sentence; and (5)\xc2\xa0various rights to request or receive information concerning the investigation and prosecution of his criminal case.  <i>Id</i>., at 38\xe2\x80\x9342.  At the same time, the plea agreement expressly enumerated categories of claims that Class could raise on appeal, including claims based upon (1)\xc2\xa0newly discovered evidence; (2)\xc2\xa0ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3)\xc2\xa0certain statutes providing for sentence reductions.  <i>Id.,</i> at 41.

See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ruiz</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622,\n629 (2002)\n (defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea must be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98voluntary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crelated waivers\xe2\x80\x9d must be made \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowing[ly], intelligent[ly], [and] with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  After providing Class with the required information and warnings, the District Court accepted his guilty plea.  Class was sentenced to 24 days imprisonment followed by 12 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Several days later, Class appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Class was appointed an <i>amicus</i> to aid him in presenting his arguments.  He repeated his constitutional claims, namely, that the statute violates the\n \nSecond Amendment and the Due Process Clause because it fails to give fair notice of which areas fall within the Capitol Grounds where firearms are banned.  The Court of Appeals held that Class could not raise his constitutional claims because, by pleading guilty, he had waived them.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\xe2\x80\x935a.  Class filed a petition for certiorari in this Court asking us to decide whether in pleading guilty a criminal defendant inherently waives the right to challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction.  We agreed to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The question is whether a guilty plea by itself bars a federal criminal defendant from challenging the constitutionality of the statute of conviction on direct appeal.  We hold that it does not.  Class did not relinquish his right to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional determinations simply by pleading guilty.  As we shall explain, this holding flows directly from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fifty years ago this Court directly addressed a similar claim (a claim that the statute of conviction was unconstitutional).  And the Court stated that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplea of guilty did not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. waive his previous [constitutional] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Haynes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85\n, n.\xc2\xa02 (1968).  Though Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court in <i>Haynes </i>offered little explanation for this statement, subsequent decisions offered a rationale that applies here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Blackledge </i>v.<i> Perry, </i>\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21 (1974)\n,<i> </i>North Carolina indicted and convicted Jimmy Seth Perry on a misdemeanor assault charge.  When Perry exercised his right under a North Carolina statute to a <i>de novo</i> trial in a higher court, the State reindicted him, but this time the State charged a felony, which carried a heavier penalty, for the same conduct.  Perry pleaded guilty.  He then sought habeas relief on the grounds that the reindictment amounted to an unconstitutional vindictive prosecution.  The State argued that Perry\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea barred him from raising his constitutional challenge.  But this Court held that it did not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court noted that a guilty plea bars appeal of many claims, including some \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98antecedent constitutional violations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d related to events (say, grand jury proceedings) that had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 30 (quoting <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson</i>,\n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n\xe2\x80\x93267 (1973)).  While <i>Tollett </i>claims were \xe2\x80\x9cof constitutional dimension,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the underlying constitutional infirmity is markedly different\xe2\x80\x9d from a claim of vindictive prosecution, which implicates \xe2\x80\x9cthe very power of the State\xe2\x80\x9d to prosecute the defendant.  <i>Blackledge</i>, 417 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30<i>.  </i>Accordingly, the Court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right\xe2\x80\x9d Perry \xe2\x80\x9casserts and that we today accept is the right not to be haled into court at all upon the felony charge\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he very initiation of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d against Perry \xe2\x80\x9coperated to deprive him due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A year and a half later, in <i>Menna </i>v.<i> New York, </i>\n\n423 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61 (1975)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), this Court repeated what it had said and held in <i>Blackledge.  </i>After Menna served a 30-day jail term for refusing to testify before the grand jury on November 7, 1968, the State of New York charged him once again for (what Menna argued was) the same crime.  Menna pleaded guilty, but subsequently appealed arguing that the new charge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 5.  The lower courts held that Menna\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim had been \xe2\x80\x9cwaived\xe2\x80\x9d by his guilty plea.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court reversed.  Citing <i>Blackledge</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 30, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that\xe2\x80\x94judged on its face\xe2\x80\x94the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Menna</i>, 423 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63, and n.\xc2\xa02.  Menna\xe2\x80\x99s claim amounted to a claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State may not convict\xe2\x80\x9d him \xe2\x80\x9cno matter how validly his factual guilt is established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Menna\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cguilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These holdings reflect an understanding of the nature of guilty pleas which, in broad outline, stretches back nearly 150 years.  In 1869 Justice Ames wrote for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe plea of guilty is, of course, a confession of all the facts charged in the indictment, and also of the evil intent imputed to the defendant.  It is a waiver also of all merely technical and formal objections of which the defendant could have availed himself by any other plea or motion.  But if the facts alleged and admitted do not constitute a crime against the laws of the Commonwealth, the defendant is entitled to be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Hinds</i>, 101 Mass. 209, 210.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Decisions of federal and state courts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries reflect a similar view of the nature of a guilty plea.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ury</i>, 106 F.\xc2\xa02d 28 (CA2 1939)<i> </i>(holding the \xe2\x80\x9cplea of guilty did not foreclose the appellant,\xe2\x80\x9d who argued that a statute was unconstitutional, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the review he now seeks\xe2\x80\x9d (citing earlier cases)); <i>Hocking Valley R.

We refer to these cases because it was against this background that Justice Harlan in his opinion for the Court made the statement to which we originally referred, namely, that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplea of guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitutional] claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Haynes</i>, 390 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 87, n.\xc2\xa02 (citing <i>Ury</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 28).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In more recent years, we have reaffirmed the <i>Menna- Blackledge </i>doctrine and refined its scope.  In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Broce</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563 (1989)\n, the defendants pleaded guilty to two separate indictments in a single proceeding which \xe2\x80\x9con their face\xe2\x80\x9d described two separate bid-rigging conspiracies.  <i>Id.,</i> at 576.  They later sought to challenge their convictions on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that they had only admitted to one conspiracy.  Citing <i>Blackledge </i>and <i>Menna</i>, this Court repeated that a guilty plea does not bar a claim on appeal \xe2\x80\x9cwhere on the face of the record the court had no power to enter the conviction or impose the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.  However, because the defendants could not \xe2\x80\x9cprove their claim by relying on those indictments and the existing record\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwithout contradicting those indictments,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court held that their claims were \xe2\x80\x9cforeclosed by the admissions inherent in their guilty pleas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 576.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the claims in <i>Broce, </i>Class\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims here, as we understand them, do not contradict the terms of the indictment or the written plea agreement.  They are consistent with Class\xe2\x80\x99 knowing, voluntary, and intelligent admission that he did what the indictment alleged.  Those claims can be \xe2\x80\x9cresolved without any need to venture beyond that record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 575.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do Class\xe2\x80\x99 claims focus upon case-related constitutional defects that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Blackledge</i>, 417 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30.  They could not, for example, \xe2\x80\x9chave been \xe2\x80\x98cured\xe2\x80\x99 through a new indictment by a properly selected grand jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(citing <i>Tollett</i>, 411 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267).  Because the defendant has admitted the charges against him, a guilty plea makes the latter kind of constitutional claim \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant to the constitutional validity of the conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Haring </i>v. <i>Prosise</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306,\n321 (1983)\n.<i> </i>But the cases to which we have referred make clear that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea does not make irrelevant the kind of constitutional claim Class seeks to make.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, the claims at issue here do not fall within any of the categories of claims that Class\xe2\x80\x99 plea agreement forbids him to raise on direct appeal.  They challenge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to criminalize Class\xe2\x80\x99 (admitted) conduct.  They thereby call into question the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constitutionally prosecute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d him.  <i>Broce</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 575 (quoting <i>Menna</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362, n.\xc2\xa02).  A guilty plea does not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We are not convinced by the three basic arguments that the Government and the dissent make in reply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>First</i>, the Government contends that by entering a guilty plea, Class inherently relinquished his constitutional claims.  The Government is correct that a guilty plea does implicitly waive some claims, including some constitutional claims.  However, as we explained in Part II, <i>supra</i>, Class\xe2\x80\x99 valid guilty plea does not, by itself, bar direct appeal of his constitutional claims in these circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As an initial matter, a valid guilty plea \xe2\x80\x9cforgoes not only a fair trial, but also other accompanying constitutional guarantees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ruiz</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 628\xe2\x80\x93629.  While those \xe2\x80\x9csimultaneously\xe2\x80\x9d relinquished rights include the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the jury trial right, and the right to confront accusers, <i>McCarthy</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 459,\n466 (1969)\n, they do not include \xe2\x80\x9ca waiver of the privileges which exist beyond the confines of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 314,\n324 (1999)\n.  Here, Class\xe2\x80\x99 statutory right directly to appeal his conviction \xe2\x80\x9ccannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lafler</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156,\n165 (2012)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A valid guilty plea also renders irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94and thereby prevents the defendant from appealing\xe2\x80\x94the constitutionality of case-related government conduct that takes place before the plea is entered.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Haring</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 320 (holding a valid guilty plea \xe2\x80\x9cresults in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s loss of any meaningful opportunity he might otherwise have had to challenge the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Neither can the defendant later complain that the indicting grand jury was unconstitutionally selected.  <i>Tollett</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 266.  But, as we have said, those kinds of claims are not at issue here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, a valid guilty plea relinquishes any claim that would contradict the \xe2\x80\x9cadmissions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Broce</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  But the constitutional claim at issue here is consistent with Class\xe2\x80\x99 admission that he engaged in the conduct alleged in the indictment.  Unlike the defendants in <i>Broce</i>, Class\xe2\x80\x99 challenge does not in any way deny that he engaged in the conduct to which he admitted.  Instead, like the defendants in <i>Blackledge</i> and <i>Menna</i>, he seeks to raise a claim which, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judged on its face\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d based upon the existing record, would extinguish the government\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constitutionally prosecute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant if the claim were successful.  <i>Broce</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 575 (quoting <i>Menna</i>, 423 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363, and n.\xc2\xa02).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Second</i>, the Government and the dissent point to Rule 11(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs \xe2\x80\x9cconditional\xe2\x80\x9d guilty pleas.  The Rule states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c<i>Conditional Plea.  </i>With the consent of the court and the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion.  A defendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw the plea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government and the dissent argue that Rule 11(a)(2) means that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant who pleads guilty <i>cannot </i>challenge his conviction on appeal on a forfeitable or  waivable ground that he either failed to present to the district court or failed to reserve in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 23; see also <i>post</i>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of Alito, J.).  They support this argument by pointing to the notes of the Advisory Committee that drafted the text of Rule 11(a)(2).  See Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on 1983 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 911 (hereinafter Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes).  In particular, the dissent points to the suggestion that an unconditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of \xe2\x80\x9cnonjurisdictional defects,\xe2\x80\x9d while the Government points to the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 statement that they intended the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconditional plea procedure .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to conserve prosecutorial and judicial resources and advance speedy trial objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d while ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cmuch needed uniformity in the federal system on this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vonn</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (2002) (approving of Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes as relevant evidence of the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 intent).  The Government adds that its interpretation of the Rule furthers these basic purposes.  And, the argument goes, just as defendants must use Rule 11(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s procedures to preserve, for instance,\n \nFourth Amendment unlawful search-and-seizure claims, so must they use it to preserve the constitutional claims at issue here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem with this argument is that, by its own terms, the Rule itself does not say whether it sets forth the <i>exclusive</i> procedure for a defendant to preserve a constitutional claim following a guilty plea.  At the same time, the drafters\xe2\x80\x99 notes acknowledge that the \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme Court has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised after a plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes, at 912.  The notes then specifically refer to the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Menna-Blackledge </i>doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.<i> </i>They add that the Rule \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be interpreted as either broadening or narrowing [that] doctrine or as establishing procedures for its application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>And the notes state that Rule 11(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9chas no application\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9ckinds of constitutional objections\xe2\x80\x9d that may be raised under that doctrine.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The applicability of the <i>Menna-Blackledge </i>doctrine is at issue in this case.  Cf. <i>Broce</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569 (acknowledging <i>Menna </i>and <i>Blackledge </i>as covering claims \xe2\x80\x9cwhere on the face of the record the court had no power to enter the conviction or impose the sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).  We therefore hold that Rule 11(a)(2) cannot resolve this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Third</i>, the Government argues that Class \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly<i> </i>waived\xe2\x80\x9d his right to appeal his constitutional claim.  Brief for United States 15.  The Government concedes that the written plea agreement, which sets forth the \xe2\x80\x9cComplete Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d between Class and the Government, see App. 45\xe2\x80\x9346, does not contain this waiver.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  Rather, the Government relies on the fact that during the Rule 11 plea colloquy, the District Court Judge stated that, under the written plea agreement, Class was \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up [his] right to appeal [his] conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 76.  And Class agreed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not see why the District Court Judge\xe2\x80\x99s statement should bar Class\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims.  It was made to ensure Class understood \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b)(1)(N).  It does not expressly refer to a waiver of the appeal right here at issue.  And if it is interpreted as expressly including that appeal right, it was wrong, as the Government acknowledged at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  Under these circumstances, Class\xe2\x80\x99 acquiescence neither expressly nor implicitly<i> </i>waived his right to appeal his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, we hold that Rodney Class may pursue his constitutional claims on direct appeal.  The contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3854883">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x93424</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">RODNEY CLASS, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[February 21, 2018]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Alito, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Roughly 95% of felony cases in the federal and state courts are resolved by guilty pleas.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Therefore it is critically important that defendants, prosecutors, and judges understand the consequences of these pleas.  In this case, the parties have asked us to identify the claims that a defendant can raise on appeal after entering an unconditional guilty plea.  Regrettably, the Court provides no clear answer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By my count, the Court identifies no fewer than five rules for ascertaining the issues that can be raised.  According to the Court, a defendant who pleads guilty may assert on appeal (1) a claim that \xe2\x80\x9cimplicates \xe2\x80\x98the very power of the State\xe2\x80\x99 to prosecute [him],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 4, (2) a claim that does not contradict the facts alleged in the charging document, <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936, (3) a claim that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the facts alleged and admitted do not constitute a crime,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 5, and (4) claims other than \xe2\x80\x9ccase-related constitutional defects that \xe2\x80\x98occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, the Court suggests (5) that such a defendant may not be able to assert a claim that \xe2\x80\x9ccontradict[s] the terms of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [a] written plea agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 6, but whether this rule applies when the claim falls into one of the prior four categories is left unclear.  How these rules fit together is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  And to make matters worse, the Court also fails to make clear whether its holding is based on the Constitution or some other ground.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">There is no justification for the muddle left by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The question at issue is not conceptually complex.  In determining whether a plea of guilty prevents a defendant in federal or state court from raising a particular issue on appeal, the first question is whether the Federal Constitution precludes waiver.  If the Federal Constitution permits waiver, the next question is whether some other law nevertheless bars waiver.  And if no law prevents waiver, the final question is whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the right to raise the claim on appeal.  <i>McMann</i> v. <i>Richardson</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 759,\n766 (1970)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner Rodney Class was charged with violating a federal statute that forbids the carrying of firearms on the grounds of the United States Capitol.  See\n\n40 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75104(e)(1).  After entering an unconditional guilty plea, he appealed his conviction, asserting that his conduct was protected by the\n \nSecond Amendment and that the statute he violated is unconstitutionally vague.  The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that Class had relinquished his right to litigate these claims when he entered his unconditional plea.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Analyzing this case under the framework set out above, I think the Court of Appeals was clearly correct.  First, the Federal Constitution does not prohibit the waiver of the rights Class asserts.  We have held that most personal constitutional rights may be waived, see, <i>e.g., Peretz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 923\n\xe2\x80\x93937 (1991), and Class concedes that this is so with respect to the rights he is asserting, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, no federal statute or rule bars waiver.  On the contrary, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure makes it clear that, with one exception that I will discuss below, a defendant who enters an unconditional plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims.  Although the Rule does not say this expressly, that is the unmistakable implication of subdivision (a)(2), which allows a defendant, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith the consent of the court and the government,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9center a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere [a law] explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Andrus </i>v.<i> Glover Constr.</i> <i>Co.</i>,\n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 608\n\xe2\x80\x93617 (1980).  And here, there is strong evidence confirming that other exceptions were ruled out.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on Rule 11 make this clear, stating that an unconditional plea (with the previously mentioned exception) \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Notes on 1983 Amendments, 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 911.  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on a federal rule of procedure \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a reliable source of insight into the meaning of a rule, especially when, as here, the rule was enacted precisely as the Advisory Committee proposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Vonn</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (2002).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Subdivision (a)(2) was adopted against the backdrop of decisions of this Court holding that a guilty plea generally relinquishes all defenses to conviction, see, <i>e.g., Tollett </i>v.<i> Henderson</i>,\n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258,\n267 (1973)\n, and Rule 11(a)(2) creates a limited exception to that general principle.  Far from prohibiting the waiver of nonjurisdictional claims, Rule 11 actually bars the raising of such claims (once again, with the previously mentioned exception).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For now, I will skip over that exception and proceed to the final question\xe2\x80\x94whether Class voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to raise his\n \nSecond Amendment and due process claims on appeal.  It is not clear that he raised this question in the Court of Appeals, and in any event, this fact-specific inquiry is not within the scope of the question of law on which we granted review:  \xe2\x80\x9cWhether a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  The Court does not decide the case on that ground.  Nor would I.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I now turn to the one exception mentioned in the Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on Rule 11\xe2\x80\x94what the Notes, rather grandly, term the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Menna-Blackledge</i> doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes, 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., at 912.  This \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine\xe2\x80\x9d consists of <i>Blackledge </i>v. <i>Perry</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21 (1974)\n, a thinly reasoned decision handed down 44 years ago, and <i>Menna </i>v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n423 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61 (1975)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), a <i>per curiam</i> decision issued the next year.  These cases hold that a defendant has the right under the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment to contest certain issues on appeal even if the defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea.  Since a rule of procedure cannot abrogate a constitutional right, the Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on Rule 11 specify that Rule 11(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9chas no application\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Menna-Blackledge </i>doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be interpreted as either broadening or narrowing [that] doctrine or as establishing procedures for its application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes, 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., at 912.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because this doctrine is the only exception recognized in Rule 11 and because the doctrine figures prominently in the opinion of the Court, it is important to examine its foundation and meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Blackledge </i>and <i>Menna </i>represented marked departures from our prior decisions.  Before they were handed down, our precedents were clear: When a defendant pleaded guilty to a crime, he relinquished his right to litigate all nonjurisdictional challenges to his conviction (except for the claim that his plea was not voluntary and intelligent), and the prosecution could assert this forfeiture to defeat a subsequent appeal.  The theory was easy to understand.  As we explained in <i>Tollett</i>,<i> </i>our view was that \xe2\x80\x9ca guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267.  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plead guilty extinguished his right to litigate whatever \xe2\x80\x9cpossible defenses\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional plea[s] in abatement\xe2\x80\x9d he might have pursued at trial or on appeal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 267\xe2\x80\x93268.  Guilty pleas were understood to have this effect because a guilty plea comprises both factual and legal concessions.  Hence, we said in <i>Tollett</i>, a defendant who pleads guilty is barred from contesting not only the \xe2\x80\x9chistorical facts\xe2\x80\x9d but also the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>constitutional significance</i>\xe2\x80\x9d of those facts, even if he failed to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrectly apprais[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that significance at the time of his plea.  <i>Id.,</i> at 267 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When <i>Tollett </i>declared that a guilty plea encompasses all legal and factual concessions necessary to authorize the conviction, it was simply reiterating a principle we had enunciated many times before, most recently in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Brady</i> trilogy.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Brady </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742,\n748 (1970)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he plea is more than an admission of past conduct; it is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent that judgment of conviction may be entered\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>McMann</i>, 397 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 774 (a defendant who pleads guilty \xe2\x80\x9cassumes the risk of ordinary error in either his or his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the law and facts\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Parker </i>v. <i>North Carolina</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 790,\n797 (1970)\n (similar).  As we put it in<i> Boykin</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238,\n242 (1969)\n, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plea of guilty is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but to give judgment and determine punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the strength of that rule, we held that defendants who pleaded guilty forfeited a variety of important constitutional claims.  For instance, a defendant who pleaded guilty could not attack his conviction on the ground that the prosecution violated the Equal Protection Clause by systematically excluding African-Americans from grand juries in the county where he was indicted.  <i>Tollett</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 266.  Nor could he argue that the prosecution unlawfully coerced his confession\xe2\x80\x94even if the confession was the only evidence supporting the conviction.  <i>McMann</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 768; <i>Parker</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 796\xe2\x80\x93797.  Nor could he assert that his statute of conviction employed an unconstitutional penalty provision; his consent to be punished under the statute precluded this defense.  <i>Brady</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 756\xe2\x80\x93757.  Reflecting our general thinking, then-Judge Burger explained: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f voluntarily and understandingly made, even a layman should expect a plea of guilty to be treated as an honest confession of guilt and a waiver of all defenses known and unknown.  And such is the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Edwards </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 256 F.\xc2\xa02d 707, 709 (CADC 1958) (footnote omitted); see also A. Bishop, Waivers in Pleas of Guilty, 60 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 513, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (1974) (summarizing the state of the law on the eve of <i>Blackledge</i>: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the bulwarks of the fortress of defense are abandoned by the plea of guilty.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The meaning of this distinction, however, is hard to grasp.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The most natural way to understand <i>Blackledge</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe very power of the State\xe2\x80\x9d would be to say that an argument survives a guilty plea if it attacks the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  After all, that is usually what we mean when we refer to the power to adjudicate.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500,\n514 (2006)\n; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cotton</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 625,\n630 (2002)\n;<i> Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n89 (1998)\n.  But that cannot be what <i>Blackledge</i> meant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the defendant in <i>Blackledge </i>had been tried in state court in North Carolina for a state-law offense, and the jurisdiction of state courts to entertain such prosecutions is purely a matter of state law (unless Congress validly and affirmatively ousts their jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94something that had not happened in that case).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Second, a rule that jurisdictional defects alone survive a guilty plea would not explain the result in <i>Blackledge</i> itself.  Arguments attacking a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction can neither be waived nor forfeited.  See, <i>e.g., Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections</i> v. <i>Schacht</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 381,\n389 (1998)\n; <i>Miller </i>v.<i> Roberts</i>, 212 N.\xc2\xa0C. 126, 129, 193 S.\xc2\xa0E. 286, 288 (1937).  But the due process right at issue in <i>Blackledge </i>was perfectly capable of being waived or forfeited\xe2\x80\x94as is just about every other right that is personal to a criminal defendant.  See, <i>e.g., Peretz</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 936\xe2\x80\x93937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So if the \xe2\x80\x9cvery power to prosecute\xe2\x80\x9d theory does not refer to jurisdiction, what else might it mean?  The only other possibility that comes to mind is that it might mean that a defendant can litigate a claim if it asserts a right not to be tried, as opposed to a right not to be convicted.  But we have said that \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually all rights of criminal defendants\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cmerely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. right[s] not to be convicted,\xe2\x80\x9d as distinguished from \xe2\x80\x9cright[s] not to be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Flanagan </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259,\n267 (1984)\n.  Even when a constitutional violation requires the dismissal of an indictment, that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mean that [the] defendant enjoy[ed] a \xe2\x80\x98right not to be tried\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the charges.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mac- Donald</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 850\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (1978).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rule could hardly be otherwise.  Most constitutional defenses (and plenty of statutory defenses), if successfully asserted in a pretrial motion, deprive the prosecution of the \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d to proceed to trial or secure a conviction.  If that remedial consequence converted them all into rights not to be prosecuted, <i>Blackledge</i> would have no discernible limit.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have, after all, acknowledged that virtually every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a \xe2\x80\x98right not to stand trial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Digital Equipment Corp.</i> v. <i>Desktop Direct, Inc.</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 863,\n873 (1994)\n.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9call litigants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Van Cauwenberghe</i> v. <i>Biard</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 517,\n524 (1988)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that we have spoken of a distinction between a right not to be tried and a right not to be convicted in one context: when defining the scope of the collateral order doctrine.  <i>E.g., Flanagan</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 265\xe2\x80\x93267.  That is, we have allowed defendants in federal criminal cases to take an immediate appeal from the denial of a pretrial motion when the right at issue is properly understood to be a right not to be tried.  A prime example is a case in which a defendant claims that a prosecution would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See <i>Abney </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651,\n662 (1977)\n.  Allowing an interlocutory appeal in that situation protects against all the harms that flow from the prolongation of a case that should never have been brought.  See <i>id.,</i> at 661.  But that rationale cannot justify the <i>Menna-Blackledge </i>doctrine, because allowing a defendant to appeal after a guilty plea does not cut short a prosecution that should never have been brought.  On the contrary, it prolongs the litigation.  So the distinction drawn in our collateral order cases makes no sense in distinguishing between the claims that should and the claims that should not survive a guilty plea.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor, in any event, would such a rule be consistent with the <i>decision</i> in <i>Blackledge</i>, because we have held that an unsuccessful vindictive prosecution claim may <i>not</i> be appealed before trial.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hollywood Motor Car Co.</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 263,\n264 (1982)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  And none of this would do any good for Class, for we have never permitted a defendant to appeal a pretrial order rejecting a constitutional challenge to the statute the defendant allegedly violated.  In fact we have repudiated the very suggestion.  <i>Id.,</i> at 270.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cright not to be prosecuted\xe2\x80\x9d has no intelligible meaning in this context.  And <i>Blackledge</i> identified no basis for this new right in the text of the Constitution or history or prior precedent.  What is more, it did all this without bothering to consider the understanding of a guilty plea under the law of the State where the <i>Blackledge</i> defendant was convicted or anything that was said to him or that he said at the time of his plea.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If the thinking behind <i>Blackledge</i> is hard to follow, <i>Menna</i> may be worse.  In that case, the Court held that a defendant who pleaded guilty could challenge his conviction on double jeopardy grounds.  423 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62.  The case was decided by a three-page <i>per curiam</i> opinion, its entire analysis confined to a single footnote.  And the footnote, rather than elucidating what was said in <i>Blackledge</i>, substituted a different rationale.  Arguing that <i>Tollett</i> and the other prior related cases did not preclude appellate review of the double jeopardy claim, the Court wrote:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it <i>quite validly</i> removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.  In most cases, factual guilt is a sufficient basis for the State\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of punishment.  A guilty plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Menna</i>, 423 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The wording of the final sentence is not easy to parse, but I interpret the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning as follows: A defendant who pleads guilty does no more than admit that he committed the essential conduct charged in the indictment; therefore a guilty plea allows the litigation on appeal of any claim that is not inconsistent with the facts that the defendant necessarily admitted.  If that is the correct meaning, the sentence would overrule many of the cases that it purported to distinguish, including <i>Tollett</i>, which involved an unconstitutional grand jury claim.  It would contradict much that the Court had previously said about the effect of a guilty plea.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Boykin</i>, 395 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242 (\xe2\x80\x9cA plea of guilty is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it would permit a defendant who pleads guilty to raise on appeal a whole host of claims, including, for example, the denial of motions to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or\n \nSixth Amendments.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Linkletter</i> v. <i>Walker</i>,\n\n381 U.\xc2\xa0S. 618,\n638 (1965)\n (most\n \nFourth Amendment claims have \xe2\x80\x9cno bearing on guilt\xe2\x80\x9d).  A holding of that scope is not what one expects to see in a footnote in a <i>per curiam</i> opinion, but if the Court meant less, its meaning is unclear.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When the Court returned to <i>Blackledge</i> and <i>Menna</i> in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Broce</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563 (1989)\n, the Court essentially repudiated the theories offered in those earlier cases.  (The Court terms this a \xe2\x80\x9creaffirm[ation].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6.)  Like <i>Menna</i>, <i>Broce</i> involved a defendant (actually two defendants) who pleaded guilty but then sought to attack their convictions on double jeopardy grounds.  488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 565.  This time, however, the Court held that their guilty pleas prevented them from litigating their claims.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court began by specifically disavowing <i>Menna</i>\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that a guilty plea admits only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98factual guilt,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cthe acts described in the indictments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Broce</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568\xe2\x80\x93569.  Instead, the Court explained, an unconditional guilty plea admits \xe2\x80\x9call of the factual <i>and legal elements</i> necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 569 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy entering a plea of guilty, the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment; he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 570.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cadmissions,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Broce</i> continued, are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  And invoking <i>Tollett</i>,<i> </i>the Court added that it makes no difference whether the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may not have correctly appraised the constitutional significance of certain historical facts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572 (quoting 411 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267).  Thus, the Court concluded, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plead guilty necessarily extinguishes whatever \xe2\x80\x9cpotential defense[s]\xe2\x80\x9d he might have asserted in an effort to show that it would be unlawful to hold him liable for his conduct.  488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573.  So much for <i>Menna</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As for <i>Blackledge</i>, by holding that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 double jeopardy rights were extinguished by their pleas, <i>Broce </i>necessarily rejected the idea that a right not to be tried survives an unconditional guilty plea.  See <i>Abney</i>, 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 662 (holding for collateral-order-doctrine purposes that the Double Jeopardy Clause confers a right not to be tried).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While <i>Broce</i> thus rejected the reasoning in <i>Blackledg</i>e and <i>Menna</i>, the Court was content to distinguish those cases on the ground that they involved defendants who could succeed on appeal without going beyond \xe2\x80\x9cthe existing record,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the defendants in <i>Broce</i> would have to present new evidence.  <i>Broce</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 575.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This is where the <i>Menna-Blackledge</i> doctrine stood when we heard this case.  Now, instead of clarifying the law, the Court sows new confusion by reiterating with seeming approval a string of catchphrases.  The Court repeats the line that an argument survives if it \xe2\x80\x9cimplicates \xe2\x80\x98the very power of the State\xe2\x80\x99 to prosecute the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 4 (quoting <i>Blackledge</i>, 417 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 30), but this shibboleth is no more intelligible now than it was when first incanted in <i>Blackledge</i>.  The Court also parrots the rule set out in the <i>Menna</i> footnote\xe2\x80\x94that the only arguments waived by a guilty plea are those that contradict the facts alleged in the charging document, see <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936, even though that rule is inconsistent with <i>Tollett</i>, the <i>Brady</i> trilogy, and <i>Broce</i>\xe2\x80\x94and even though this reading would permit a defendant who pleads guilty to raise an uncertain assortment of claims never before thought to survive a guilty plea.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For example, would this rule permit a defendant to argue that his prosecution is barred by a statute of limitations or by the Speedy Trial Act?  Presumably the answer is yes.  By admitting commission of the acts alleged in an indictment or complaint, a defendant would not concede that the charge was timely.  What about the argument that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged conduct does not violate the statute of conviction?  Here again, the rule barring only those claims inconsistent with the facts alleged in the indictment or complaint would appear to permit the issue to be raised on appeal, but the Court says that a defendant who pleads guilty \xe2\x80\x9chas admitted the charges against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  What does this mean, exactly?  The majority is coy, but \xe2\x80\x9cadmit[ing] the charges against him\xe2\x80\x9d would appear to mean admitting that his conduct satisfies each element of the statute he is charged with violating.  It must mean that because we have held that if a defendant does <i>not</i> understand that he is admitting his conduct satisfies each element of the crime, his guilty plea is involuntary and unintelligent and therefore invalid.  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>,\n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 637\n\xe2\x80\x93645 (1976).  So if a defendant who pleads guilty \xe2\x80\x9cadmit[s] the charges against him,\xe2\x80\x9d and if he does not claim that his plea was involuntary or unintelligent, his plea must be taken as an admission that he did everything the statute forbids.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But if that is so, then what about the rule suggested by the old Massachusetts opinion the Court touts?  There, Justice Ames wrote that a guilty plea does not waive the right to argue that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the facts alleged and admitted do not constitute a crime against the laws of the Commonwealth.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 5 (quoting <i>Commonwealth </i>v.<i> Hinds</i>, 101 Mass. 209, 210 (1869)).  Does the Court agree with Justice Ames, or not?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Approaching the question from the opposite direction, the Court says that a guilty plea precludes a defendant from litigating \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutionality of case-related government conduct that takes place before the plea is entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  This category is most mysterious.  I thought Class was arguing that the Government violated the Constitution at the moment when it initiated his prosecution.  That sounds like he is trying to attack \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutionality of case-related government conduct that [took] place before the plea [was] entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet the Court holds that he may proceed.  Why?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority instructs that \xe2\x80\x9ca valid guilty plea relinquishes any claim that would contradict the \xe2\x80\x98admissions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Broce</i>, 488 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574).  I agree with that statement of the rule, but what the Court fails to acknowledge is that the scope of this rule depends on the law of the particular jurisdiction in question.  If a defendant in federal court is told that under Rule 11 an unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims (or as <i>Broce</i> put it, admits \xe2\x80\x9call of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 569), then that is the scope of the admissions implicit in the plea.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Perhaps sensing the incoherence of its effort, the majority seeks refuge in history, asserting that today\xe2\x80\x99s holding \xe2\x80\x9cflows directly from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 3.  But this history cannot prop up the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Start with <i>Haynes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 85\n, n.\xc2\xa02 (1968), in which the Court reached the merits of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional challenge to his conviction despite the fact that he had pleaded guilty.  <i>Ante,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  A moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance reveals that this decision is irrelevant for present purposes (which presumably explains why it was not even cited in <i>Blackledge</i>, <i>Menna</i>,<i> Tollett</i>, the<i> Brady </i>trilogy, or <i>Broce</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Haynes</i>, the Government did not argue that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea barred him from pressing his constitutional challenge on appeal.  In fact, the Government conceded that he would be entitled to relief if his argument had merit.  390 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 100\xe2\x80\x93101.  No one has suggested that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea strips an appellate court of jurisdiction to entertain a constitutional challenge to his conviction, so of course a reviewing court need not dismiss an appeal <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> if the Government does not assert the plea as a bar.  But that tells us nothing about what ought to happen when, as in this case, the Government <i>does</i> argue that the defendant relinquished his right to litigate his constitutional argument when he opted to plead guilty.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One must squint even harder to figure out why the majority has dusted off <i>Commonwealth </i>v. <i>Hinds</i>, an 1869 decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.  <i>Ante, </i>at 5.  <i>Hinds</i> involved a state-law motion (\xe2\x80\x9carrest of judgment\xe2\x80\x9d) to set aside a conviction for a state-law crime (common law forgery), in a state-court proceeding after the defendant pleaded guilty.  101 Mass., at 210.  One might already be wondering what relevance the effect of a guilty plea in state court, under state law, could have with respect to the effect of a guilty plea in federal court, under federal law.  But in any event, what <i>Hinds</i> says about guilty pleas is not helpful to Class at all.  In Massachusetts at that time, motions to arrest a judgment could be maintained only on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked jurisdiction.  Mass. Gen. Stat. \xc2\xa779 (1860); <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Eagan</i>, 103 Mass. 71, 72 (1860); 3 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \xc2\xa73202, p.\xc2\xa0177 (7th rev. ed. 1874).  And Massachusetts, like all the other States, can define the jurisdiction of its courts as it pleases (except insofar as federal law validly prevents).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, to the extent <i>Hinds</i> \xe2\x80\x9creflect[s] an understanding of the nature of guilty pleas,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 5, it reflects nothing more than the idea that a defendant can assert jurisdictional defects even after pleading guilty.  That rule is utterly unremarkable and of no help to Class.  Today\xe2\x80\x94as well as at the time of the founding\xe2\x80\x94federal courts have jurisdiction over cases charging federal crimes.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73231; \xc2\xa79,\n\n1Stat.\n76\xe2\x80\x9377.  And as early as 1830, the Court rejected the suggestion that a federal court is deprived of jurisdiction if \xe2\x80\x9cthe indictment charges an offence not punishable criminally according to the law of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Watkins</i>, 3 Pet. 193, 203.  We have repeatedly reaffirmed that proposition.  See, <i>e.g., Lamar</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n240 U.\xc2\xa0S. 60,\n64 (1916)\n (court not deprived of jurisdiction even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe indictment does not charge a crime against the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 58\n\xe2\x80\x9369 (1951) (same, even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute is wholly unconstitutional, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the facts stated in the indictment do not constitute a crime\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Cotton</i>, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 630\xe2\x80\x93631.  And although a handful of our \xe2\x80\x9cpost\xe2\x80\x931867 cases\xe2\x80\x9d suggested that a criminal court lacked jurisdiction if \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute under which [the defendant] had been convicted was unconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d those suggestions \xe2\x80\x9creflected a \xe2\x80\x98softening\xe2\x80\x99 of the concept of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d rather than that concept\xe2\x80\x99s originally understood\xe2\x80\x94and modern\xe2\x80\x94meaning.  <i>Danforth</i> v. <i>Minnesota</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 264\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (2008).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, the governing law in the present case is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Under that Rule, an unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims with the possible exception of the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Menna-Blackledge</i> doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d created years ago by this Court.  That doctrine is vacuous, has no sound foundation, and produces nothing but confusion.  At a minimum, I would limit the doctrine to the particular types of claims involved in those cases.  I certainly would not expand its reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I fear that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will bedevil the lower courts.

It is difficult to see how that can be true.  Class\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nSecond Amendment argument is that banning firearms in the Maryland Avenue parking lot of the Capitol Building goes too far, at least as applied to him specifically.  As his court-appointed <i>amicus</i> presented it to the Court of Appeals, this argument depends on Class\xe2\x80\x99s own personal characteristics, including his record of mental health and law abidingness, as well as characteristics specific to the Maryland Avenue parking lot, including, <i>inter alia</i>, its distance from the Capitol Building, the extent to which it is unsecured, the extent to which it is publicly accessible, what business typically occurs there, who regularly congregates there, and the nature of security screening visitors must pass through upon entering.  See Opening Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Appellant in No. 15\xe2\x80\x933015 (CADC), pp. 34\xe2\x80\x9335, 41\xe2\x80\x9345.  Similarly, Class\xe2\x80\x99s due process argument requires an assessment of how difficult it would be for an average person to determine that the Maryland Avenue lot is part of the Capitol Grounds, which turns on the extent to which the lot is publicly acces-sible, how heavily trafficked it is and by what types of vehicles, whether there are signs indicating it is part of the Capitol Grounds or that guns are prohibited and where such signs are located, and whether there are security gates or checkpoints nearby.  See <i>id.,</i> at 51, 53.  These arguments require facts.  I understand the majority opinion to preclude Class from gathering any of them that are not already in the District Court record.</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
