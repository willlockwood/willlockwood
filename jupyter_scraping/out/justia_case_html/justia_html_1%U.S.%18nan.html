Plaintiff\'s Council insisted to know, whether the Defendant had gone through all his evidence; and said that he was not entitled to the opinion of the Court till then upon his title in a third person. BUT THE COURT determined contra: and then gave their opinion, that as the Defendant\'s deed was a conditional deed upon the face of it, he was not intitled to a nonsuit. The Plaintiff\'s Council then contended, that they had a right to demur to the Defendant\'s evidence. This was opposed by the Defendant\'s Council, who insisted they had a right to go through their evidence, before the Demurrer was allowed. Of which opinion THE COURT also was: and the Defendant proceeded with his evidence, among which was a letter from William Penn, the first, acknowledging this sale and grant.
