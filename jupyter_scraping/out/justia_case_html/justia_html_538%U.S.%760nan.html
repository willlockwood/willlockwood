Martinez was no more compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself than an immunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt. That an immunized witness knows that his statements may not be used against him, while Martinez likely did not, does not make the immunized witness\' statements any less compelled and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit\'s conclusion that coercive police interrogations alone violate the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, those subjected to coercive interrogations have an automatic protection from the use of their involuntary statements in any subsequent criminal trial, <i>e. g., Oregon </i>v. <i>Elstad, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html">470 U.

Pefia then drew her gun and shot Martinez several times, causing severe injuries that left Martinez permanently blinded and paralyzed from the waist down. The officers then placed Martinez under arrest.</p><p>Petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor, arrived on the scene minutes later with paramedics. Chavez accompanied Martinez to the hospital and then questioned Martinez there while he was receiving treatment from medical personnel. The interview lasted a total of about 10 minutes, over a 45minute period, with Chavez leaving the emergency room for periods of time to permit medical personnel to attend to Martinez.</p><p>At first, most of Martinez\'s answers consisted of "I don\'t know," "I am dying," and "I am choking."

The District Court granted summary judgment to Martinez as to Chavez\'s qualified immunity defense on both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. Chavez took an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court\'s denial of qualified immunity. <i>Martinez </i>v. <i>Oxnard, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/270/852/">270 F.3d 852</a> (2001). Applying <i>Saucier </i>v. <i>Katz, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/case.html">533 U. S. 194</a> (2001), the Ninth Circuit first concluded that Chavez\'s actions, as alleged by Martinez, deprived Martinez of his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Ninth Circuit did not attempt to explain how Martinez had been "compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." Instead, the Ninth Circuit reiterated the holding of an earlier Ninth Circuit case, <i>Cooper </i>v. <i>Dupnik, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/963/1220/">963 F.2d 1220</a>, 1229 (1992) (en banc), that "the Fifth Amendment\'s purpose is to prevent coercive interrogation practices that are destructive of human dignity," 270 F. 3d, at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted), and found that Chavez\'s "coercive questioning" of Martinez violated his Fifth Amendment rights, "[e]ven though Martinez\'s statements were not used against him in a criminal proceeding," <i>ibid. </i>As to Martinez\'s due process claim, the Ninth Circuit held that "a police officer violates the Fourteenth Amendment when he obtains a confession by coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at trial." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights asserted by Martinez were clearly established by federal law, explaining that a reasonable officer "would have known that persistent interrogation of the suspect despite repeated requests to stop violated the sus-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="766">766</a></p><p>Opinion of THOMAS, J.</p><p>pect\'s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from coercive interrogation." <i>Id., </i>at 858.</p><p>We granted certiorari. 535 U. S. 1111 (2002).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>In deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, we must first determine whether the officer\'s alleged conduct violated a constitutional right. See <i>Katz, </i>533 U. S., at 201. If not, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity, and we need not consider whether the asserted right was "clearly established." <i>Ibid. </i>We conclude that Martinez\'s allegations fail to state a violation of his constitutional rights.</p><p align="center">\nA 1</p><p>The Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Malloy </i>v. <i>Hogan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html">378 U. S. 1</a> (1964), requires that "[n]o person ... shall be compelled <i>in </i>any criminal case to be a <i>witness </i>against himself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (emphases added). We fail to see how, based on the text of the Fifth Amendment, Martinez can allege a violation of this right, since Martinez was never prosecuted for a crime, let alone compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.</p><p>Although Martinez contends that the meaning of "criminal case" should encompass the entire criminal investigatory process, including police interrogations, Brief for Respondent 23, we disagree. In our view, a "criminal case" at the very least requires the initiation of legal proceedings. See <i>Blyew </i>v. <i>United States, </i>13 Wall. 581, 595 (1872) ("The words \'case\' and \'cause\' are constantly used as synonyms in statutes and judicial decisions, each meaning <i>a proceeding in court, a suit, or action" </i>(emphasis added)); Black\'s Law Dictionary 215 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "[c]ase" as "[a] general term for an action, cause, suit, or controversy at law ... ; a question <i>contested before a court of justice" </i>(emphasis added)). We</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="767">767</a></p><p>need not decide today the precise moment when a "criminal case" commences; it is enough to say that police questioning does not constitute a "case" any more than a private investigator\'s precomplaint activities constitute a "civil case." Statements compelled by police interrogations of course may not be used against a defendant at trial, see <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Mississippi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html">297 U. S. 278</a>, 286 (1936), but it is not until their use in a criminal case that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause occurs, see <i>United States </i>v. <i>VerdugoUrquidez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/259/case.html">494 U. S. 259</a>, 264 (1990) ("The privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment is <i>a fundamental trial right </i>of criminal defendants. Although conduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately impair that right, <i>a constitutional violation occurs only at trial" </i>(emphases added; citations omitted)); <i>Withrow </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/case.html">507 U.

The text of the Self-Incrimination Clause simply cannot support the Ninth Circuit\'s view that the mere use of compulsive questioning, without more, violates the Constitution.</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>Nor can the Ninth Circuit\'s approach be reconciled with our case law.

See <i>Minnesota </i>v. <i>Murphy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/420/case.html">465 U.

Even for persons who have a legitimate fear that their statements may subject them to criminal prosecution, we have long permitted the compulsion of incriminating testimony so long as those statements (or evidence derived from those statements) cannot be used against the speaker in any criminal case. See <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Walker, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/591/case.html">161 U.

We have also recognized that governments may penalize public employees and government contractors (with the loss of their jobs or government contracts) to induce them to respond to inquiries, so long as the answers elicited (and their fruits) are immunized from use in any criminal case against the speaker.

One difference, perhaps, is that the immunized witness <i>knows </i>that his statements will not, and may not, be used against him, whereas Martinez likely did not. But this does not make the statements of the immunized witness any less "compelled" and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit\'s conclusion that coercive police interrogations, absent the use of the involuntary statements in a criminal case, violate the Fifth Amendment\'s Self-Incrimination Clause. Moreover, our cases provide that those subjected to coercive police interrogations have an <i>automatic </i>protection from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent criminal trial. <i>Oregon </i>v. <i>Elstad, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html">470 U.

"); <i>Lefkowitz </i>v. <i>Turley, supra, </i>at 77 (stating that the Fifth Amendment privilege allows one "not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings"), that does not alter our conclusion that a violation of the constitutional <i>right </i>against self-incrimination occurs only if one has been compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.</p><p>In the Fifth Amendment context, we have created prophylactic rules designed to safeguard the core constitutional right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Tucker, </i>417 U.

Among these rules is an evidentiary privilege that protects witnesses from being forced to give incriminating testimony, even in noncriminal cases, unless that testimony has been immunized</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="771">771</a></p><p>from use and derivative use in a future criminal proceeding before it is compelled.

See <i>Tucker, supra, </i>at 440-441 ("Testimony obtained in civil suits, or before administrative or legislative committees, could [absent a grant of immunity] prove so incriminating that a person compelled to give such testimony might readily be convicted on the basis of those disclosures in a subsequent criminal proceeding"). Because the failure to assert the privilege will often forfeit the right to exclude the evidence in a subsequent "criminal case," see <i>Murphy, </i>465 U.

As we explained, we have allowed the Fifth Amendment privilege to be asserted by witnesses in noncriminal cases in order to safeguard the core constitutional right defined by the Self-Incrimination Clause-the right not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against oneself. 3 We have likewise established the <i>Miranda </i>exclusionary rule as a prophylactic measure to prevent violations of the right protected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause-the admission into evidence in a criminal case of confessions obtained through coercive custodial questioning. See <i>Warren </i>v. <i>Lincoln, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/864/1436/">864 F.2d 1436</a>, 1442 <i>(CA8 </i>1989) (alleged <i>Miranda </i>violation not actionable under \xc2\xa7 1983); <i>Giuffre </i>v. <i>Bissell, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/31/1241/">31 F.3d 1241</a>, 1256 <i>(CA3 </i>1994) (same); <i>Bennett </i>v. <i>Passic, 545 </i>F. 2d 1260, 1263 (CAlO 1976) (same); see also <i>New York </i>v. <i>Quarles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/649/case.html">467 U.

Although <i>Rochin </i>did not establish a civil remedy for abusive police behavior, we recognized in <i>County of Sacramento </i>v. <i>Lewis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/case.html">523 U.

While we rejected, in <i>Lewis, </i>a \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff\'s contention that a police officer\'s deliberate indifference during a high-speed chase that caused the death of a motorcyclist violated due process, <i>id., </i>at 854, we left open the possibility that unauthorized police behavior in other contexts might "shock the conscience" and give rise to \xc2\xa7 1983 liability. <i>Id., </i>at 850.</p><p>We are satisfied that Chavez\'s questioning did not violate Martinez\'s due process rights.

S., at 394-395. If, as JUSTICE KENNEDY believes, the Fifth Amendment\'s Self-Incrimination Clause governs coercive police interrogation even absent use of compelled statements in a criminal case, then <i>Graham </i>suggests that the Due Process Clause would not.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="775">775</a></p><p>nez\'s characterization of Chavez\'s behavior as "egregious" or "conscience shocking." As we noted in <i>Lewis, </i>the official conduct "most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level" is the "conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest." <i>Id., </i>at 849. Here, there is no evidence that Chavez acted with a purpose to harm Martinez by intentionally interfering with his medical treatment. Medical personnel were able to treat Martinez throughout the interview, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, 18a, and Chavez ceased his questioning to allow tests and other procedures to be performed. <i>Id., </i>at 4a. Nor is there evidence that Chavez\'s conduct exacerbated Martinez\'s injuries or prolonged his stay in the hospital. Moreover, the need to investigate whether there had been police misconduct constituted a justifiable government interest given the risk that key evidence would have been lost if Martinez had died without the authorities ever hearing his side of the story.</p><p>The Court has held that the Due Process Clause also protects certain "fundamental liberty interest[s]" from deprivation by the government, regardless of the procedures provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Glucksberg, 521 </i>U.

We therefore must take into account the fact that Martinez was hospitalized and in severe pain during the interview, but also that Martinez was a critical nonpolice witness to an altercation resulting in a shooting by a police officer, and that the situation was urgent given the perceived risk that Martinez might die and crucial evidence might be lost. In these circumstances, we can find no basis in our prior jurisprudence, see, <i>e. g., Miranda, </i>384 U. S., at 477-478 ("It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement"), or in our Nation\'s history and traditions to suppose that freedom from unwanted police questioning is a right so fundamental that it cannot be abridged absent a "compelling state interest." <i>Flores, supra, </i>at 302. We have never required such a justification for a police interrogation, and we decline to do so here. The lack of any "guideposts for responsible decisionmaking" in this area, and our oft-stated reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process, further counsel against recognizing a new "fundamental liberty interest" in this case.</p><p>We conclude that Martinez has failed to allege a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is therefore unnecessary to inquire whether the right asserted by Martinez was clearly established.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Because Chavez did not violate Martinez\'s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, he was entitled to qualified immunity.

I write separately because I believe that our decision requires a degree of discretionary judgment greater than JUSTICE THOMAS acknowledges. As he points out, the text of the Fifth Amendment (applied here under the doctrine of Fourteenth Amendment incorporation) focuses on courtroom use of a criminal defendant\'s compelled, selfincriminating testimony, and the core of the guarantee against compelled self-incrimination is the exclusion of any such evidence. JUSTICE GINSBURG makes it clear that the present case is very close to <i>Mincey </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/385/case.html">437 U. S. 385</a> (1978), and Martinez\'s testimony would clearly be inadmissible if offered in evidence against him. But Martinez claims more than evidentiary protection in asking this Court to hold that the questioning alone was a completed violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments subject to redress by an action for damages under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p><p>To recognize such a constitutional cause of action for compensation would, of course, be well outside the core of Fifth Amendment protection, but that alone is not a sufficient reason to reject Martinez\'s claim.

See <i>id., </i>at 515, 517 (Harlan, J., dissenting). The most obvious drawback inherent in Martinez\'s purely Fifth Amendment claim to damages is its risk of global application in every instance of interrogation producing a statement inadmissible under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment principles, or violating one of the complementary rules we have accepted in aid of the privilege against evidentiary use. If obtaining Martinez\'s statement is to be treated as a stand-alone violation of the privilege subject to compensation, why should the same not be true whenever the police obtain any involuntary selfincriminating statement, or whenever the government so much as threatens a penalty in derogation of the right to</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="779">779</a></p><p>immunity, or whenever the police fail to honor <i>Miranda?* </i>Martinez offers no limiting principle or reason to foresee a stopping place short of liability in all such cases.</p><p>Recognizing an action for damages in every such instance not only would revolutionize Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment law, but would beg the question that must inform every extension or recognition of a complementary rule in service of the core privilege: why is this new rule necessary in aid of the basic guarantee? Martinez has offered no reason to believe that the guarantee has been ineffective in all or many of those circumstances in which its vindication has depended on excluding testimonial admissions or barring penalties. And I have no reason to believe the law has been systemically defective in this respect.</p><p>But if there is no failure of efficacy infecting the existing body of Fifth Amendment law, any argument for a damages remedy in this case must depend not on its Fifth Amendment feature but upon the particular charge of outrageous conduct by the police, extending from their initial encounter with Martinez through the questioning by Chavez. That claim, however, if it is to be recognized as a constitutional one that may be raised in an action under \xc2\xa7 1983, must sound in substantive due process.

And without a violation of the right protected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause (what the plurality and JUSTICE SOUTER call the Fifth Amendment\'s "core"), Martinez\'s 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983 action is doomed. Section 1983 does not provide remedies for violations of judicially created prophylactic rules, such as the rule of <i>Miranda </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U.

S. 1</a> (1964).</p><p>2 Still less does \xc2\xa7 1983 provide a remedy for actions inconsistent with the perceived "purpose" of a constitutional provision. Cf. <i>Martinez </i>v. <i>Oxnard, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/270/852/">270 F.3d 852</a>, 857 <i>(CA9 </i>2001) ("[T]he Fifth Amendment\'s purpose is to prevent coercive interrogation practices that are destructive of human dignity" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="781">781</a></p><p>My reasons for rejecting Martinez\'s Fifth Amendment claim are those set forth in JUSTICE THOMAS\'S opinion. I join Parts I and II of that opinion, including Part II-B, which deals with substantive due process. Consideration and rejection of that constitutional claim is absolutely necessary to support reversal of the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment. For after discussing (and erroneously deciding) Martinez\'s Fifth Amendment claim, the Ninth Circuit continued as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Likewise, a police officer violates the Fourteenth Amendment when he obtains a confession by coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at trial. \'The due process violation caused by coercive behavior of law-enforcement officers in pursuit of a confession is <i>complete with the coercive behavior itself ... The actual use or attempted use of that coerced statement in a court of law is not necessary to complete the affront to the Constitution.\' Cooper v. Dupnik, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/963/1244/">963 F.2d 1244</a>-45 (emphasis added). Mr. Martinez has thus stated a <i>prima facie </i>case that Sergeant Chavez violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from police coercion in pursuit of a confession." <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/270/852/">270 F.3d 852</a>, 857 (2001).</p></blockquote><p>It seems to me impossible to interpret this passage as anything other than an invocation of the doctrine of "substantive due process," which makes unlawful certain government conduct, regardless of whether the procedural guarantees of the Fifth Amendment (or the guarantees of any of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights) have been violated. See <i>Washington </i>v. <i>Glucksberg, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/case.html">521 U. S. 702</a> (1997). To be sure, the term "substantive due process" is not used in the quoted passage, but the passage\'s technically false dichotomy between Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights uses "Fourteenth Amendment rights" as a stand-in for <i>that aspect </i>of the Fourteenth Amendment which consists of the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="782">782</a></p><p>SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment</p><p>doctrine of substantive due process. (JUSTICE THOMAS uses similar shorthand in the concluding sentence of his analysis:</p><p>"Our views on the proper scope of the Fifth Amendment\'s Self- Incrimination Clause do not mean that police torture or other abuse that results in a confession is constitutionally permissible so long as the statements are not used at trial; it simply means that the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Due Process Clause, rather than the Fifth Amendment\'s SelfIncrimination Clause, would govern the inquiry in those cases." <i>Ante, </i>at 773.) What other <i>possible meaning </i>could the passage possess? Surely the Ninth Circuit was not expending a paragraph to make the utterly useless observation that, in addition to violating the Fifth Amendment (because that is incorporated in the Fourteenth) Chavez violated the Fourteenth Amendment (because that incorporates the Fifth). That <i>substantive due process </i>was the point is confirmed by the fact that the sole authority cited to support violation of "the Fourteenth Amendment" is <i>Cooper </i>v. <i>Dup</i><i>nik, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/963/1220/">963 F.2d 1220</a>, 1244-1245 (1992), a Ninth Circuit case that explicitly recognized a substantive-due-process right to be free from coercive police questioning. See <i>id., </i>at 1244-1250.</p><p>Since the Ninth Circuit\'s Fourteenth Amendment holding rested upon substantive due process, we are without authority to disturb that court\'s judgment solely because of our disagreement with its Fifth Amendment (Self-Incrimination Clause) analysis; the substantive-due-process holding provides an independent ground supporting the decision that Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity. While JusTICE SOUTER declines to address that independent groundeven though the parties extensively briefed the issue, Brief for Petitioner 21-36; Brief for Respondent 29-40; Reply Brief for Petitioner 8-12; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>17-23, and even though JUSTICE STEVENS discusses it in dissent, <i>post, </i>at 787-788 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)-I believe that addressing it, and resolving</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="783">783</a></p><p>it against respondent, is essential to the Court\'s disposition, which reverses the Ninth Circuit\'s judgment in its entirety.</p><p>I therefore see no basis for a remand to determine "[w]hether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a substantive due process violation." <i>Ante, </i>at 779 (majority opinion). That question has already been decided by the Ninth Circuit, and we today reverse its decision. My disagreement with the Court, however, is of little consequence, because Martinez will not be able to prevail on remand by raising anew his substantive-due-process claim. Not only is the claim meritless, as JUSTICE THOMAS demonstrates, <i>ante, </i>at 774-776, but Martinez already had his chance to press a substantive-due-process theory in the Court of Appeals and chose not to, even though Ninth Circuit precedent clearly established substantive due process (including-contrary to the Government\'s assertion at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-a "shocks the conscience" criterion) as an available theory of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment. See <i>Cooper, supra, </i>at 1248 ("There is a second Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process yardstick available to Cooper as a theory of \xc2\xa7 1983 liability. The test is whether the Task Force\'s conduct \'shocks the conscience\' "). Nowhere did respondent\'s appellate brief mention the words "substantive due process"; the only rights it asserted were the right against self-incrimination and the right to warnings under <i>Miranda </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U.

The exclusion of unwarned statements, when not within an exception, is a complete and sufficient remedy.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS are wrong, in my view, to maintain that in all instances a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause simply does not occur unless and until a statement is introduced at trial, no matter how severe the pain or how direct and commanding the official compulsion used to extract it.</p><p>It must be remembered that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States in its full text through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Malloy </i>v. <i>Hogan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html">378 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (1964); <i>Griffin </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/609/case.html">380 U. S. 609</a>, 615 (1965). The question is the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="791">791</a></p><p>proper interpretation of the Self-Incrimination Clause in the context of the present dispute.</p><p>Our cases and our legal tradition establish that the SelfIncrimination Clause is a substantive constraint on the conduct of the government, not merely an evidentiary rule governing the work of the courts. The Clause must provide more than mere assurance that a compelled statement will not be introduced against its declarant in a criminal trial. Otherwise there will be too little protection against the compulsion the Clause prohibits. The Clause protects an individual from being forced to give answers demanded by an official in any context when the answers might give rise to criminal liability in the future. "It can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory; and it protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used." <i>Kastigar </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/case.html">406 U. S. 441</a>, 444-445 (1972) (footnotes omitted). The decision in <i>Kastigar </i>described the Self-Incrimination Clause as an exemption from the testimonial duty. <i>Ibid. </i>As the duty is immediate, so must be the privilege. Furthermore, the exercise of the privilege depends on what the witness reasonably believes will be the future use of a statement. <i>Id., </i>at 445. Again, this indicates the existence of a present right.</p><p>The Clause provides both assurance that a person will not be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding and a continuing right against government conduct intended to bring about self-incrimination. <i>Lefkowitz </i>v. <i>Tur</i>ley, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/70/case.html">414 U. S. 70</a>, 77 (1973) ("The Amendment not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings"); accord, <i>Bram </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/532/case.html">168 U. S. 532</a>,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="792">792</a></p><p>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.</p><p>542-543 (1897); <i>Counselman </i>v. <i>Hitchcock, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/547/case.html">142 U. S. 547</a>, 562 (1892). The principle extends to forbid policies which exert official compulsion that might induce a person into forfeiting his rights under the Clause. <i>Lefkowitz </i>v. <i>Cunningham, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/801/case.html">431 U. S. 801</a>, 806 (1977) ("These cases settle that government cannot penalize assertion of the constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination by imposing sanctions to compel testimony which has not been immunized"); accord, <i>Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. </i>v. <i>Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/280/case.html">392 U. S. 280</a> (1968); <i>Gardner </i>v. <i>Broderick, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/273/case.html">392 U. S. 273</a>, 279 (1968). JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS acknowledge a future privilege. <i>Ante, </i>at 777-778; <i>ante, </i>at 769. That does not end the matter. A future privilege does not negate a present right.</p><p>Their position finds some support in a single statement in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/259/case.html">494 U. S. 259</a>, 264 (1990) ("Although conduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately impair that right [against compelled selfincrimination], a constitutional violation occurs only at trial"). That case concerned the application of the Fourth Amendment, and the extent of the right secured under the Self- Incrimination Clause was not then before the Court. <i>Ibid. </i>Furthermore, <i>Verdugo-Urquidez </i>involved a prosecution in the United States arising from a criminal investigation in another country, <i>id., </i>at 274-275, so there was a special reason for the Court to be concerned about the application of the Clause in that context, <i>id., </i>at 269 (noting the Court had "rejected the claim that aliens are entitled to Fifth Amendment rights outside the sovereign territory of the United States" (citing <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>Eisentrager, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/case.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950))). In any event, the decision cannot be read to support the proposition that the application of the Clause is limited in the way JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS describe today.</p><p>A recent case illustrates that a violation of the SelfIncrimination Clause may have immediate consequences.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="793">793</a></p><p>Just last Term, nine Justices all proceeded from the premise that a present, completed violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause could occur if an incarcerated prisoner were required to admit to past crimes on pain of forfeiting certain privileges or being assigned harsher conditions of confinement. <i>McKune </i>v. <i>Lile, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/24/case.html">536 U. S. 24</a> (2002); <i>id., </i>at 48 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id., </i>at 54 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Although there was disagreement over whether a violation occurred in the circumstances of that case, there was no disagreement that a present violation could have taken place. No Member of the Court suggested that the absence of a pending criminal proceeding made the Self-Incrimination Clause inquiry irrelevant.</p><p>This is not to say all questions as to the meaning and extent of the Clause are simple of resolution, or that all of the cited cases are easy to reconcile. Many questions about the application of the Self-Incrimination Clause are close and difficult. There are instances, moreover, when incriminating statements can be required from a reluctant witness, see, <i>e. g., Gardner, supra, </i>at 276, and others where information may be required even absent a promise of immunity, see, <i>e. g., Shapiro </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/335/1/case.html">335 U. S. 1</a>, 19 (1948). JusTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS are correct to note that testimony may be ordered, on pain of contempt, if appropriate immunity is granted. It does not follow that the Clause establishes no present right. The immunity rule simply shows that the right is not absolute.</p><p>The conclusion that the Self-Incrimination Clause is not violated until the government seeks to use a statement in some later criminal proceeding strips the Clause of an essential part of its force and meaning. This is no small matter. It should come as an unwelcome surprise to judges, attorneys, and the citizenry as a whole that if a legislative committee or a judge in a civil case demands incriminating testimony without offering immunity, and even imposes sanctions for failure to comply, that the witness and counsel can-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="794">794</a></p><p>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.</p><p>not insist the right against compelled self-incrimination is applicable then and there. JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS, I submit, should be more respectful of the understanding that has prevailed for generations now. To tell our whole legal system that when conducting a criminal investigation police officials can use severe compulsion or even torture with no present violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination can only diminish a celebrated provision in the Bill of Rights. A Constitution survives over time because the people share a common, historic commitment to certain simple but fundamental principles which preserve their freedom. Today\'s decision undermines one of those respected precepts.</p><p>Dean Griswold explained the place the Self-Incrimination</p><p>Clause has secured in our legal heritage:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Fifth Amendment has been very nearly a lone sure rock in a time of storm. It has been one thing which has held quite firm, although something like a juggernaut has pushed upon it. It has, thus, through all its vicissitudes, been a symbol of the ultimate moral sense of the community, upholding the best in us, when otherwise there was a good deal of wavering under the pressures of the times." E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 73 (1955).</p></blockquote><p>It damages the law, and the vocabulary with which we impart our legal tradition from one generation to the next, to downgrade our understanding of what the Fifth Amendment requires.</p><p>There is some authority, it must be acknowledged, for the proposition that the act of torturing to obtain a confession is not comprehended within the Self-Incrimination Clause itself. In <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Mississippi, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html">297 U. S. 278</a> (1936), the Court held that convictions based upon tortured confessions could not stand, but it identified the Due Process Clause, and not the Self-Incrimination Clause, as the source for its ruling.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="795">795</a></p><p><i>Id., </i>at 285. The Court interpreted the Self-Incrimination Clause as limited to "the processes of justice by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify. Compulsion by torture to extort a confession is a different matter." <i>Ibid. </i>The decision in <i>Brown </i>antedated the incorporation of the Clause and the ensuing understanding of its fundamental role in our legal system.</p><p>The views expressed by JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE THOMAS also have some academic support. Professor McNaughton, in his revision of Professor Wigmore\'s treatise on the law of evidence, recites various rationales for the SelfIncrimination Clause, declaring all of them insufficient. 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa72251 (J. McNaughton rev. ed. 1961). The 11th justification he discusses is the prevention of torture, <i>id., </i>at 315, a practice Professor McNaughton simply assures us will not be revived, <i>ibid.</i></p><p>This is not convincing. The Constitution is based upon the theory that when past abuses are forbidden the resulting right has present meaning. A police officer\'s interrogation is different in a formal sense from interrogation ordered by an official inquest, but the close relation between the two ought not to be so quickly discounted. Even if some think the abuses of the Star Chamber cannot revive, the specter of Sheriff Screws, see <i>Screws </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/91/case.html">325 U. S. 91</a> (1945), or of the deputies who beat the confessions out of the defendants in <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Mississippi, </i>is not so easily banished. See <i>Oregon </i>v. <i>Elstad, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/case.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, 312, n. 3 (1985); <i>id., </i>at 371-372, n. 19 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>In my view the Self-Incrimination Clause is applicable at the time and place police use compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect. The Clause forbids that conduct. A majority of the Court has now concluded otherwise, but that should not end this case. It simply implicates the larger definition of liberty under the Due Process Clause of the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="796">796</a></p><p>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.</p><p>Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Dickerson, </i>530 U. S., at 433 ("Over time, our cases recognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a confession be voluntary to be admitted into evidence: the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"). Turning to this essential, but less specific, guarantee, it seems to me a simple enough matter to say that use of torture or its equivalent in an attempt to induce a statement violates an individual\'s fundamental right to liberty of the person. <i>Brown, supra, </i>at 285; <i>Palko </i>v. <i>Connecticut, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a> (1937); see also <i>Rochin </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/165/case.html">342 U. S. 165</a> (1952). The Constitution does not countenance the official imposition of severe pain or pressure for purposes of interrogation. This is true whether the protection is found in the Self-Incrimination Clause, the broader guarantees of the Due Process Clause, or both.</p><p>That brings us to the interrogation in this case. Had the officer inflicted the initial injuries sustained by Martinez (the gunshot wounds) for purposes of extracting a statement, there would be a clear and immediate violation of the Constitution, and no further inquiry would be needed. That is not what happened, however. The initial injuries and anguish suffered by the suspect were not inflicted to aid the interrogation. The wounds arose from events preceding it. True, police officers had caused the injuries, but they had not done so to compel a statement or with the purpose of facilitating some later interrogation. The case can be analyzed, then, as if the wounds had been inflicted by some third person, and the officer came to the hospital to interrogate.</p><p>There is no rule against interrogating suspects who are in anguish and pain. The police may have legitimate reasons, borne of exigency, to question a person who is suffering or in distress. Locating the victim of a kidnaping, ascertaining the whereabouts of a dangerous assailant or accomplice, or determining whether there is a rogue police officer at large are some examples. That a suspect is in fear of dying, fur-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="797">797</a></p><p>thermore, may not show compulsion but just the opposite. The fear may be a motivating factor to volunteer information. The words of a declarant who believes his death is imminent have a special status in the law of evidence. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Mattox </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/146/140/case.html">146 U. S. 140</a>, 152 (1892) ("The admission of the testimony is justified upon the ground of necessity, and in view of the consideration that the certain expectation of almost immediate death will remove all temptation to falsehood, and enforce as strict adherence to the truth as the obligation of an oath could impose"); see also Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(2) (providing an exception from the hearsay rule for certain statements uttered under belief of impending death). A declarant in Martinez\'s circumstances may want to tell his story even if it increases his pain and agony to do so. The Constitution does not forbid the police from offering a person an opportunity to volunteer evidence he wishes to reveal.</p><p>There are, however, actions police may not take if the prohibition against the use of coercion to elicit a statement is to be respected. The police may not prolong or increase a suspect\'s suffering against the suspect\'s will. That conduct would render government officials accountable for the increased pain. The officers must not give the impression that severe pain will be alleviated only if the declarant cooperates, for that, too, uses pain to extract a statement. In a case like this one, recovery should be available under \xc2\xa7 1983 if a complainant can demonstrate that an officer exploited his pain and suffering with the purpose and intent of securing an incriminating statement. That showing has been made here.</p><p>The transcript of the interrogation set out by JUSTICE STEVENS, <i>ante, </i>at 784-786 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), and other evidence considered by the District Court demonstrate that the suspect thought his treatment would be delayed, and thus his pain and condition worsened, by refusal to answer questions.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="798">798</a></p><p>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.</p><p>It is true that the interrogation was not continuous. Ten minutes of questions and answers were spread over a 45minute interval. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. Treatment was apparently administered during those interruptions. The pauses in the interrogation, however, do not indicate any error in the trial court\'s findings and conclusions.</p><p>The District Court found that Martinez "had been shot in the face, both eyes were injured; he was screaming in pain, and coming in and out of consciousness while being repeatedly questioned about details of the encounter with the police." <i>Id., </i>at 22a. His blinding facial wounds made it impossible for him visually to distinguish the interrogating officer from the attending medical personnel. The officer made no effort to dispel the perception that medical treatment was being withheld until Martinez answered the questions put to him. There was no attempt through <i>Miranda </i>warnings or other assurances to advise the suspect that his cooperation should be voluntary. Martinez begged the officer to desist and provide treatment for his wounds, but the questioning persisted despite these pleas and despite Martinez\'s unequivocal refusal to answer questions. Cf. <i>Mincey </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/385/case.html">437 U. S. 385</a>, 398 (1978) (Court said of similar circumstances: "It is hard to imagine a situation less conducive to the exercise of a rational intellect and a free will" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p><p>The standards governing the interrogation of suspects and witnesses who suffer severe pain must accommodate the exigencies that law enforcement personnel encounter in circumstances like this case. It is clear enough, however, that the police should take the necessary steps to ensure that there is neither the fact nor the perception that the declarant\'s pain is being used to induce the statement against his will. In this case no reasonable police officer would believe that the law permitted him to prolong or increase pain to obtain a statement. The record supports the ultimate finding that</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="799">799</a></p><p>the officer acted with the intent of exploiting Martinez\'s condition for purposes of extracting a statement.</p><p>Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals that a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1983 has been stated. The other opinions filed today, however, reach different conclusions as to the correct disposition of the case. Were JusTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and I to adhere to our position, there would be no controlling judgment of the Court. In these circumstances, and because a ruling on substantive due process in this case could provide much of the essential protection the Self-Incrimination Clause secures, I join Part II of JUSTICE SOUTER\'S opinion and would remand the case for further consideration.</p><p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>I join Parts II and III of JUSTICE KENNEDY\'S opinion.</p><p>For reasons well stated therein, I would hold that the SelfIncrimination Clause applies at the time and place police use severe compulsion to extract a statement from a suspect. See <i>ante, </i>at 790-798 and this page (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). The evidence in this case, as JUSTICE KENNEDY explains, supports the conclusion "that the suspect thought his treatment would be delayed, and thus his pain and condition worsened, by refusal to answer questions." <i>Ante, </i>at 797. I write separately to state my view that, even if no finding were made concerning Martinez\'s belief that refusal to answer would delay his treatment, or Chavez\'s intent to create such an impression, the interrogation in this case would remain a clear instance of the kind of compulsion no reasonable officer would have thought constitutionally permissible.</p><p>In <i>Mincey </i>v. <i>Arizona, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/385/case.html">437 U.

S., at 398. He was interrogated while "lying on his back on a hospital bed, encumbered by tubes, needles, and breathing apparatus." <i>Id., </i>at 399. Despite the suspect\'s clear and repeated indications that he did not want to talk, the officer persisted in questioning him as he drifted in and out of consciousness. The Court thought it "apparent" in these circumstances that the suspect\'s statements "were not the product of his free and rational choice." <i>Id., </i>at 401 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>Martinez\'s interrogation strikingly resembles the hospitalbed questioning in <i>Mincey. </i>Like the suspect in <i>Mincey, </i>Martinez was "at the complete mercy of [his interrogator], unable to escape or resist the thrust of [the] interrogation." <i>Id., </i>at 399 (internal quotation marks omitted). As JUSTICE KENNEDY notes, Martinez "had been shot in the face, both eyes were injured; he was screaming in pain, and coming in and out of consciousness while being repeatedly questioned about details of the encounter with the police." <i>Ante, </i>at 798 (quoting <i>Martinez </i>v. <i>Oxnard, </i>CV 98-9313 <i>(CD </i>Cal., July 31, 2000), p. 7, App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a). "In this debilitated and helpless condition, [Martinez] clearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated." <i>Mincey, </i>437 U. S., at 399. Chavez nonetheless continued to question him, "ceas[ing] the interrogation only during intervals when [Martinez] lost consciousness or received medical treatment." <i>Id., </i>at 40l. Martinez was "weakened by pain and shock"; "barely conscious, ... his will was simply overborne." <i>Id., </i>at 401-402.</p><p>1 While <i>Mincey </i>concerned admissibility under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, its analysis of the coercive nature of the interrogation is nonetheless instructive in this case.
