There is an exception.  Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[ies] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ccombination\xe2\x80\x9d abroad, a patented invention\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).  This case concerns the applicability of \xc2\xa7271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T holds a patent on a computer used to digitally encode and compress recorded speech.  Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Windows operating system has the potential to infringe that patent because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by the patent.  Microsoft sells Windows to foreign manufacturers who install the software onto the computers they sell.  Microsoft sends each manufacturer a master version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission, which the manufacturer uses to generate copies.  Those copies, not the master version sent by Microsoft, are installed on the foreign manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s computers.  The foreign-made computers are then sold to users abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T filed an infringement suit charging Microsoft with liability for the foreign installations of Windows.  By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT&amp;T contended, Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ccombination\xe2\x80\x9d abroad, \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patented speech-processing computer, and, accordingly, was liable under \xc2\xa7271(f).  Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d of an invention under \xc2\xa7271(f).  Microsoft also urged that the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under \xc2\xa7271(f), and a divided Federal Circuit panel affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies of Windows installed on the foreign-made computers in question, Microsoft does not \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[y] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of those computers, and therefore is not liable under \xc2\xa7271(f) as currently written.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f).  Section 271(f) attaches liability to the supply abroad of the \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents of a patented invention, where <em>such components</em> are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <em>such components</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The provision thus applies only to \xe2\x80\x9csuch components\xe2\x80\x9d as are combined to form the \xe2\x80\x9cpatented invention\xe2\x80\x9d at issue\xe2\x80\x94here<em>,</em> AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s speech-processing computer.  Until expressed as a computer-readable \xe2\x80\x9ccopy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, on a CD-ROM, Windows\xe2\x80\x94indeed any software detached from an activating medium\xe2\x80\x94remains uncombinable.  It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer.  Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s categorization: \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d amenable to \xe2\x80\x9ccombination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is information\xe2\x80\x94a detailed set of instructions\xe2\x80\x94and thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything else containing design information).  A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that it is easy to encode software\xe2\x80\x99s instructions onto a computer-readable medium does not counsel a different answer.  The copy-producing step is what renders software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the extra step is essential.  Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device.  Those tools are not, however, \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of the devices in which the parts are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress might have included within \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s compass, for example, not only a patented invention\xe2\x80\x99s combinable \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cinformation, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.\xe2\x80\x9d  It did not.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Microsoft did not \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[y] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d the foreign-made copies of Windows installed on the computers here involved.  Under a conventional reading of \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, those copies were \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d from outside the United States.  The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that for software components, the act of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying.  A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from exact copies, generated easily, inexpensively, and swiftly from the master.  Hence, sending a single copy of software abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes \xc2\xa7271(f) liability for the foreign-made copies.  Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that \xe2\x80\x9csupplying\xe2\x80\x9d is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent \xe2\x80\x9ccopying,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creplicating,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creproducing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in effect, manufacturing.  He further observed that the only true difference between software components and physical components of other patented inventions is that copies of software are easier to make and transport.  But nothing in \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement.  The Court agrees.  Under \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the very components supplied from the United States, and not foreign-made copies thereof, trigger liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue.   While copying software abroad is indeed easy and inexpensive, the same can be said of other items, such as keys copied from a master.  Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The absence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master dispatched from the United States \xe2\x80\x9csupplies\xe2\x80\x9d the foreign-made copies from this country.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Any doubt that Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s conduct falls outside \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s compass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Foreign conduct is generally the domain of foreign law, and in the patent area, that law may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public.  Applied here, the presumption tugs strongly against construing \xc2\xa7271(f) to encompass as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d not only a physical copy of software, but also software\xe2\x80\x99s intangible code, and to render \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.  Foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries.  If AT&amp;T desires to prevent copying abroad, its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0While reading \xc2\xa7271(f) to exclude from coverage foreign-made copies of software may create a \xe2\x80\x9cloophole\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of software makers, the Court is not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of \xc2\xa7271(f) is in order; the \xe2\x80\x9cloophole\xe2\x80\x9d is properly left for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such action warranted.  Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in U. S. patent law revealed by <em>Deepsouth Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Laitram Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/518/index.html">406 U. S. 518</a>,<em> </em>where the items exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign buyers.  Having attended to that gap, Congress did not address other arguable gaps, such as the loophole AT&amp;T describes.  Given the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7271(f) entails, the patent-protective determination AT&amp;T seeks must be left to Congress.<em> </em>Cf.<em> Sony Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/417/index.html">464 U. S. 417</a>, 431.  Congress is doubtless aware of the ease with which electronic media such as software can be copied, and has not left the matter untouched.  See the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71201 <em>et seq</em>.  If patent law is to be adjusted better to account for the realities of software distribution, the alteration should be made after focused legislative consideration, not by the Judiciary forecasting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely disposition.

There is an exception.  Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one \xe2\x80\x9csupplies . . . from the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ccombination\xe2\x80\x9d abroad, a patented invention\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7271(f)(1).  This case concerns the applicability of \xc2\xa7271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T holds a patent on an apparatus for digitally encoding and compressing recorded speech.  Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Windows operating system, it is conceded, has the potential to infringe AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patent, because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by that patent.  It bears emphasis, however, that uninstalled Windows software does not infringe AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patent any more than a computer standing alone does; instead, the patent is infringed only when a computer is loaded with Windows and is thereby rendered capable of performing as the patented speech processor.  The question before us: Does Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s liability extend to computers made in another country when loaded with Windows software copied abroad from a master disk or electronic transmission dispatched by Microsoft from the United States?  Our answer is \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The master disk or electronic transmission Microsoft sends from the United States is never installed on any of the foreign-made computers in question.  Instead, copies made abroad are used for installation.  Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies actually installed, it does not \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[y] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant computers, and therefore is not liable under \xc2\xa7271(f) as currently written.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plausible arguments can be made for and against extending \xc2\xa7271(f) to the conduct charged in this case as infringing AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  Recognizing that \xc2\xa7271(f) is an exception to the general rule that our patent law does not apply extraterritorially, we resist giving the language in which Congress cast \xc2\xa7271(f) an expansive interpretation.  Our decision leaves to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 informed judgment any adjustment of \xc2\xa7271(f) it deems necessary or proper.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision some 35 years ago in <em>Deepsouth Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Laitram Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/518/index.html"></a><a href="/us/406/518/index.html">406 U. S. 518</a> (1972), a case about a shrimp deveining machine, led Congress to enact \xc2\xa7271(f).  In that case, Laitram, holder of a patent on the time-and-expense-saving machine, sued Deepsouth, manufacturer of an infringing deveiner.  Deepsouth conceded that the Patent Act barred it from making and selling its deveining machine in the United States, but sought to salvage a portion of its business: Nothing in United States patent law, Deepsouth urged, stopped it from making in the United States the <em>parts</em> of its deveiner, as opposed to the machine itself, and selling those <em>parts</em> to foreign buyers for assembly and use abroad.  <em>Id.</em>, at 522\xe2\x80\x93524.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We agreed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreting our patent law as then written, we reiterated in <em>Deepsouth</em> that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 527; see 35 U.

(\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hoever without authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Deepsouth\xe2\x80\x99s foreign buyers did not infringe Laitram\xe2\x80\x99s patent, we held, because they assembled and used the deveining machines outside the United States.  Deepsouth, we therefore concluded, could not be charged with inducing or contributing to an infringement.  406 U. S., at 526\xe2\x80\x93527.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Nor could Deepsouth be held liable as a direct infringer, for it did not make, sell, or use the patented invention\xe2\x80\x94the fully assembled deveining machine\xe2\x80\x94within the United States.  The parts of the machine were not themselves patented, we noted, hence export of those parts, unassembled, did not rank as an infringement of Laitram\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  <em>Id</em>., at 527\xe2\x80\x93529.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Laitram had argued in <em>Deepsouth</em> that resistance to extension of the patent privilege to cover exported parts \xe2\x80\x9cderived from too narrow and technical an interpretation of the [Patent Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 529.  Rejecting that argument, we referred to prior decisions holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca combination patent protects only against the operable assembly of the whole and not the manufacture of its parts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 528.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 codification of patent law, we said, signaled no intention to broaden the scope of the privilege.  <em>Id</em>., at 530 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, as here, the Constitution is permissive, the sign of how far Congress has chosen to go can come only from Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we again emphasized that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect; these acts of Congress do not, and were not intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United States; and we correspondingly reject the claims of others to such control over our markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 531 (quoting <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Duchesne</em>, 19 How. 183, 195 (1857)).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAbsent \xe2\x80\x9ca clear congressional indication of intent,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, courts had no warrant to stop the manufacture and sale of the parts of patented inventions for assembly and use abroad.  406 U.

Microsoft stipulated that by installing Windows on its own computers during the software development process, it directly infringed the \xe2\x80\x99580 patent.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Microsoft further acknowledged that by licensing copies of Windows to manufacturers of computers sold in the United States, it induced infringement of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patent.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 42a; Brief for Petitioner 3\xe2\x80\x934; Brief for Respondent 9, 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Microsoft denied, however, any liability based on the master disks and electronic transmissions it dispatched to foreign manufacturers, thus joining issue with AT&amp;T.  By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT&amp;T contended, Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ccombination\xe2\x80\x9d abroad, \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s patented speech processor; accordingly, AT&amp;T urged, Microsoft was liable under \xc2\xa7271(f).  See <em>supra</em>, at 5 (reproducing text of \xc2\xa7271(f)).  Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d of an invention under \xc2\xa7271(f).  In any event, Microsoft urged, the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under \xc2\xa7271(f).  71 USPQ 2d 1118 (SDNY 2004).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.  414 F.\xc2\xa03d 1366 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case poses two questions: First, when, or in what form, does software qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f)?  Second, were \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the United States\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first<em> </em>question, no one in this litigation argues that software can <em>never</em> rank as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f).  The parties disagree, however, over the stage at which software becomes a component.  Software, the \xe2\x80\x9cset of instructions, known as code, that directs a computer to perform specified functions or operations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fantasy Sports Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sportsline.com, Inc.</em>, 287 F.\xc2\xa03d 1108, 1118 (CA Fed. 2002), can be conceptualized in (at least) two ways.  One can speak of software in the abstract: the instructions themselves detached from any medium.  (An analogy: The notes of Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth Symphony.)  One can alternatively envision a tangible \xe2\x80\x9ccopy\xe2\x80\x9d of software, the instructions encoded on a medium such as a CD-ROM.  (Sheet music for Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth.)  AT&amp;T argues that software in the abstract, not simply a particular copy of software, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f).  Microsoft and the United States argue that only a copy of software, not software in the abstract, can be a component.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The significance of these diverse views becomes apparent when we turn to the second question: Were components of the foreign-made computers involved in this case \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the United States\xe2\x80\x9d?  If the relevant components are the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers, AT&amp;T could not persuasively argue that those components, though generated abroad, were \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d as \xc2\xa7271(f) requires for liability to attach.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  If, on the other hand, Windows in the abstract qualifies as a component within \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s compass, it would not matter that the master copies of Windows software dispatched from the United States were not themselves installed abroad as working parts of the foreign computers.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this explanation of the relationship between the two questions in view, we further consider the twin inquiries.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, when, or in what form, does software become a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f)?  We construe \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s terms \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with [their] ordinary or natural meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FDIC</em> v. <em>Meyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/471/index.html">510 U. S. 471</a>, 476 (1994).  Section 271(f) applies to the supply abroad of the \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents of a patented invention, where <em>such components</em> are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <em>such components</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The provision thus applies only to \xe2\x80\x9csuch components\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] as are combined to form the \xe2\x80\x9cpatented invention\xe2\x80\x9d at issue.  The patented invention here is AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s speech-processing computer.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until it is expressed as a computer-readable \xe2\x80\x9ccopy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, on a CD-ROM, Windows software\xe2\x80\x94indeed any software detached from an activating medium\xe2\x80\x94remains uncombinable.  It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer.  Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s categorization: \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d amenable to \xe2\x80\x9ccombination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is information\xe2\x80\x94a detailed set of instructions\xe2\x80\x94and thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything containing design information, <em>e.g.</em>, a schematic, template, or prototype).  A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component of that device.  AT&amp;T and its <em>amici</em> do not suggest otherwise.  Cf. <em>Pellegrini</em> v. <em>Analog Devices, Inc.</em>, 375 F.\xc2\xa03d 1113, 1117\xe2\x80\x931119 (CA Fed. 2004) (transmission abroad of instructions for production of patented computer chips not covered by \xc2\xa7271(f)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T urges that software, at least when expressed as machine-readable object code, is distinguishable from design information presented in a blueprint.  Software, unlike a blueprint, is \xe2\x80\x9cmodular\xe2\x80\x9d; it is a stand-alone product developed and marketed \xe2\x80\x9cfor use on many different types of computer hardware and in conjunction with many other types of software.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  Software\xe2\x80\x99s modularity persists even after installation; it can be updated or removed (deleted) without affecting the hardware on which it is installed.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Software, unlike a blueprint, is also \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  After a device has been built according to a blueprint\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, the blueprint\xe2\x80\x99s work is done (as AT&amp;T puts it, the blueprint\xe2\x80\x99s instructions have been \xe2\x80\x9cexhausted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.).  Software\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, in contrast, are contained in and continuously performed by a computer.  Brief for Respondent 27\xe2\x80\x9328; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  See also <em>Eolas Technologies Inc. </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp.</em>, 399 F. 3d 1325, 1339 (CA Fed. 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]oftware code \xe2\x80\xa6 drives the functional nucleus of the finished computer product.\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Imagexpo, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C. </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp.</em>, 299 F. Supp. 2d 550, 553 (ED Va. 2003))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinctions advanced by AT&amp;T do not persuade us to characterize software, uncoupled from a medium, as a combinable component.  Blueprints too, or any design information for that matter, can be independently developed, bought, and sold.  If the point of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that we do not see blueprints lining stores\xe2\x80\x99 shelves, the same observation may be made about software in the abstract: What retailers sell, and consumers buy, are <em>copies </em>of software.  Likewise, before software can be contained in and continuously performed by a computer, before it can be updated or deleted, an actual, physical copy of the software must be delivered by CD-ROM or some other means capable of interfacing with the computer.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because it is so easy to encode software\xe2\x80\x99s instructions onto a medium that can be read by a computer, AT&amp;T intimates, that extra step should not play a decisive role under \xc2\xa7271(f).  But the extra step is what renders the software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the copy-producing step is essential.  Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device.  A machine for making sprockets might be used by a manufacturer to produce tens of thousands of sprockets an hour.  That does not make the machine a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d of the tens of thousands of devices in which the sprockets are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress, of course, might have included within \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s compass, for example, not only combinable \xe2\x80\x9ccomponents\xe2\x80\x9d of a patented invention, but also \xe2\x80\x9cinformation, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.\xe2\x80\x9d  It did not.  In sum, a copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7271(f).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next question, has Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d components of the computers here involved?  Under a conventional reading of \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the answer would be \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d for the foreign-made copies of Windows actually installed on the computers were \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d from places outside the United States.  The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cfor software \xe2\x80\x98components,\xe2\x80\x99 the act of copying is subsumed in the act of \xe2\x80\x98supplying.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1370.  A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from the exact copies, easily, inexpensively, and swiftly generated from the master; hence \xe2\x80\x9csending a single copy abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes \xc2\xa7271(f) liability for th[e] foreign-made copies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> cf. <em>post</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of components \xe2\x80\xa6 that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that \xe2\x80\x9csupplying\xe2\x80\x9d is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent \xe2\x80\x9ccopying, replicating, or reproducing\xe2\x80\x94in effect manufacturing.\xe2\x80\x9d  414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1372\xe2\x80\x931373 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>id</em>., at 1373 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]opying and supplying are separate acts with different consequences\xe2\x80\x94particularly when the \xe2\x80\x98<f f="Century Schoolbook Greek">supplying\xe2\x80\x99 occurs in the United States and the copying occurs in Dsseldorf or Tokyo.

But nothing in \xc2\xa7271(f)\xe2\x80\x99s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement.  See <em>ibid</em>.  We agree.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 271(f) prohibits the supply of components \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 in such manner as to actively induce the combination of <em>such components</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(f)(1) (emphasis added).  Under this formulation, the very components supplied from the United States, and not copies thereof, trigger \xc2\xa7271(f) liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue.  Here, as we have repeatedly noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 5\xe2\x80\x936, the copies of Windows actually installed on the foreign computers were not themselves supplied from the United States.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Indeed, those copies did not exist until they were generated by third parties outside the United States.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Copying software abroad, all might agree, is indeed easy and inexpensive.  But the same could be said of other items: \xe2\x80\x9cKeys or machine parts might be copied from a master; chemical or biological substances might be created by reproduction; and paper products might be made by electronic copying and printing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 24.  See also <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (rejecting argument similarly based on ease of copying in construing \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d).

See <em>supra</em>, at 2, 4.  The presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world applies with particular force in patent law.  The traditional understanding that our patent law \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] only domestically and d[oes] not extend to foreign activities,\xe2\x80\x9d Fisch &amp; Allen, <em>supra</em>, at 559, is embedded in the Patent Act itself, which provides that a patent confers exclusive rights in an invention within the United States.  35 U.

Thus, the United States accurately conveyed in this case: \xe2\x80\x9cForeign conduct is [generally] the domain of foreign law,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the area here involved, in particular, foreign law \xe2\x80\x9cmay embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public in patented inventions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 28.  Applied to this case, the presumption tugs strongly against construction of \xc2\xa7271(f) to encompass as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d not only a physical copy of software, but also software\xe2\x80\x99s intangible code, and to render \xe2\x80\x9csupplie[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T argues that the presumption is inapplicable because Congress enacted \xc2\xa7271(f) specifically to extend the reach of United States patent law to cover certain activity abroad.  But as this Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption is not defeated \xe2\x80\xa6 just because [a statute] specifically addresses [an] issue of extraterritorial application,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/197/index.html">507 U.

AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s reading, however, \xe2\x80\x9cconverts a single act of supply from the United States into a springboard for liability each time a copy of the software is subsequently made [abroad] and combined with computer hardware [abroad] for sale [abroad.]\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 29; see 414 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1373, 1375 (Rader, J., dissenting).  In short, foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries.  If AT&amp;T desires to prevent copying in foreign countries, its remedy today lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents.  See <em>Deepsouth</em>, 406 U.

Liability for infringing a United States patent could be avoided, as Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s practice shows, by an easily arranged circumvention: Instead of making installation copies of software in the United States, the copies can be made abroad, swiftly and at small cost, by generating them from a master supplied from the United States.

In <em>Deepsouth</em>, the items exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a shrimp deveining machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign buyers.  Having attended to the gap made evident in <em>Deepsouth</em>, Congress did not address other arguable gaps: Section 271(f) does not identify as an infringing act conduct in the United States that facilitates making a component of a patented invention outside the United States; nor does the provision check \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[ying] \xe2\x80\xa6 from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d information, instructions, or other materials needed to make copies abroad.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Given that Congress did not home in on the loophole AT&amp;T describes, and in view of the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7271(f) entails, our precedent leads us to leave in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 court the patent-protective determination AT&amp;T seeks.<em> </em>Cf.<em> Sony Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Universal City Studios, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/417/index.html">464 U.

This is because the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent,\xe2\x80\x9d when concerning a physical device, is most naturally read to mean a physical part of the device.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 466 (1976) (component is a \xe2\x80\x9cconstituent part: Ingredient\xe2\x80\x9d); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 301 (1967) (component is a \xe2\x80\x9ca component part; constituent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, \xc2\xa7271(f) requires that the component be \xe2\x80\x9ccombined\xe2\x80\x9d with other components to form the infringing device, meaning that the component must remain a part of any.  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s, <em>supra,</em> at 452 (combine means \xe2\x80\x9cto join in physical or chemical union\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cto become one\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cto unite into a chemical compound\xe2\x80\x9d); Random House, <em>supra,</em> at 293 (combine means \xe2\x80\x9cto bring or join into a close union or whole\xe2\x80\x9d).  For these reasons, I agree with the Court that a set of instructions on how to build an infringing device, or even a template of the device, does not qualify as a component.  <em>Ante, </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the parties agree, an inventor can patent a machine that carries out a certain process, and a computer may constitute such a machine when it executes commands\xe2\x80\x94given to it by code\xe2\x80\x94that allow it to carry out that process.  Such a computer would not become an infringing device until enough of the code is installed on the computer to allow it to execute the process in question.  The computer would not be an infringing device prior to the installation, or even during the installation.  And the computer remains an infringing device after the installation process because, even though the original installation device (such as a CD-ROM) has been removed from the computer, the code remains on the hard drive.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, Windows software originating in the United States was sent abroad, whether on a master disk or by means of an electronic transmission, and eventually copied onto the hard drives of the foreign-made computers.  Once the copying process was completed, the Windows program was recorded in a physical form, <em>i.e.</em>, in magnetic fields on the computers\xe2\x80\x99 hard drives.  See Brief for Respondent 5.  The physical form of the Windows program on the master disk, <em>i.e.</em>, the engravings on the CD-ROM, remained on the disk in a form unchanged by the copying process.  See Brief for Petitioner 4, n.\xc2\xa02 (citing White, How Computers Work, at 144\xe2\x80\x93145, 172\xe2\x80\x93173).  There is nothing in the record to suggest that any physical part of the disk became a physical part of the foreign-made computer, and such an occurrence would be contrary to the general workings of computers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because no physical object originating in the United States was combined with these computers, there was no violation of \xc2\xa7271(f).  Accordingly, it is irrelevant that the Windows software was not copied onto the foreign-made computers <em>directly</em> from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the United States.  To be sure, if these computers could not run Windows without inserting and keeping a CD-ROM in the appropriate drive, then the CD-ROMs might be components of the computer.  But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the physical incarnation of code on the Windows CD-ROM supplied from the United States is not a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d of an infringing device under \xc2\xa7271(f), it logically follows that a copy of such a CD-ROM also is not a component.

Strong policy considerations, buttressed by the presumption against the application of domestic patent law in foreign markets, support Microsoft Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s position.  I am, however, persuaded that an affirmance\nof the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment is more faithful to\nthe intent of the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7271(f) than a reversal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision was a response to our decision in <em>Deepsouth Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Laitram Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/518/index.html">406 U. S. 518</a> (1972), holding that a patent on a shrimp deveining machine had not been infringed by the export of components for assembly abroad.  Paragraph (1) of \xc2\xa7271(f) would have been sufficient on its own to overrule <em>Deepsouth</em>,*<footcall num="*"> but it is paragraph (2) that best supports AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s position here.  It provides:</footcall></p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(f)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\nUnder this provision, the export of a specially designed knife that has no use other than as a part of a patented deveining machine would constitute infringement.  It follows that \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) would cover the export of an inventory of such knives to be warehoused until used to complete the assembly of an infringing machine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant component in this case is not a physical item like a knife.  Both Microsoft and the Court think that means it cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 10.  But if a disk with software inscribed on it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent,\xe2\x80\x9d I find it difficult to understand why the most important ingredient of that component is not also a component.  Indeed, the master disk is the functional equivalent of a warehouse of components\xe2\x80\x94components that Microsoft fully expects to be incorporated into foreign-manufactured computers.  Put somewhat differently: On the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, Microsoft could be liable under \xc2\xa7271(f) only if it sends individual copies of its software directly from the United States with the intent that each copy would be incorporated into a separate infringing computer.  But it seems to me that an indirect transmission via a master disk warehouse is likewise covered by \xc2\xa7271(f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that because software is analogous to an abstract set of instructions, it cannot be regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7271(f).  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Whether attached or detached from any medium, software plainly satisfies the dictionary definition of that word.  See <em>ante,</em> at 9, n.\xc2\xa011 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]omponent\xe2\x80\x99 is commonly defined as \xe2\x80\x98a constituent part,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98element,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98ingredient\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  And unlike a blueprint that merely instructs<em> </em>a user how to do something, software actually causes infringing conduct to occur.  It is more like a roller that causes a player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells a pianist what to do.  Moreover, it is surely not \xe2\x80\x9ca staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \xc2\xa7271(f)(2).  On the contrary, its sole intended use is an infringing use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U.
