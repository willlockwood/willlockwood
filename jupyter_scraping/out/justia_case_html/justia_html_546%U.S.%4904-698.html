Assigning the burden to schools might encourage them to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence, but IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  There is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on IDEA administration, and Congress has repeatedly amended the Act to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  The Act also does not support petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion, in effect, that every IEP should be assumed to be invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71400 <em>et seq.</em> (main ed. and Supp. 2005), is a Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9call children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A).  Under IDEA, school districts must create an \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized education program\xe2\x80\x9d (IEP) for each disabled child.  \xc2\xa71414(d).  If parents believe their child\xe2\x80\x99s IEP is inappropriate, they may request an \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial due process hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress first passed IDEA as part of the Education of the Handicapped Act in 1970, 84 Stat. 175, and amended it substantially in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773.  At the time the majority of disabled children in America were \xe2\x80\x9ceither totally excluded from schools or sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \xe2\x80\x98drop out,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93332, p.\xc2\xa02 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.  See Dept. of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System, http://www.ideadata.org/tables27th/ar_ aa9.htm (as visited Nov. 9, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IDEA is \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently described as a model of \xe2\x80\x98cooperative federalism.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Little Rock School Dist. </em>v. <em>Mauney</em>, 183 F. 3d 816, 830 (CA8 1999).  It \xe2\x80\x9cleaves to the States the primary responsibility for developing and executing educational programs for handicapped children, [but] imposes significant requirements to be followed in the discharge of that responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/176/index.html">458 U. S. 176</a>, 183 (1982).  For example, the Act mandates cooperation and reporting between state and federal educational authorities.  Participating States must certify to the Secretary of Education that they have \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d that will effectively meet the Act\xe2\x80\x99s conditions.  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71412(a). (Unless otherwise noted, all citations to the Act are to the pre-2004 version of the statute because this is the version that was in effect during the proceedings below.  We note, however, that nothing in the recent 2004 amendments, 118 Stat. 2674, appears to materially affect the rule announced here.)  State educational agencies, in turn, must ensure that local schools and teachers are meeting the State\xe2\x80\x99s educational standards.  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71412(a)(11), 1412(a)(15)(A).  Local educational agencies (school boards or other administrative bodies) can receive IDEA funds only if they certify to a state educational agency that they are acting in accordance with the State\xe2\x80\x99s policies and procedures. \xc2\xa71413(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.  <em>Rowley, supra</em>, at 205\xe2\x80\x93206 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard\xe2\x80\x9d).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71414(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c), develop an IEP for each one, \xc2\xa71414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, \xc2\xa71414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the child\xe2\x80\x99s current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  \xc2\xa71414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of \xe2\x80\x9cIEP teams.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, \xc2\xa71415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, \xc2\xa71415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative \xe2\x80\x9cimpartial due process hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 108\xe2\x80\x93185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, \xc2\xa71415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth \xe2\x80\x9ca description of the nature of the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and \xe2\x80\x9ca proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may \xe2\x80\x9cpresent evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(h)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brian\xe2\x80\x99s mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brian\xe2\x80\x99s parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brian\xe2\x80\x99s parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brian\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent private education.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.  <em>Brian S. </em>v. <em>Vance</em>, 86 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 538 (2000). <em> </em>Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brian\xe2\x80\x99s parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in \xe2\x80\x9cequipoise,\xe2\x80\x9d and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to \xe2\x80\x9cdepart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  377 F.\xc2\xa03d 449, 453 (2004).  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1145/index.html">543 U. S. 1145</a> (2005), to resolve the following question: At an administrative hearing assessing the appropriateness of an IEP, which party bears the burden of persuasion?</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cburden of proof\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the \xe2\x80\x9cslipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of production,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.  <em>Director, Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs</em> v. <em>Greenwich Collieries,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/267/index.html">512 U. S. 267</a>, 272 (1994).  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick \xc2\xa7337, at 412 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence \xc2\xa73.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 <em>et seq.</em>, does not directly state that plaintiffs bear the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate\xe2\x80\x9d burden of persuasion, but we have so concluded.  <em>St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Center</em> v. <em>Hicks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/502/index.html">509 U. S. 502</a>, 511 (1993); <em>id.,</em> at 531 (Souter, J., dissenting).  In numerous other areas, we have presumed or held that the default rule applies.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 561 (1992) (standing); <em>Cleveland</em> v. <em>Policy Management Systems Corp., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/795/index.html">526 U. S. 795</a>, 806 (1999) (Americans with Disabilities Act); <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>Cromartie, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/541/index.html">526 U. S. 541</a>, 553 (1999) (equal protection); <em>Wharf (Holdings) Ltd.</em> v. <em>United Int\xe2\x80\x99l Holdings, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/588/index.html">532 U.

Congress also expressed its approval of the general rule when it chose to apply it to administrative proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7556(d); see also <em>Greenwich Collieries,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 271.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions.  See McCormick \xc2\xa7337, at 412\xe2\x80\x93415.  For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plantiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Morton Salt Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/37/index.html">334 U. S. 37</a>, 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (1948).  Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant.  See <em>Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation</em> v. <em>EPA, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/461/index.html">540 U. S. 461</a>, 494 (2004).  But while the normal default rule does not solve all cases, it certainly solves most of them.  Decisions that place the <em>entire </em>burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the <em>outset</em> of a proceeding\xe2\x80\x94as petitioners urge us to do here\xe2\x80\x94are extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend first that a close reading of IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s text compels a conclusion in their favor.  They urge that we should interpret the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d in light of their constitutional meaning, and apply the balancing test established by <em>Mathews</em> v. <em>Eldridge,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/index.html">424 U. S. 319</a> (1976).  Even assuming that the Act incorporates constitutional due process doctrine, <em>Eldridge </em>is no help to petitioners, because \xe2\x80\x9c[o]utside the criminal law area, where special concerns attend, the locus of the burden of persuasion is normally not an issue of federal constitutional moment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lavine</em> v. <em>Milne,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/577/index.html">424 U.

IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s drafters were admittedly guided \xe2\x80\x9cto a significant extent\xe2\x80\x9d by these two landmark cases.  <em>Rowley,</em> 458 U. S., at 194.  As the court below noted, however, the fact that Congress \xe2\x80\x9ctook a number of the procedural safeguards from <em>PARC</em> and <em>Mills</em> and wrote them directly into the Act\xe2\x80\x9d does not allow us to \xe2\x80\x9cconclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to write into the text of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  377 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 455.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 1999\xe2\x80\x932000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 105\xe2\x80\x9317, \xc2\xa7615(e), 111 Stat. 90, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(e).  In 2004,\nCongress added a mandatory \xe2\x80\x9cresolution session\xe2\x80\x9d prior\nto any due process hearing.  Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L.\n108\xe2\x80\x93446, \xc2\xa7615(7)(f)(1)(B),  118 Stat. 2720, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(B) (Supp. 2005).  It also made new findings that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]arents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]eachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71400(c)(8)\xe2\x80\x93(9).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cstay-put\xe2\x80\x9d provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her \xe2\x80\x9cthen-current educational placement\xe2\x80\x9d during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. \xc2\xa71415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent<em> </em>requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Act\xe2\x80\x99s procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See <em>Rowley, supra</em>, at 206 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 most plausible argument is that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ordinary rule, based on considerations of fairness, does not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/253/index.html">355 U. S. 253</a>, 256, n. 5 (1957); see also <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Products of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/602/index.html">508 U. S. 602</a>, 626 (1993).  But this \xe2\x80\x9crule is far from being universal, and has many qualifications upon its application.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Greenleaf\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em> v. <em>Birth,</em> 6 Pet. 302, 312 (1832); see also McCormick \xc2\xa7337, at 413 (\xe2\x80\x9cVery often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof\xe2\x80\x9d).  School districts have a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural advantage\xe2\x80\x9d in information and expertise, but Congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them.  See <em>School Comm. of Burlington</em> v. <em>Department of Ed. of Mass.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/359/index.html">471 U. S. 359</a>, 368 (1985).  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. \xc2\xa71415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a \xe2\x80\x9cparent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  34 CFR \xc2\xa7300.502(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.  Pub. L. 108\xe2\x80\x93446, \xc2\xa7615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I), 118 Stat. 2718, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) (Supp. 2005).  Prior to a hearing, the parties must disclose evaluations and recommendations that they intend to rely upon.  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(f)(2).  IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See \xc2\xa71415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees if they prevail.  \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least under some circumstances.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 290\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x93.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, \xc2\xa752.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, \xc2\xa73140 (1999).  Because no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue today.  Justice Breyer contends that the allocation of the burden ought to be left <em>entirely</em> up to the States.  But neither party made this argument before this Court or the courts below.  We therefore decline to address it.</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1" i="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand: The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.  In this case, that party is Brian, as represented by his parents.  But the rule applies with equal effect to school districts: If they seek to challenge an IEP, they will in turn bear the burden of persuasion before an ALJ.

No. 94\xe2\x80\x93168, pp.\xc2\xa06, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1975); <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of District of Columbia</em>, 348 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 866 (DC 1972); <em>Pennsylvania Assn. for Retarded Children</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1257 (ED Pa. 1971), and 343 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 279 (ED Pa. 1972).  Under typical civil rights and social welfare legislation, the complaining party must allege and prove discrimination or qualification for statutory benefits.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Center</em> v. <em>Hicks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/502/index.html">509 U.

The IDEA is atypical in this respect: It casts an affirmative, beneficiary-specific obligation on providers of public education.

Curiously, the Court next suggests that resources spent on developing IEPs rank as \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d not as expenditures for \xe2\x80\x9ceducational services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

Not until the District Court ruled that the school district had the burden of persuasion did the school design an IEP that met Brian Schaffer\xe2\x80\x99s special educational needs.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (Counsel for the Schaffers observed that \xe2\x80\x9cMontgomery County \xe2\x80\xa6 gave [Brian] the kind of services he had sought from the beginning \xe2\x80\xa6 once [the school district was] given the burden of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d).

True, Congress did not require that \xe2\x80\x9ca child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court observes that decisions placing \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>entire</em> burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the <em>outset</em> of a proceeding \xe2\x80\xa6 are extremely rare.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.  It must be borne <em>entirely</em> by one side or the other:  Either the school district must establish the adequacy of the IEP it has proposed or the parents must demonstrate the plan\xe2\x80\x99s inadequacy.  </p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Before the Fourth Circuit, the United States filed in favor of the Schaffers; in this Court, the United States supported Montgomery County.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961989">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSCHAFFER V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400 <em>et seq.</em>, requires school districts to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify and evaluate disabled children, \xe2\x80\xa6 develop an [Individualized Education Program] for each one \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, and review every IEP at least once a year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion of the Court).  A parent dissatisfied with \xe2\x80\x9cany matter relating [1] to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child,\xe2\x80\x9d or [2] to the \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d of the child, has the opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto resolve such disputes through a mediation process.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(a), (b)(6)(A), (k) (Supp. 2005).  The Act further provides the parent with \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity for an impartial due process hearing\xe2\x80\x9d provided by the state or local education agency.  \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(A).  If provided locally, either party can appeal the hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the state educational agency.  \xc2\xa71415(g).  Finally, the Act allows any \xe2\x80\x9cparty aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d by the results of the state hearing(s), \xe2\x80\x9cto bring a civil action\xe2\x80\x9d in a federal district court.  \xc2\xa71415(i)(2)(A).  In sum, the Act provides for school board action, followed by (1) mediation, (2) an impartial state due process hearing with the possibility of state appellate review, and, (3) federal district court review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act also sets forth minimum procedures that the parties, the hearing officer, and the federal court must follow.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71415(f)(1) (notice); \xc2\xa71415(f)(2) (disclosures); \xc2\xa71415(f)(3) (limitations on who may conduct the hearing); \xc2\xa71415(g) (right to appeal); \xc2\xa71415(h)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be accompanied and advised by counsel\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71415(h)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe right to present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71415(h)(3) (the right to a transcript of the proceeding); \xc2\xa71415(h)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe right to written \xe2\x80\xa6 findings of fact and decisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Despite this detailed procedural scheme, the Act is silent on the question of who bears the burden of persuasion at the state \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s silence suggests that Congress did not think about the matter of the burden of persuasion.  It is, after all, a relatively minor issue that should not often arise.  That is because the parties will ordinarily introduce considerable evidence (as in this case where the initial 3-day hearing included testimony from 10 witnesses, 6 qualified as experts, and more than 50 exhibits).  And judges rarely hesitate to weigh evidence, even highly technical evidence, and to decide a matter on the merits, even when the case is a close one.  Thus, cases in which an administrative law judge (ALJ) finds the evidence in precise equipoise should be few and far between. Cf. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</em> v. <em>McAninch,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/432/index.html">513 U. S. 432</a>, 436\xe2\x80\x93437 (1995). See also Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108\xe2\x80\x93446, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7615(f)(3)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(iv), 118 Stat. 2721, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(f)(3)(A)(ii)\xe2\x80\x93(iv) (Supp. 2005) (requiring appointment of ALJ with technical capacity to understand Act). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the hearing officer held that before him was that <em>rara avis</em>\xe2\x80\x94a case of perfect evidentiary equipoise.  Hence we must infer from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence (and from the rest of the statutory scheme) which party\xe2\x80\x94the parents or the school district\xe2\x80\x94bears the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can reasonably argue, as the Court holds, that the risk of nonpersuasion should fall upon the \xe2\x80\x9cindividual desiring change.\xe2\x80\x9d  That, after all, is the rule courts ordinarily apply when an individual complains about the lawfulness of a government action. <em>E.g., ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of the Court); 377 F.\xc2\xa03d 449 (CA4 2004) (case below); <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Indian River County School Bd.</em>, 249 F.\xc2\xa03d 1289 (CA11 2001).  On the other hand, one can reasonably argue to the contrary, that, given the technical nature of the subject matter, its human importance, the school district\xe2\x80\x99s superior resources, and the district\xe2\x80\x99s superior access to relevant information, the risk of nonpersuasion ought to fall upon the district.  <em>E.g., ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x935 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); 377 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 456\xe2\x80\x93459 (Luttig, J., dissenting); <em>Oberti</em> v. <em>Board of Ed.,</em> 995 F.\xc2\xa02d 1204 (CA3 1993); <em>Lascari </em>v.<em> Board of Ed.</em>, 116 N.\xc2\xa0J. 30, 560 A.\xc2\xa02d 1180 (1980).  My own view is that Congress took neither approach.  It did not decide the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d question; instead it left the matter to the States for decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act says that the \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures\xe2\x80\x9d is a matter for the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d and its agencies<em>.</em>  \xc2\xa71415(a).  It adds that the hearing in question, an administrative hearing, is to be conducted by the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clocal educational agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71415(f)(1)(A) (Supp. 2005).  And the statute as a whole foresees state implementation of  federal standards.  \xc2\xa71412(a); <em>Cedar Rapids Community School Dist.</em> v. <em>Garret F., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/66/index.html">526 U. S. 66</a>, 68 (1999); <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/176/index.html">458 U. S. 176</a>, 208 (1982).  The minimum federal procedural standards that the Act specifies are unrelated to the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d question.  And different States, consequently and not surprisingly, have resolved it in different ways.<em> </em>See, <em>e.g.</em>, Alaska Admin. Code, tit. 4, \xc2\xa752.550(e)(9) (2003) (school district bears burden); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 290\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x939.08(8)(c)(6)(ii)(I) (Supp. 2004); (same); Conn.

Code Rules \xc2\xa7126\xe2\x80\x9316\xe2\x80\x938.1.11(c) (2005) (same); Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 511, 7\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x933 (2003) (incorporating by reference Ind. Code \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x9321.5\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x9314 (West 2002)) (moving party bears burden); 7 Ky. Admin. Regs., tit. 707, ch. 1:340, Section 7(4) (2004) (incorporating by reference Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713B.090(7) (Lexis 2003)) (same); Ga. Comp. Rules &amp; Regs., Rule 160\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x93.18(1)(g)(8) (2002) (burden varies depending upon remedy sought); Minn. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7125A.091, subd. 16 (West Supp. 2005) (same).  There is no indication that this lack of uniformity has proved harmful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing in the Act suggests a need to fill every interstice of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme with a uniform federal rule. See <em>Kamen</em> v. <em>Kemper Financial Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/90/index.html">500 U. S. 90</a>, 98 (1991) (citations omitted).  And should some such need arise\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, if non-uniformity or a particular state approach were to prove problematic\xe2\x80\x94the Federal Department of Education, expert in the area, might promulgate a uniform federal standard, thereby limiting state choice. 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa71406(a) (Supp. 2005); <em>Irving Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Tatro,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/883/index.html">468 U.

S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93845 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, Congress has made clear that the Act itself represents an exercise in \xe2\x80\x9ccooperative federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d See <em>ante</em> (opinion of the Court)<em>, </em>at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Respecting the States\xe2\x80\x99 right to decide this procedural matter here, where education is at issue, where expertise matters, and where costs are shared, is consistent with that cooperative approach. See <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs.</em> v.<em> Blumer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/473/index.html">534 U. S. 473</a>, 495 (2002) (when interpreting statutes \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to advance cooperative federalism[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 we have not been reluctant to leave a range of permissible choices to the States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Robbins, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/259/index.html">528 U. S. 259</a>, 275 (2000);<em> New State Ice Co.</em> v. <em>Liebmann,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/262/index.html">285 U. S. 262</a>, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  And judicial respect for such congressional determinations is important.  Indeed, in today\xe2\x80\x99s technologically and legally complex world, whether court decisions embody that kind of judicial respect may represent the true test of federalist principle.  See <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em> v. <em>Iowa Utilities Bd., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/366/index.html">525 U. S. 366</a>, 420 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maryland has no special state law or regulation setting forth a special IEP-related burden of persuasion standard.   But it does have rules of state administrative procedure and a body of state administrative law.  The state ALJ should determine how those rules, or other state law applies to this case. Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 511,7\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x933 (2003) (hearings under the Act conducted in accord with general state administrative law); 7 Ky. Admin. Regs., tit. 707, ch. 1:340, Section 7(4) (2004) (same).  Because the state ALJ did not do this (<em>i.e.</em>, he looked for a federal, not a state, burden of persuasion rule), I would remand this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
