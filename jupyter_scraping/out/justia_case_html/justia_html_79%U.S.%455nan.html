The assent of Congress did not make the act giving it a statute of the United States, in the sense of the 25th section of the Judiciary Act.  The construction of the act was in no way drawn in question, nor has any title or right been set up under it and denied by the state court.  It had no effect beyond giving the consent of Congress to the compact between the two states.</p>\n<p>The writ of error must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
