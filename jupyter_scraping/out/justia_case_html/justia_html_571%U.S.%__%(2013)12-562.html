To that end, they purchased from Deutsche Bank a series of currency-option spreads.  Each spread was a package consisting of a long option, which Woods and McCombs purchased from Deutsche Bank and for which they paid a premium, and a short option, which Woods and McCombs sold to Deutsche Bank and for which they received a premium.  Because the premium paid for the long option was largely offset by the premium received for the short option, the net cost of the package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost of the long option alone.  Woods and McCombs contributed the spreads, along with cash, to two partnerships, which used the cash to purchase stock and currency.  When calculating their basis in the partnership interests, Woods and McCombs considered only the long component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short component.  As a result, when the partnerships\xe2\x80\x99 assets were disposed of for modest gains, Woods and McCombs claimed huge losses.  Al-though they had contributed roughly $3.2 million in cash and spreads to the partnerships, they claimed losses of more than $45 million.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Internal Revenue Service sent each partnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, disregarding the partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses.  It concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax avoidance and thus lacked \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic substance,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., they were shams.  As there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their partnership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax underpayments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements.  Woods sought judicial review.  The District Court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply.

A determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is such an adjustment.  TEFRA authorizes courts in partnership-level proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership item, even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent, partner-level proceeding.  In that later proceeding, each partner may raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specifically.

Tax shelters of this type sought to generate large paper losses that a taxpayer could use to reduce taxable income.  They did so by attempting to give the tax-payer an artificially high basis in a partnership interest, which enabled the taxpayer to claim a significant tax loss upon disposition of the interest.  See IRS Notice 2000\xe2\x80\x9344, 2000\xe2\x80\x932 Cum. Bull. 255 (describing offsetting-option tax shelters).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe particular tax shelter at issue in this case was developed by the now-defunct law firm Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist and marketed by the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young under the name \xe2\x80\x9cCurrent Options Bring Reward Alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d or COBRA.  Respondent Gary Woods and his employer, Billy Joe McCombs, agreed to participate in COBRA to reduce their tax liability for 1999.  To that end, in November 1999 they created two general partnerships: one, Tesoro Drive Partners, to produce ordinary losses, and the other, SA Tesoro Investment Partners, to produce capital losses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOver the next two months, acting through their respective wholly owned, limited liability companies, Woods and McCombs executed a series of transactions.  First, they purchased from Deutsche Bank five 30-day currency-option spreads.  Each of these option spreads was a package consisting of a so-called long option, which entitled Woods and McCombs to receive a sum of money from Deutsche Bank if a certain currency exchange rate exceeded a certain figure on a certain date, and a so-called short option, which entitled Deutsche Bank to receive a sum of money from Woods and McCombs if the exchange rate for the same currency on the same date exceeded a certain figure so close to the figure triggering the long option that both were likely to be triggered (or not to be triggered) on the fated date.  Because the premium paid to Deutsche Bank for purchase of the long option was largely offset by the premium received from Deutsche Bank for sale of the short option, the net cost of the package to Woods and McCombs was substantially less than the cost of the long option alone.  Specifically, the premiums paid for all five of the spreads\xe2\x80\x99 long options totaled $46 million, and the premiums received for the five spreads\xe2\x80\x99 short options totaled $43.7 million, so the net cost of the spreads was just $2.3 million.  Woods and McCombs contributed the spreads to the partnerships along with about $900,000 in cash.  The partnerships used the cash to purchase assets\xe2\x80\x94Canadian dollars for the partnership that sought to produce ordinary losses, and Sun Microsystems stock for the partnership that sought to produce capital losses.  The partnerships then terminated the five option spreads in exchange for a lump-sum payment from Deutsche Bank.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the tax year drew to a close, Woods and McCombs transferred their interests in the partnerships to two S corporations.  One corporation, Tesoro Drive Investors, Inc., received both partners\xe2\x80\x99 interests in Tesoro Drive Partners; the other corporation, SA Tesoro Drive Investors, Inc., received both partners\xe2\x80\x99 interests in SA Tesoro Investment Partners.  Since this left each partnership with only a single partner (the relevant S corporation), the partnerships were liquidated by operation of law, and their assets\xe2\x80\x94the Canadian dollars and Sun Microsystems stock, plus the remaining cash\xe2\x80\x94were deemed distributed to the corporations.  The corporations then sold those assets for modest gains of about $2,000 on the Canadian dollars and about $57,000 on the stock.  But instead of gains, the corporations reported huge losses: an ordinary loss of more than $13 million on the sale of the Canadian dollars and a capital loss of more than $32 million on the sale of the stock.  The losses were allocated between Woods and McCombs as the corporations\xe2\x80\x99 co-owners.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reason the corporations were able to claim such vast losses\xe2\x80\x94the alchemy at the heart of an offsetting-options tax shelter\xe2\x80\x94lay in how Woods and McCombs calculated the tax basis of their interests in the partnerships.  Tax basis is the amount used as the cost of an asset when computing how much its owner gained or lost for tax purposes when disposing of it.  See J. Downes &amp; J. Goodman, Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 736 (2010).  A partner\xe2\x80\x99s tax basis in a partnership interest\xe2\x80\x94called \xe2\x80\x9coutside basis\xe2\x80\x9d to distinguish it from \xe2\x80\x9cinside basis,\xe2\x80\x9d the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s basis in its own assets\xe2\x80\x94is tied to the value of any assets the partner contributed to acquire the interest.  See \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7722.  Collectively, Woods and McCombs contributed roughly $3.2 million in option spreads and cash to acquire their interests in the two partnerships.  But for purposes of computing outside basis, Woods and McCombs considered only the long component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offset-ting short component on the theory that it was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo contingent\xe2\x80\x9d to count.  Brief for Respondent 14.  As a result, they claimed a total adjusted outside basis of more than $48 million.  Since the basis of property distributed to a partner by a liquidating partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the partner\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the partnership (reduced by any cash distributed with the property), see \xc2\xa7732(b), the inflated outside basis figure was carried over to the S corporations\xe2\x80\x99 basis in the Canadian dollars and the stock, enabling the corporations to report enormous losses when those assets were sold.  At the end of the day, Woods\xe2\x80\x99 and McCombs\xe2\x80\x99 $3.2 million investment generated tax losses that, if treated as valid, could have shielded more than $45 million of income from taxation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Internal Revenue Service, however, did not treat the COBRA-generated losses as valid.  Instead, after auditing the partnerships\xe2\x80\x99 tax returns, it issued to each partnership a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, or \xe2\x80\x9cFPAA.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the FPAAs, the IRS determined that the partnerships had been \xe2\x80\x9cformed and availed of solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the partnership interests of [the] purported partners.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 92, 146.  Because the partnerships had \xe2\x80\x9cno business purpose other than tax avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d the IRS said, they \xe2\x80\x9clacked economic substance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, put more starkly, they were \xe2\x80\x9csham[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so the IRS would disregard them for tax purposes and disallow the related losses.  Ibid.  And because there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes, the IRS determined that the partners had \xe2\x80\x9cnot established adjusted bases in their respective partnership interests in an amount greater than zero,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 95, \xc2\xb67, 149, \xc2\xb67 so that any resulting tax underpayments would be subject to a 40-percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements, see \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76662(b)(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWoods, as the tax-matters partner for both partnerships, sought judicial review of the FPAAs pursuant to \xc2\xa76226(a).  The District Court held that the partner- ships were properly disregarded as shams but that the valuation-misstatement penalty did not apply.  The Govern-ment appealed the decision on the penalty to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the Fifth Circuit held in a similar case that, under Circuit precedent, the valuation-misstatement penalty does not apply when the relevant transaction is disregarded for lacking economic substance.

A partnership does not pay federal income taxes; instead, its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701.  A partnership must report its tax items on an information return, \xc2\xa76031(a), and the partners must report their distributive shares of the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s tax items on their own individual returns, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7702, 704.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore 1982, the IRS had no way of correcting errors on a partnership\xe2\x80\x99s return in a single, unified proceeding.  Instead, tax matters pertaining to all the members of a partnership were dealt with just like tax matters pertaining only to a single taxpayer: through deficiency proceedings at the individual-taxpayer level.  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76211\xe2\x80\x936216 (2006 ed. and Supp. V).  Deficiency proceedings require the IRS to issue a separate notice of deficiency to each taxpayer, \xc2\xa76212(a) (2006 ed.), who can file a petition in the Tax Court disputing the alleged deficiency before paying it, \xc2\xa76213(a).  Having to use deficiency proceedings for partnership-related tax matters led to du-plicative proceedings and the potential for inconsistent treatment of partners in the same partnership.  Congress addressed those difficulties by enacting the Tax Treatment of Partnership Items Act of 1982, as Title IV of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA).  \n\n96Stat.\n648 (codified as amended at 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76221\xe2\x80\x936232 (2006 ed. and Supp. V)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder TEFRA, partnership-related tax matters are addressed in two stages.  First, the IRS must initiate proceedings at the partnership level to adjust \xe2\x80\x9cpartnership items,\xe2\x80\x9d those relevant to the partnership as a whole.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76221, 6231(a)(3).  It must issue an FPAA notifying the partners of any adjustments to partnership items, \xc2\xa76223(a)(2), and the partners may seek judicial review of those adjustments, \xc2\xa76226(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Once the adjustments to partnership items have become final, the IRS may undertake further proceedings at the partner level to make any resulting \xe2\x80\x9ccomputational adjustments\xe2\x80\x9d in the tax liability of the individual partners.  \xc2\xa76231(a)(6).  Most computational adjustments may be directly assessed against the partners, bypassing deficiency proceedings and permitting the partners to challenge the assessments only in post-payment refund actions.  \xc2\xa76230(a)(1), (c).  Deficiency proceedings are still required, however, for certain com-putational adjustments that are attributable to \xe2\x80\x9caffected items,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, items that are affected by (but are not themselves) partnership items.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76230(a)(2)(A)(i), 6231(a)(5).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the TEFRA framework, a court in a partnership-level proceeding like this one has jurisdiction to determine not just partnership items, but also \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicability of any penalty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76226(f).  As both sides agree, a determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is an adjustment to a partnership item.  Thus, the jurisdictional question here boils down to whether the valuation-misstatement penalty \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d the determination that the partnerships Woods and McCombs created were shams.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory of why the penalty was triggered is based on a straightforward relationship between the economic-substance determination and the penalty.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, there can be no outside basis in a sham partnership (which, for tax purposes, does not exist), so any partner who underpaid his individual taxes by declaring an outside basis greater than zero committed a valuation misstatement.  In other words, the penalty flows logically and inevitably from the economic-substance determination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWoods, however, argues that because outside basis is not a partnership item, but an affected item, a penalty that would rest on a misstatement of outside basis cannot be considered at the partnership level.  He maintains, in short, that a penalty does not relate to a partnership-item adjustment if it \xe2\x80\x9crequires a partner-level determination,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not the penalty has a connection to a partnership item.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 27.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause \xc2\xa76226(f)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d language is \xe2\x80\x9cessentially indeterminate,\xe2\x80\x9d we must resolve this dispute by looking to \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure of [TEFRA] and its other provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  That inquiry makes clear that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction is not as narrow as Woods contends.  Prohibiting courts in partnership-level proceedings from considering the applicability of penalties that require partner-level inquiries would be inconsistent with the nature of the \xe2\x80\x9capplicability\xe2\x80\x9d determination that TEFRA requires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder TEFRA\xe2\x80\x99s two-stage structure, penalties for tax underpayment must be imposed at the partner level, because partnerships themselves pay no taxes.  And imposing a penalty always requires some determinations that can be made only at the partner level.  Even where a partnership\xe2\x80\x99s return contains significant errors, a partner may not have carried over those errors to his own return; or if he did, the errors may not have caused him to underpay his taxes by a large enough amount to trigger the penalty; or if they did, the partner may nonetheless have acted in good faith with reasonable cause, which is a bar to the imposition of many penalties, see \xc2\xa76664(c)(1).  None of those issues can be conclusively determined at the partnership level.  Yet notwithstanding that every pen-alty must be imposed in partner-level proceedings after partner-level determinations, TEFRA provides that the applicability of some penalties must be determined at the partnership level.  The applicability determination is therefore inherently provisional; it is always contingent upon determinations that the court in a partnership-level proceeding does not have jurisdiction to make.  Barring partnership-level courts from considering the applicability of penalties that cannot be imposed without partner-level inquiries would render TEFRA\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to consider some penalties at the partnership level meaningless.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther provisions of TEFRA confirm that conclusion.  One requires the IRS to use deficiency proceedings for computational adjustments that rest on \xe2\x80\x9caffected items which require partner level determinations (other than penalties .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that relate to adjustments to partnership items).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76230(a)(2)(A)(i).  Another states that while a partnership-level determination \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning the applicability of any penalty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d in a subsequent re-fund action, that does not prevent the partner from \xe2\x80\x9cassert[ing] any partner level defenses that may apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76230(c)(4).  Both these provisions assume that a penalty can relate to a partnership-item adjustment even if the penalty cannot be imposed without additional, partner-level determinations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese considerations lead us to reject Woods\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa76226(f).  We hold that TEFRA gives courts in partnership-level proceedings jurisdiction to determine the applicability of any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership item, even if imposing the penalty would also require determining affected or non-partnership items such as outside basis.  The partnership-level applicability determination, we stress, is provisional: the court may decide only whether adjustments properly made at the partnership level have the potential to trigger the penalty.  Each partner remains free to raise, in subsequent, partner-level proceedings, any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specifically.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying the foregoing principles to this case, we conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement penalty\xe2\x80\x94to determine, that is, whether the partnerships\xe2\x80\x99 lack of economic substance (which all agree was properly decided at the partnership level) could justify imposing a valuation-misstatement penalty on the partners.  When making that determination, the District Court was obliged to consider Woods\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that the economic-substance determination was categorically incapable of triggering the penalty.  Deferring consideration of those arguments until partner-level proceedings would replicate the precise evil that TEFRA sets out to remedy: duplicative proceedings, potentially leading to inconsistent results, on a question that applies equally to all of the partners.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, the District Court could not make a formal ad-justment of any partner\xe2\x80\x99s outside basis in this partnership-level proceeding.  See Petaluma, 591 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 655.  But it nonetheless could determine whether the adjustments it did make, including the economic-substance deter-mination, had the potential to trigger a penalty; and in doing so, it was not required to shut its eyes to the legal impossibility of any partner\xe2\x80\x99s possessing an outside basis greater than zero in a partnership that, for tax purposes, did not exist.  Each partner\xe2\x80\x99s outside basis still must be adjusted at the partner level before the penalty can be imposed, but that poses no obstacle to a partnership-level court\xe2\x80\x99s provisional consideration of whether the economic-substance determination is legally capable of triggering the penalty.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII.

But even if \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d were limited to factual matters, the statute refers to \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted basis,\xe2\x80\x9d and there is no justification for extending that limitation to the latter term, which plainly incorporates legal inquiries.

The statute contains no indication that the misapplication of one of those legal rules cannot trigger the penalty.  Were we to hold otherwise, we would read the word \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo overcome the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted basis,\xe2\x80\x9d Woods asks us to interpret the parentheses in the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of any property (or the adjusted basis of any property)\xe2\x80\x9d as a signal that \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted basis\xe2\x80\x9d is merely explanatory or illustrative and has no meaning inde-pendent of \xe2\x80\x9cvalue.\xe2\x80\x9d  The parentheses cannot bear that much weight, given the compelling textual evidence to the contrary.  For one thing, the terms reappear later in the same sentence sans parentheses\xe2\x80\x94in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csuch valuation or adjusted basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, the operative terms are connected by the conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cor.\xe2\x80\x9d  While that can sometimes introduce an appositive\xe2\x80\x94a word or phrase that is synonymous with what precedes it (\xe2\x80\x9cVienna or Wien,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBatman or the Caped Crusader\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94its ordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to \xe2\x80\x9cbe given separate meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reiter v.

And the fact that both penalties are potentially applicable to sham transactions resulting in valuation misstatements is not problematic.  Congress recognized that penalties might overlap in a given case, and it addressed that possibility by providing that a taxpayer generally cannot receive more than one accuracy-related penalty for the same underpayment.

This is not a case where a valuation misstatement is a mere side effect of a sham transaction.  Rather, the overstatement of outside basis was the linchpin of the COBRA tax shelter and the mechanism by which Woods and McCombs sought to reduce their taxable income.  As Judge Prado observed, in this type of tax shelter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe basis misstatement and the transaction\xe2\x80\x99s lack of economic substance are inextricably intertwined,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cattributing the tax underpayment only to the artificiality of the transaction and not to the basis overvaluation is making a false distinction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bemont, supra, at 354 (concurring opinion).  In short, the partners underpaid their taxes because they overstated their outside basis, and they overstated their outside basis because the partnerships were shams.

Of course the Blue Book, like a law review article, may be relevant to the extent it is persuasive.  But the passage at issue here does not persuade.  It concerns a situation quite different from the one we confront: two separate, non-overlapping underpayments, only one of which is attributable to a valuation misstatement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court had jurisdiction in this partnership-level proceeding to determine the applicability of the valuation-misstatement penalty, and the penalty is applicable to tax underpayments resulting from the partners\xe2\x80\x99 participation in the COBRA tax shelter.

We need not resolve that question today, but we do not think amici\xe2\x80\x99s answer necessarily follows.
