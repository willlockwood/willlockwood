Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1) The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s injury-in-fact analysis elided the independent \xe2\x80\x9cconcreteness\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  Both observations it made concerned only \xe2\x80\x9cparticularization,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>the requirement that an injury \xe2\x80\x9caffect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Lujan</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 560, n.\xc2\xa01, but an injury in fact must be both concrete <i>and</i> particularized, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Susan B. Anthony List </i>v.<i> Driehaus</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Concreteness is quite different from particularization and requires an injury to be \xe2\x80\x9c<i>de facto</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, to actually exist.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2) The Ninth Circuit also failed to address whether the alleged procedural violations entail a degree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.  A \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete\xe2\x80\x9d injury need not be a \xe2\x80\x9ctangible\xe2\x80\x9d injury.  See, <i>e.g., Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460\n.  To determine whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress are instructive.  Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, but a plaintiff does not automatically satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a right and purports to authorize a suit to vindicate it.  Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.  This does not mean, however, that the risk of real harm cannot satisfy that requirement.  See<i>, e.g.,</i> <i>Clapper </i>v. <i>Amnesty Int\xe2\x80\x99l USA</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ____.  The violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact; in such a case, a plaintiff need not allege any <i>additional</i> harm beyond the one identified by Congress, see <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Akins</i>,\n\n524 U. S. 11\n\xe2\x80\x9325.  This Court takes no position on the correctness of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion, but these general principles demonstrate two things: that Congress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk and that Robins cannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation.

The Ninth Circuit noted, first, that Robins had alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cSpokeo violated <i>his</i> statutory rights, not just the statu-tory rights of other people,\xe2\x80\x9d and, second, that \xe2\x80\x9cRobins\xe2\x80\x99s personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.\xe2\x80\x9d  742 F.\xc2\xa03d 409, 413 (2014).

By some means not detailed in Robins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, he became aware of the contents of that profile and discovered that it contained inaccurate information.  His profile, he asserts, states that he is married, has children, is in his 50\xe2\x80\x99s, has a job, is relatively affluent, and holds a graduate degree.  App. 14.  According to Robins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, all of this information is incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Robins filed a class-action complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming, among other things, that Spokeo willfully failed to comply with the FCRA requirements enumerated above.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court initially denied Spokeo\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, but later reconsidered and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.

Relying on Circuit precedent,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] the court began by stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation of a statutory right is usually a sufficient injury in fact to confer standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  742 F. 3d, at 412.  The court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution limits the power of Congress to confer standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 413.  But the court held that those limits were honored in this case because Robins alleged that \xe2\x80\x9cSpokeo violated <i>his </i>statutory rights, not just the statutory rights of other people,\xe2\x80\x9d and because his \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis in original).  The court thus concluded that Robins\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9calleged violations of [his] statutory rights [were] sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 413\xe2\x80\x93414.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari.  575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Constitution confers limited authority on each branch of the Federal Government.

An injury in fact must also be \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, that independent requirement was elided.  As previously noted, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Robins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleges \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete, <i>de facto</i>\xe2\x80\x9d injuries for essentially two reasons.  742 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 413.  First, the court noted that Robins \xe2\x80\x9calleges that Spokeo violated <i>his </i>statutory rights, not just the statutory rights of other people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Second, the court wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cRobins\xe2\x80\x99s personal interests in the handling of his credit information are <i>individualized rather than collective</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis added).  Both of these observations concern particularization, not concreteness.  We have made it clear time and time again that an injury in fact must be both concrete <i>and</i> particularized.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Susan B. Anthony List </i>v.<i> Driehaus</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8); <i>Summers</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 493; <i>Sprint Communications Co.</i> v. <i>APCC Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 269,\n274 (2008)\n; <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>EPA</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497,\n517 (2007)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete\xe2\x80\x9d injury must be \xe2\x80\x9c<i>de facto</i>\xe2\x80\x9d; that is, it must actually exist.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009).  When we have used the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete,\xe2\x80\x9d we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9creal,\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cabstract.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 472 (1971); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 305 (1967).  Concreteness, therefore, is quite different from particularization.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cConcrete\xe2\x80\x9d is not, however, necessarily synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9ctangible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, we have confirmed in many of our previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pleasant Grove City</i> v. <i>Summum</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460 (2009)\n (free speech); <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520 (1993)\n (free exercise).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In determining whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress play important roles.  Because the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy requirement, and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.  See <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765\n\xe2\x80\x93777 (2000).  In addition, because Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, its judgment is also instructive and important.  Thus, we said in <i>Lujan </i>that Congress may \xe2\x80\x9celevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, <i>de\xc2\xa0facto </i>injuries that were previously inadequate in law.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 578.  Similarly, Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in that case explained that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Id.,</i> at 580 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.  Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.  For that reason, Robins could not, for example, allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.  See <i>Summers</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 496 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is insufficient to create Article III standing\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Lujan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 572.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This does not mean, however, that the risk of real harm cannot satisfy the requirement of concreteness.  See<i>, e.g.,</i> <i>Clapper </i>v. <i>Amnesty Int\xe2\x80\x99l USA</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ____.  For example, the law has long permitted recovery by certain tort victims even if their harms may be difficult to prove or measure.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Restatement (First) of Torts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7569 (libel), 570 (slander <i>per se</i>) (1938).  Just as the common law permitted suit in such instances, the violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact.  In other words, a plaintiff in such a case need not allege any <i>additional</i> harm beyond the one Congress has identified.  See <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </i>v. <i>Akins</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 11\n\xe2\x80\x9325 (1998) (confirming that a group of voters\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinability to obtain information\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress had decided to make public is a sufficient injury in fact to satisfy Article III); <i>Public Citizen</i> v. <i>Department of Justice</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440,\n449 (1989)\n (holding that two advocacy organizations\xe2\x80\x99 failure to obtain information subject to disclosure under the Federal Advisory Committee Act \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the context of this particular case, these general principles tell us two things: On the one hand, Congress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk.  On the other hand, Robins cannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation.  A violation of one of the FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s procedural requirements may result in no harm.  For example, even if a consumer reporting agency fails to provide the required notice to a user of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s consumer information, that information regardless may be entirely accurate.  In addition, not all inaccuracies cause harm or present any material risk of harm.  An example that comes readily to mind is an incorrect zip code.  It is difficult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because the Ninth Circuit failed to fully appreciate the distinction between concreteness and particularization, its standing analysis was incomplete.  It did not address the question framed by our discussion, namely, whether the particular procedural violations alleged in this case entail a degree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.  We take no position as to whether the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that Robins adequately alleged an injury in fact\xe2\x80\x94was correct.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Act defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer report\xe2\x80\x9d as:\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98consumer reporting agency\xe2\x80\x99 means any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681a(f\xc2\xa0).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0This statutory provision uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer,\xe2\x80\x9d but that term is defined to mean \xe2\x80\x9can individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681a(c).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">4</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0For purposes of this opinion, we assume that Spokeo is a consumer reporting agency.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See <i>Edwards </i>v.<i> First American Corp</i>., 610 F.\xc2\xa03d 514 (CA9 2010), cert. granted <i>sub nom.</i> <i>First American Financial Corp. </i>v.<i> Edwards</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1018 (2011)\n, cert. dism\xe2\x80\x99d as improvidently granted, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThat a suit may be a class action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class \xe2\x80\x98must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky.

I write separately to explain how, in my view, the injury-in-fact requirement applies to different types of rights.  The judicial power of common-law courts was historically limited depending on the nature of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  Common-law courts more readily entertained suits from private plaintiffs who alleged a violation of their own rights, in contrast to private plaintiffs who asserted claims vindicating public rights.  Those limitations persist in modern standing doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Standing doctrine limits the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources </i>v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens</i>,\n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n774 (2000)\n (quoting <i>Steel Co. </i>v. <i>Citizens for a Better Environ</i>ment,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n102 (1998)\n).  To understand the limits that standing imposes on \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial Power,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, we must \xe2\x80\x9crefer directly to the traditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of common-law courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Honig </i>v. <i>Doe</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305,\n340 (1988)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  These limitations preserve separationof powers by preventing the judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s entanglement in disputes that are primarily political in nature.  This concern is generally absent when a private plaintiff seeks to enforce only his personal rights against another private party.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Common-law courts imposed different limitations on a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to bring suit depending on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate.  Historically,common-law courts possessed broad power to adjudicate suits involving the alleged violation of private rights, even when plaintiffs alleged only the violation of those rights and nothing more.  \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d are rights \xe2\x80\x9cbelonging to individuals, considered as individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *2 (hereinafter Blackstone).  \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d have traditionally included rights of personal security (including security of reputation), property rights, and contract rights.  See 1 <i>id.</i>, at *130\xe2\x80\x93*139; Woolhander &amp; Nelson, Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine?, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 693 (2004).  In a suit for the violation of a private right, courts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a <i>de facto</i> injury merely from having his personal, legal rights invaded.  Thus, when one man placed his foot on another\xe2\x80\x99s property, the property owner needed to show nothing more to establish a traditional case or controversy.  See <i>Entick</i> v. <i>Carrington,</i> 2 Wils. K.\xc2\xa0B. 275, 291, 95 Eng. Rep. 807, 817 (1765).  Many traditional remedies for private-rights causes of action\xe2\x80\x94such as for trespass, infringement of intellectual property, and unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x94are not contingent on a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegation of damages beyond the violation of his private legal right.  See Brief for Restitution and Remedies Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6\xe2\x80\x9318; see also <i>Webb</i> v. <i>Portland Mfg. Co.,</i> 29 F. Cas. 506, 508 (No. 17,322) (Me. 1838) (stating that a legal injury \xe2\x80\x9cimports damage in the nature of it\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Common-law courts, however, have required a further showing of injury for violations of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rights that involve duties owed \xe2\x80\x9cto the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Blackstone *5.  Such rights include \xe2\x80\x9cfree navigation of waterways, passage on public highways, and general compliance with regulatory law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Woolhander &amp; Nelson, 102 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 693.  Generally, only the government had the authority to vindicate a harm borne by the public at large, such as the violation of the criminal laws.  See <i>id.,</i> at 695\xe2\x80\x93700.  Even in limited cases where private plaintiffs could bring a claim for the violation of public rights, they had to allege that the violation caused them \xe2\x80\x9csome extraordinary damage, beyond the rest of the [community].\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Blackstone<i> </i>*220 (discussing nuisance); see also <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Webb</i>, 27 Va. 726, 729 (Gen. Ct. 1828).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  An action to redress a public nuisance, for example, was historically considered an action to vindicate the violation of a public right at common law, lest \xe2\x80\x9cevery subject in the kingdom\xe2\x80\x9d be able to \xe2\x80\x9charass the offender with separate actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Blackstone *219; see also 4 <i>id.,</i> at *167 (same).  But if the plaintiff could allege \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damage\xe2\x80\x9d as the result of a nuisance, the suit could proceed.  The existence of special, individualized damage had the effect of creating a private action for compensatory relief to an otherwise public-rights claim.  See 3 <i>id.,</i> at *220.  Similarly, a plaintiff had to allege individual damage in disputes over the use of public lands.  <i>E.g.</i>, <i>Robert Marys\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 9 Co. Rep. 111b, 112b, 77 Eng. Rep. 895, 898\xe2\x80\x93899 (K. B. 1613) (commoner must establish not only <i>injuria</i> [legal injury] but also <i>damnum</i> [damage] to challenge another\xe2\x80\x99s overgrazing on the commons).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">These differences between legal claims brought by private plaintiffs for the violation of public and private rights underlie modern standing doctrine and explain the Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the injury-in-fact requirement.  \xe2\x80\x9cInjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d is the first of three \xe2\x80\x9cirreducible\xe2\x80\x9d requirements for Article III standing.  <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555,\n560 (1992)\n.  The injury-in-fact requirement often stymies a private plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to vindicate the infringement of <i>public </i>rights.  The Court has said time and again that, when a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a public right, the plaintiff must allege that he has suffered a \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete\xe2\x80\x9d injury particular to himself.  See <i>Schlesinger </i>v. <i>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 208\n\xe2\x80\x93223 (1974) (explaining this where plaintiffs sought to enforce the Incompatibility Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa76, cl.\xc2\xa02, against Members of Congress holding reserve commissions in the Armed Forces); see also <i>Lujan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 572\xe2\x80\x93573 (evaluating standing where plaintiffs sought to enforce the Endangered Species Act); <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167\n\xe2\x80\x93184 (2000) (Clean Water Act).  This requirement applies with special force when a plaintiff files suit to require an executive agency to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow the law\xe2\x80\x9d; at that point, the citizen must prove that he \xe2\x80\x9chas sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of that [challenged] action and it is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Levitt</i>,\n\n302 U.\xc2\xa0S. 633,\n634 (1937)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  Thus, in a case where private plaintiffs sought to compel the U.\xc2\xa0S. Forest Service to follow certain procedures when it regulated \xe2\x80\x9csmall fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that \xe2\x80\x9cdeprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is insufficient to create Article III standing,\xe2\x80\x9d even if \xe2\x80\x9caccorded by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Summers</i> v. <i>Earth Island Institute</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 488\n\xe2\x80\x93497 (2009).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the concrete-harm requirement does not apply as rigorously when a private plaintiff seeks to vindicate his own private rights.  Our contemporary decisions have not required a plaintiff to assert an actual injury beyond the violation of his personal legal rights to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury-in-fact\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See, <i>e.g., Carey </i>v. <i>Piphus</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247,\n266 (1978)\n (holding that nominal damages are appropriate when a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights have been infringed but he cannot show further injury).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The separation-of-powers concerns underlying our public-rights decisions are not implicated when private indi-viduals sue to redress violations of their own private rights.  But, when they are implicated, standing doctrine keeps courts out of political disputes by denying private litigants the right to test the abstract legality of government action.  See <i>Schlesinger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 222.  And by limiting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to delegate law enforcement authority to private plaintiffs and the courts, standing doctrine preserves executive discretion.  See <i>Lujan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 577 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98To permit Congress to convert the undifferenti-ated public interest in executive officers\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with the law into an \xe2\x80\x98individual right\xe2\x80\x99 vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the President to the courts the Chief Executive\xe2\x80\x99s most important constitutional duty, to \xe2\x80\x98take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  But where one private party has alleged that another private party violated his private rights, there is generally no danger that the private party\xe2\x80\x99s suit is an impermissible attempt to police the activity of the political branches or, more broadly, that the legislative branch has impermissibly delegated law enforcement authority from the executive to a private individual.  See Hessick, Standing, Injury in Fact, and Private Rights, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 275, 317\xe2\x80\x93321 (2008).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When Congress creates new private causes of action to vindicate private or public rights, these Article III principles circumscribe federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 power to adjudicate a suit alleging the violation of those new legal rights.  Congress can create new private rights and authorize private plaintiffs to sue based simply on the violation of those private rights.  See <i>Warth </i>v. <i>Seldin</i>,\n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490,\n500 (1975)\n.  A plaintiff seeking to vindicate a statutorily created private right need not allege actual harm beyond the invasion of that private right.  See <i>Havens Realty Corp. </i>v. <i>Coleman</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 363\n\xe2\x80\x93374 (1982) (recognizing standing for a violation of the Fair Housing Act); <i>Tennessee Elec. Power Co.</i> v. <i>TVA</i>,\n\n306 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118\n\xe2\x80\x93138 (1939) (recognizing that standing can exist where \xe2\x80\x9cthe right invaded is a legal right,\xe2\x80\x94one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a privilege\xe2\x80\x9d).  A plaintiff seeking to vindicate a public right embodied in a federal statute, however, must demonstrate that the violation of that public right has caused him a concrete, individual harm distinct from the general population.  See <i>Lujan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 578 (noting that, whatever the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to create new legal rights, \xe2\x80\x9cit is clear that in suits against the Government, at least, the concrete injury requirement must remain\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, Congress cannot authorize private plaintiffs to enforce <i>public</i> rights in their own names, absent some showing that the plaintiff has suffered a concrete harm particular to him.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Given these principles, I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to vacate and remand.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act creates a series of regulatory duties.  Robins has no standing to sue Spokeo, in his own name, for violations of the duties that Spokeo owes to the public collectively, absent some showing that he has suffered concrete and particular harm.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  These consumer protection requirements include, for example, the requirement to \xe2\x80\x9cpost a toll-free telephone number on [Spokeo\xe2\x80\x99s] website through which consumers can request free annual file disclosures.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 23, First Amended Complaint \xc2\xb674; see\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681j; 16 CFR \xc2\xa7610.3(a)(1) (2010).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But a remand is required because one claim in Robins\xe2\x80\x99 complaint rests on a statutory provision that could argu-ably establish a private cause of action to vindicate the violation of a privately held right.  Section 1681e(b) requires Robins to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information <i>concerning the individual about whom the report relates.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71681e(b) (emphasis added).  If Congress has created a private duty owed personally to Robins to protect <i>his </i>information, then the violation of the legal duty suffices for Article III injury in fact.  If that provision, however, vests any and all consumers with the power to police the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable procedures\xe2\x80\x9d of Spokeo, without more, then Robins has no standing to sue for its violation absent an allegation that he has suffered individualized harm.  On remand, the Court of Appeals can consider the nature of this claim.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The well-established exception for <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam</i> actions allows private plaintiffs to sue in the government\xe2\x80\x99s name for the violation of a public right.

Judged by what we have said about \xe2\x80\x9cconcreteness,\xe2\x80\x9d Robins\xe2\x80\x99 allegations carry him across the threshold.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion observes that time and again, our decisions have coupled the words \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete <i>and</i> particularized.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8 (citing as examples, <i>Susan B.

See, <i>e.g., Lujan</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (a plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cseeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large does not state an Article III case or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d (punctuation omitted)); <i>Perkins</i> v. <i>Lukens Steel Co.</i>,\n\n310 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113,\n125 (1940)\n (plaintiffs lack standing because they failed to show injury to \xe2\x80\x9ca particular right of their own, as distinguished from the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the administration of the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Robins\xe2\x80\x99 claim does not present a question of that character.
