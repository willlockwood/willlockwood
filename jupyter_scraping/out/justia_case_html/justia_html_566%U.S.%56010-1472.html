As originally configured, \xc2\xa71920 contained five categories of taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which added a sixth category that includes \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71920(6).

Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 179\n.  When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d as one who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.  Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of oral translation.  Respondent relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary that defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cone that translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one \xe2\x80\x9cwho translates orally,\xe2\x80\x9d that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition \xe2\x80\x9cone that translates.\xe2\x80\x9d  That a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.  See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296\n.  Although all relevant dictionaries defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials.  Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative, recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d can mean one who translates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.  Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.  Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d does not include those who translate writings.  Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in \xc2\xa71920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning.  If anything, the statutory context suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d includes only those who translate orally.  See \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71827.  Moreover, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of technical terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and translators, who are used for written communications.

To the contrary, the Court has made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade\xe2\x80\x9d the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Crawford Fitting, supra, at 442, but \xe2\x80\x9cis solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in \xc2\xa71920,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are limited by statute and modest in scope.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s extratextual arguments\xe2\x80\x95that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written\xe2\x80\x95are more properly directed at Congress.  In any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71920(6).

The question pre- sented in this case is whether \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters\xe2\x80\x9d covers the cost of translating documents.  Because the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d is a person who translates orally from one language to another, we hold that \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters\xe2\x80\x9d is limited to the cost of oral translation and does not include the cost of document translation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case arises from a personal injury action brought by petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball player in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Islands.  Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through a wooden deck during a tour of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s resort prop- erty.  Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical attention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent that he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments from the accident.  Due to these alleged injuries, he claimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income from contracts he was unable to honor.  After discovery concluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.  The United States District Court for the Northern Ma- riana Islands granted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion on the ground that petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew of the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise reasonable care.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn preparing its defense, respondent paid to have various documents translated from Japanese to English.  After the District Court granted summary judgment in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.  Over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the District Court awarded the costs to respondent as \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71920(6).  Explaining that interpreter services \xe2\x80\x9ccan- not be separated into \xe2\x80\x98translation\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98interpretation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs for document translation \xe2\x80\x9cfal[l] within the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98compensation of an interpreter,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  Finding that it was necessary for respondent to have the documents translated in order to depose petitioner, the court con- cluded that the translation services were properly taxed as costs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed both the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment and its award of costs.  The court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the cost of document translation services is not recoverable as \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe word \xe2\x80\x98interpreter\xe2\x80\x99 can reasonably encompass a \xe2\x80\x98translator,\xe2\x80\x99 both according to the dictionary definition and common usage of these terms, which does not always draw precise distinctions between foreign language interpretations involving live speech versus written documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  633 F.\xc2\xa03d 1218, 1221 (2011).  \xe2\x80\x9cMore importantly,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stressed, this construction of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cis more compatible with Rule 54 of the Fed- eral Rules of Civil Procedure, which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The court thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing party should be awarded costs for services required to interpret either live speech or written documents into a familiar language, so long as interpretation of the items is necessary to the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1221\xe2\x80\x931222.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on this issue,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t we granted certiorari.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the taxation of costs was not allowed at common law, it was the practice of federal courts in the early years to award costs in the same manner as the courts of the relevant forum State.

The then-current edition of Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, for example, defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person sworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the court,\xe2\x80\x9d and it defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d in relevant part as \xe2\x80\x9cto translate orally from one tongue to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also W.

For respondent, the general definition suf- fices to establish that the term \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily includes persons who translate the written word.  Explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe word \xe2\x80\x98interpreter\xe2\x80\x99 can reasonably encompass a \xe2\x80\x98translator,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion.  633 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1221.

See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, \n301 (1989)\n (relying on the \xe2\x80\x9cmost common meaning\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary and natural signification\xe2\x80\x9d of the word \xe2\x80\x9crequest,\xe2\x80\x9d even though it may sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cdouble for \xe2\x80\x98demand\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98command\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  The fact that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d in Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third has a sense divider denoting the most common usage suggests that other usages, although acceptable, might not be common or ordinary.  It is telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment as including persons who translate orally, but only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written material.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  Although the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative on the English language, recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d can mean one who translates writings, it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.  See supra, at 6.  Were the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d that respondent advocates truly common or ordinary, we would expect to see more support for that meaning.  We certainly would not expect to see it designated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.  Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBased on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we conclude that the ordinary or common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d does not include those who translate writings.  Instead, we find that an interpreter is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to another.  This sense of the word is far more natural.  As the Seventh Circuit put it: \xe2\x80\x9cRobert Fagles made famous translations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-language \xe2\x80\x98interpreter\xe2\x80\x99 of these works.\xe2\x80\x9d  Extra Equipamentos E Exporta\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o Ltda. v.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in \xc2\xa71920, however, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d and to embrace the broadest possible meaning that the definition of the word can bear.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:  that the word \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d applies only to those who translate orally.  As previously mentioned, Congress en- acted \xc2\xa71920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act. The main provision of that Act is \xc2\xa72(a), codified in 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71827 and 1828.  See \n\n92Stat.\n2040\xe2\x80\x932042.  Particularly relevant here is \xc2\xa71827.  As it now reads, that statute provides for the establishment of \xe2\x80\x9ca program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71827(a).  Subsection (d) directs courts to use an interpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the United States if a party or witness \xe2\x80\x9cspeaks only or primarily a language other than the English language\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csuffers from a hearing impairment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cso as to inhibit such party\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension of the proceedings or communication with counsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit such witness\xe2\x80\x99 comprehension of questions and the presentation of such testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71827(d)(1).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As originally enacted, subsection (k) mandated that the \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation provided by certified interpreters .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be in the consecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may authorize a simultaneous or summary interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also \n\n92Stat.\n2042.  In its current form, subsection (k) provides that interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cshall be in the simultaneous mode for any party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and in the consecutive mode for witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d unless the court directs otherwise.  The simultaneous, consecutive, and summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation and have nothing to do with the translation of writings.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Taken together, these provisions are a strong contextual clue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation in the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to use the term \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the Act in its ordinary sense as someone who translates the spoken word.  As we have said before, it is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98normal rule of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Gustafson v.

But we have never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statutory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in \xc2\xa71920.  To the contrary, we have made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power to evade\xe2\x80\x9d the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress.  Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442.  \xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d we have said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in \xc2\xa71920.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Rule 54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the ordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in the costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of taxable costs.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough \xe2\x80\x98costs\xe2\x80\x99 has an everyday meaning synonymous with \xe2\x80\x98expenses,\xe2\x80\x99 the concept of taxable costs under Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those expenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court will assess against a litigant.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa72666, pp. 202\xe2\x80\x93203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).  Taxable costs are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses as is evident from \xc2\xa71920, which lists such items as clerk fees, court reporter fees, expenses for printing and witnesses, expenses for exemplification and copies, docket fees, and compensation of court-appointed experts.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe assessment of costs most often is merely a clerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hairline Creations, Inc. v. Kefalas, 664 F.\xc2\xa02d 652, 656 (CA7 1981).  Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators.  It comes as little surprise, therefore, that \xe2\x80\x9ccosts almost always amount to less than the successful litigant\xe2\x80\x99s total expenses in connection with a lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa72666, at 203.  Because taxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in scope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary meaning of the cost items Congress authorized in \xc2\xa71920.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s extratextual arguments, they are more properly directed at Congress.  Respondent contends that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to require the losing party to cover translation costs for spoken words but not for written words.  Brief for Respondent 20.  Respondent also observes that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written.  Id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9324.  One task, called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sight translation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d involves the oral translation of a document.  Id., at 21.  Another task involves the written translation of speech.  Ibid.  And a third task, called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98document comparison,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d involves comparing documents in the source and target language to verify that the two are identical.  Id., at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Respondent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for these variations and that a bright-line definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d as someone who translates spoken and written words would avoid complication and provide a simple, administrable rule for district courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeither of these arguments convinces us that Congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71920(6).  First, Congress might have distinguished between oral and written translation out of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear the potentially sizable costs of translating discovery docu- ments, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral tes- timony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair, especially for litigants with limited means.  Cf. Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., \n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714, \n718 (1967)\n (noting the argument \xe2\x80\x9cthat since litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress might also have concluded that a document translator is more akin to an expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher documentary evidence\xe2\x80\x94like, for instance, a forensic accountant\xe2\x80\x94than to an interpreter whose real-time oral translation services are necessary for communication between litigants, witnesses, and the court.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, respondent has not shown that any of the hybrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points actually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the problem of drawing the line between taxable and nontax- able costs in such cases will vex the trial courts.  It certainly has not shown that any such problems will be more troublesome than the task of sifting through translated discovery documents to ascertain which can be taxed as necessary to the litigation.  In any event, the present case does not present a hybrid situation; it involves purely written translation, which falls outside the tasks performed by an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is ordinarily understood.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d is someone who translates orally from one language to another, we hold that the category \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation of interpreters\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71920(6) does not include costs for document translation.

See, e.g., Raffold Process Corp. v. Castanea Paper Co., 25 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 593, 594 (WD Pa. 1938).  Before the Court Interpreters Act added \xc2\xa71920(6) to the taxation of costs statute in 1978, district courts awarded costs for document translation under \xc2\xa71920(4), which allowed taxation of \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n28 U.

D. 200, 204 (SDNY 1959) (\xc2\xa71920(4)); Raffold Process Corp., 25 F. Supp., at 594 (\xc2\xa7830).  Pre-1978, district courts also awarded costs for oral translation of witness testimony.  See, e.g., Kaiser Industries Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp., 50 F. R. D. 5, 11 (ED Mich. 1970).  Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act, a measure intended to expand access to interpretation services, indicates a design to eliminate the availability of costs awards for document translation.  See S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93569, p. 4 (1977) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe committee\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. feels the time has come to provide by statute for the provision of and access to qualified certified interpreters, for a broader spectrum of people than the present law allows.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Post-1978, rulings awarding document translation costs under \xc2\xa71920(6) indicate the courts\xe2\x80\x99 understanding both that the term \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreter\xe2\x80\x9d can readily encompass oral and written translation, and that Congress did not otherwise instruct.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  I agree that context should guide the determination whether \xc2\xa71920(b) is most sensibly read to encompass persons who translate documents.  See ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But the context key for me is the practice of federal courts both before and after \xc2\xa71920(6)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe purpose of translation, after all, is to make relevant foreign-language communication accessible to the litigants and the court.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 1 (The Court Interpreters Act is intended \xe2\x80\x9cto insure that all participants in our Federal courts can meaningfully take part.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Documentary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral statements, must be translated to equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.  See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera, 816 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 168, 175 (EDNY 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor a non-English speaking [party] to stand equal with others before the court requires translation [of relevant documents].\xe2\x80\x9d); Lockett v.

An interpreter, for example, may be called upon to \xe2\x80\x9csight translate\xe2\x80\x9d a written document, i.e., to convey a written foreign-language document\xe2\x80\x99s content orally in English.

But if the interpreter then reads the prepared written translation aloud in court, that task, in Taniguchi\xe2\x80\x99s view, can be charged as \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 11, even though the reading involves no translation of foreign-language expression\xe2\x80\x94written or oral\xe2\x80\x94at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly hard to categorize is the common court-interpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign language, transcribing it, then translating it into Eng- lish.  See Gonz\xc3\xa1lez 439.  Although this task involves oral foreign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi contends, qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d because it involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).
