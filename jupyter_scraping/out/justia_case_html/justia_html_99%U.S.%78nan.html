A canal boat laden with coal for transportation, having on board the wife and children of the captain, is not "a barge carrying passengers" within the meaning of sec. 4492, Rev.Stat., which requires such a barge, while in tow of a steamer, to be provided with "fire buckets, axes, life preservers, and yawls."  The motion to dismiss is denied, but that to affirm is granted.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
