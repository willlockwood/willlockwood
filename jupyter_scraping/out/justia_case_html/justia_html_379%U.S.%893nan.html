The Commission has ruled that a spot announcement wherein President Eisenhower, then a candidate for re- election, appeared appealing for a Community Fund Drive constituted a use requiring equal time to all other candidates. Columbia Broadcasting System, 14 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 524 (1956). The Commission, in a divided decision, held, in 1956, that the Democratic candidate for President, the Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson, was not entitled to equal time resulting from use of the network facilities by the Republican candidate, President Eisenhower, to report on the Suez crisis. Columbia Broadcasting System, 14 Pike and Fischer, Radio Reg. 720 (1956). Finally, the Commission has recently held that the full broadcasting of a presidential news conference would be subject to the equal time requirement. Columbia Broadcasting System, F.C.C. 64-887, 56865 (Sept. 30, 1964). These varied holdings of the Commission, and the express language of the Act, confirm my view of the substantiality of the question and the need for immediate argument and speedy decision of this case.</ul> <ul>\'The importance of the question is, I believe, plainly apparent. The statute reflects a deep congressional conviction and policy that in our democratic society all qualified candidates should be given equally free access to broadcasting facilities, regardless of office or financial means, if any candidate is granted free time. This Court, in the recent past, has recognized the importance of making broadcasting facilities \'available to candidates for office without discrimination.\' Farmers Educational &amp; Cooperative Union v.
