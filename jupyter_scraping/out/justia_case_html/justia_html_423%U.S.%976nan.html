[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p></p><p> On October 19, 1973, appellee filed suit in the United States District Court. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201, 2202 that the statute under which the prosecutor was proceeding was unconstitutional. The complaint also sought to enjoin any further proceedings in the Adams Circuit Court, relief premised on 42 U.S. C. 1983. On November 14, 1974, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and the relief sought. </p><p> The Court today vacates the judgment below and remands for consideration in light of its decision last Term in Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd. , <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html">420 U.S. 592</a> (1975). Huffman, a case involving a similar nuisance statute from Ohio, held that the principles of Younger v. Harris, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U.S. 37</a> (1971), which limit federal court equitable interference with state court criminal proceedings, are also applicable to certain state court proceedings which are \'in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes . . ..\' 420 U.S., at 604. Accordingly, the Court in Huffman v. Pursue remanded for a determination whether under the facts of the action \'extraordinary circumstances\' existed bringing the case within the narrow exceptions to Younger\'s general bar. </p><p> But in the instant case, the, Distrist Court anticipated Huffman v. Pursue and, for the very reasons relied on by this Court in that case, clearly held that Younger principles were applicable. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] That Court then proceeded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="979">Page 423 U.S. 976 , 979</a></p><p> to an extended analysis of the factual situation and concluded that the case fell within the Younger exceptions as involving a </p><ul>\'statutory scheme here . . . arguably in several respects \'flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it." Nihiser v. Sendak, 405 F.Supp. 482, 494 (N.D.Ind.1974).</ul> <p> The Court concluded that the provisions rendering admissible \'general reputation\' evidence and constituting such evidence sufficient \'prima facie\' evidence of the existence of the nuisance imposed an unconstitutional prior restraint upon freedom of expression because there was not first required a judicial determination of the obscenity of any specific materials, and because the censor was not required to bear the burden of proving obscenity. The Court emphasized that the statute provided for the seizure and destruction of materials which had never been judicially determined to be obscene, and for the seizure and destruction of constitutionally protected materials \'merely because they are found in a place which has a reputation of exhibiting obscene films . . ..\' Id., at 495. Furthermore, the Court emphasized, once a closing order has issued, the statutory scheme permits future restraints against exhibition of all films unless the owner first discharges the burden of demonstrating their nonobscenity. And if such a showing is made and a release from the closing order obtained, the owner must thereafter \'determine at his peril what </p><p><a class="page-number" name="980">Page 423 U.S. 976 , 980</a></p><p> is literally or arguably within the definition of \'nuisance." Ibid. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p></p><p> Finally, and of particular significance, the District Court held the definitional section of the statute to be \'flagrantly and patently in violation of express constitutional guarantees.\' Id., at 496. The statute defines as a nuisance a place at which \'lewd, indecent, lascivious or obscene\' films are exhibited. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] The Court reached its conclusion upon the authority of two Indiana Supreme Court decisions which struck down criminal obscenity statutes employing the same definition on the ground that it was too general in nature under the principles announced in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U.S. 15</a> (1973). Mohney v. State, Ind., 300 N.E.2d 66 (1973); Stroud v. State, Ind., 300 N.E.2d 100 ( 1973). </p><p> Thus the case fits precisely within the clearly settled Younger exception permitting federal courts to grant relief against state authorities who proceed under a statute \'flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it.\' This exception, first fashioned in Watson v. Buck, <a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html#402">313 U.S. 387, 402</a> (1941), and reaffirmed in Younger, supra, 401 U.S. at 53-54, was twice recognized in Huffman itself, 420 U.S., at 602, 611. Therefore the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed. The Court\'s remand to require the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="981">Page 423 U.S. 976 , 981</a></p><p> District Court to do over what it has done already makes no sense whatever.

Ind.Stat.Ann. 9-2717 (Supp.1974). In this context the District Court found the statutory scheme to be an attempt to circumvent the safeguards attendant upon formal criminal proceedings. Nihiser v. Sendak, supra, at 496. </p><p><a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a> Ind.Stat.Ann. 9-2711(d) (Supp.1974). </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a> It is no answer that the Court said in Huffman that the Ohio nuisance statute there involved did not fit within the \'flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions\' exception to Younger, 420 U.S., at 611-612 &amp; n. 23, since one Ohio state court decision had narrowly construed the scope of the statute, id., at n. 23 and another had construed the Ohio definition of obscenity as comporting with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California, id., at 596 n. 4. In sharp contrast, Indiana court decisions have not narrowed the scope of the Indiana nuisance statute and the Indiana Supreme Court, in the two decisions relied upon by the District Court, has held that the same definition of obscenity appearing in Indiana\'s criminal obscenity statutes does not satisfy the specificity standards of Miller. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
