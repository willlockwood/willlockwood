JUSTICE STORY delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The rule of the Court for docketing and dismissing causes has never been applied to any cases where, before the motion was made, the cause had been actually placed on the docket.  In the present case, the motion to dismiss and the motion to docket the cause are contemporaneous.  The Court is of opinion that under such circumstances, the motion to docket the cause ought to be allowed upon the usual bond for the clerk\'s fees being given.  For this purpose, time will be given to the plaintiff in error (as it is asked) until 1 March next.  If by that time no bond is given, the cause will then be dismissed according the motion of the defendant in error.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
