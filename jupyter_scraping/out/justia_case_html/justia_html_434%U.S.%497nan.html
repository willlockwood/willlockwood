JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>An Arizona trial judge granted the prosecutor\'s motion for a mistrial predicated on improper and prejudicial comment during defense counsel\'s opening statement.  In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, a Federal District Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause protected the defendant from another trial.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The questions presented are whether the record reflects the kind of "necessity" for the mistrial ruling that will avoid a valid plea of double jeopardy, and if so, whether the plea must nevertheless be allowed because the Arizona trial judge did not fully explain the reasons for his mistrial ruling.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1971, respondent was found guilty of murdering a hotel night clerk.  In 1973, the Superior Court of Pima County, Ariz., ordered a new trial because the prosecutor had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the new trial order in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s second trial began in January, 1975.  During the <em>voir dire</em> examination of prospective jurors, the prosecutor made reference to the fact that some of the witnesses whose testimony the jurors would hear had testified in proceedings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 434 U. S. 499</a></p><p> four years earlier. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Defense counsel told the prospective jurors "that there was evidence hidden from [respondent] at the last trial."  In his opening statement, he made this point more forcefully:</p>\n<p>"You will hear testimony that, notwithstanding the fact that we had a trial in May of 1971 in this matter, that the prosecutor hid those statements and didn\'t give those to the lawyer for George saying the man was Spanish speaking, didn\'t give those statements at all, hid them."</p>\n<p>"You will hear that that evidence was suppressed and hidden by the prosecutor in that case.  You will hear that that evidence was purposely withheld.  You will hear that, because of the misconduct of the County Attorney at that time and because he withheld evidence, that the Supreme Court of Arizona granted a new trial in this case."</p>\n<p>App. 18181, 184.</p>\n<p>After opening statements were completed, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial.  In colloquy during argument of the motion, the trial judge expressed the opinion that evidence concerning the reasons for the new trial, and specifically the ruling of the Arizona Supreme Court, was irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence, and therefore inadmissible.  Defense counsel asked for an opportunity "to find some law" that would support his belief that the Supreme Court opinion would be admissible. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  After further argument, the judge stated that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 434 U. S. 500</a></p><p> he would withhold ruling on the admissibility of the evidence and denied the motion for mistrial.  Two witnesses then testified.</p>\n<p>The following morning, the prosecutor renewed his mistrial motion.  Fortified by an evening\'s research, he argued that there was no theory on which the basis for the new trial ruling could be brought to the attention of the jury, that the prejudice to the jury could not be repaired by any cautionary instructions, and that a mistrial was a "manifest necessity."  Defense counsel stated that he still was not prepared with authority supporting his belief that the Supreme Court opinion was admissible. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  He argued that his comment was invited by the prosecutor\'s reference to the witnesses\' earlier testimony </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 434 U. S. 501</a></p><p> and that any prejudice could be avoided by curative instructions.  During the extended argument, the trial judge expressed his concern about the possibility that an erroneous mistrial ruling would preclude another trial. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Ultimately the trial judge granted the motion, stating that his ruling was based upon defense counsel\'s remarks in his opening statement concerning the Arizona Supreme Court opinion.  The trial judge did not expressly find that there was "manifest necessity" for a mistrial; nor did he expressly state that he had considered alternative solutions and concluded that none would be adequate.  The Arizona Supreme Court refused to review the mistrial ruling. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging that another trial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  After reviewing the transcript of the state proceeding, and hearing the arguments of counsel, the Federal District Judge noted that the Arizona trial judge had not canvassed on the record the possibility of alternatives to a mistrial and expressed the view that before granting a mistrial motion the judge was required "to find that manifest necessity exists for the granting of it." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Because the record contained no such finding, and because the federal judge was not prepared to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 434 U. S. 502</a></p><p> make such a finding himself, he granted the writ. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  He agreed with the State, however, that defense counsel\'s opening statement had been improper.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit also characterized the opening statement as improper, but affirmed because, absent a finding of manifest necessity or an explicit consideration of alternatives, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the court was unwilling to infer that the jury was prevented from arriving at a fair and impartial verdict. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In a concurring opinion, two judges noted that, while the question of manifest necessity had been argued, most of the argument on the mistrial motion had concerned the question whether the opening statement was improper.  They concluded that,</p>\n<p>"absent findings that manifest necessity existed, it . . . [was] quite possible that the grant of mistrial was based on the fact that the impropriety of counsel\'s conduct had been established </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 434 U. S. 503</a></p><p> without reaching the question whether there could, nevertheless, be a fair trial."</p>\n<p>546 F.2d at 833.</p>\n<p>We are persuaded that the Court of Appeals applied an inappropriate standard of review to mistrial rulings of this kind, and attached undue significance to the form of the ruling.  We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>A State may not put a defendant in jeopardy twice for the same offense.  <em>Benton v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/case.html">395 U. S. 784</a></span>.  The constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal.  The public interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that an acquitted defendant may not be retried even though "the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation."  <em>See Fong Foo v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html">369 U. S. 141</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/case.html#143">369 U. S. 143</a></span>.  If the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair.</p>\n<p>Because jeopardy attaches before the judgment becomes final, the constitutional protection also embraces the defendant\'s "valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal." [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The reasons why this "valued right" merits constitutional protection are worthy of repetition.  Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair.  It increases the financial and emotional burden </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 434 U. S. 504</a></p><p> on the accused, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 434 U. S. 505</a></p><p> Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.</p>\n<p>Unlike the situation in which the trial has ended in an acquittal or conviction, retrial is not automatically barred when a criminal proceeding is terminated without finally resolving the merits of the charges against the accused.  Because of the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably create unfairness to the accused, his valued right to have the trial concluded by a particular tribunal is sometimes subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Yet, in view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar.  His burden is a heavy one.  The prosecutor must demonstrate "manifest necessity" for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.</p>\n<p>The words "manifest necessity" appropriately characterize the magnitude of the prosecutor\'s burden. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  For that reason </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 434 U. S. 506</a></p><p> Mr. Justice Story\'s classic formulation of the test [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] has been quoted over and over again to provide guidance in the decision of a wide variety of cases. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Nevertheless, those words do not describe a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Indeed, it is manifest that the key word "necessity" cannot be interpreted literally; instead, contrary to the teaching of Webster, we assume that there are degrees of necessity, and we require a "high degree" before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 434 U. S. 507</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The question whether that "high degree" has been reached is answered more easily in some kinds of cases than in others.  At one extreme are cases in which a prosecutor requests a mistrial in order to buttress weaknesses in his evidence.  Although there was a time when English judges served the Stuart monarchs by exercising a power to discharge a jury whenever it appeared that the Crown\'s evidence would be insufficient to convict, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] the prohibition against double jeopardy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 434 U. S. 508</a></p><p> as it evolved in this country was plainly intended to condemn this "abhorrent" practice. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  As this Court noted in <em>United States v. Dinitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/600/case.html">424 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/600/case.html#611">424 U. S. 611</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"The Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions.  It bars retrials where \'bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor\' . . . threatens the \'[h]arassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict\' the defendant."</p>\n<p>Thus, the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] or when there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superior resources of the State to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 434 U. S. 509</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the other extreme is the mistrial premised upon the trial judge\'s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict, long considered the classic basis for a proper mistrial. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The argument that a jury\'s inability to agree establishes reasonable doubt as to the defendant\'s guilt, and therefore requires acquittal, has been uniformly rejected in this country.  Instead, without exception, the courts have held that the trial judge may discharge a genuinely deadlocked jury and require the defendant to submit to a second trial.  This rule accords recognition to society\'s interest in giving the prosecution one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in this situation there are especially compelling reasons for allowing the trial judge to exercise broad discretion in deciding whether or not "manifest necessity" justifies a discharge of the jury.  On the one hand, if he discharges the jury when further deliberations may produce a fair verdict, the defendant is deprived of his "valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal."  But if he fails to discharge a jury which is unable to reach a verdict after protracted and exhausting deliberations, there exists a significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors.  If retrial of the defendant were barred whenever an appellate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 434 U. S. 510</a></p><p> court views the "necessity" for a mistrial differently from the trial judge, there would be a danger that the latter, cognizant of the serious societal consequences of an erroneous ruling, would employ coercive means to break the apparent deadlock.  Such a rule would frustrate the public interest in just judgments. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  The trial judge\'s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is therefore accorded great deference by a reviewing court. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>We are persuaded that, along the spectrum of trial problems which may warrant a mistrial and which vary in their amenability to appellate scrutiny, the difficulty which led to the mistrial in this case also falls in an area where the trial judge\'s determination is entitled to special respect.</p>\n<p>In this case, the trial judge ordered a mistrial because the defendant\'s lawyer made improper and prejudicial remarks during his opening statement to the jury.  Although respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 434 U. S. 511</a></p><p> insists that evidence of prosecutorial misconduct [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] was admissible as a matter of Arizona law, and therefore that the opening statement was proper, we regard this issue as foreclosed by respondent\'s failure to proffer any Arizona precedent supportive of his contention [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] and by the state court\'s interpretation of its own law, buttressed by the consistent opinion of the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals.  <em>Cf. Bishop v. Wood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html">426 U. S. 341</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html#346">426 U. S. 346</a></span>-347.  We therefore start from the premise that defense counsel\'s comment was improper and may have affected the impartiality of the jury.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the extent of the possible bias cannot be measured, and that the District Court was quite correct in believing that some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions.  In a strict, literal sense, the mistrial was not "necessary."  Nevertheless, the overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that we accord the highest degree of respect to the trial judge\'s evaluation of the likelihood that the impartiality of one or more jurors may have been affected by the improper comment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 434 U. S. 512</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The consistent course of decision in this Court in cases involving possible juror bias supports this conclusion.  <em>Simmons v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/148/case.html">142 U. S. 148</a></span>, involved the possibility of bias caused by a newspaper story describing a letter written by defense counsel denying a charge by a third party that one of the jurors was acquainted with the defendant.  Without determining the truth or falsity of the charge, and without examining the jurors to ascertain what influence the story had upon them, the trial judge declared a mistrial because he considered it</p>\n<p>"\'impossible that in the future consideration of this case by the jury there can be that true independence and freedom of action on the part of each juror which is necessary to a fair trial of the accused.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/148/case.html#150">142 U. S. 150</a></span>.  This Court affirmed, holding that the judge was justified in concluding that the publication of the letter had made it impossible for the jury "to act with the independence and freedom on the part of each juror requisite to a fair trial of the issue between the parties."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/155/case.html">142 U. S. 155</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Thompson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/271/case.html">155 U. S. 271</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/271/case.html#279">155 U. S. 279</a></span>, the Court concluded that a mistrial was required when it was revealed that one of the trial jurors had served on the grand jury that indicted the defendant.  Since it is possible that the grand jury had heard no more evidence -- and perhaps even less -- than was presented at the trial, and since the juror in question may have had no actual bias against the defendant, the record did not demonstrate that the mistrial was strictly "necessary."  There can be no doubt, however, about the validity of the conclusion that the possibility of bias justified the mistrial.</p>\n<p>An improper opening statement unquestionably tends to frustrate the public interest in having a just judgment reached by an impartial tribunal.  Indeed, such statements create a risk, often not present in the individual juror bias situation, [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] that the entire panel may be tainted.  The trial judge, of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 434 U. S. 513</a></p><p> course, may instruct the jury to disregard the improper comment.  In extreme cases, he may discipline counsel, or even remove him from the trial as he did in <em>United States v. Dinitz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/600/case.html">424 U. S. 600</a></span>.  Those actions, however, will not necessarily remove the risk of bias that may be created by improper argument.  Unless unscrupulous defense counsel are to be allowed an unfair advantage, the trial judge must have the power to declare a mistrial in appropriate cases.  The interest in orderly, impartial procedure would be impaired if he were deterred from exercising that power by a concern that any time a reviewing court disagreed with his assessment of the trial situation a retrial would automatically be barred.  The adoption of a stringent standard of appellate review in this area, therefore, would seriously impede the trial judge in the proper performance of his "duty, in order to protect the integrity of the trial, to take prompt and affirmative action to stop . . . professional misconduct."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/600/case.html#612">424 U.

[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>There are compelling institutional considerations militating in favor of appellate deference to the trial judge\'s evaluation of the significance of possible juror bias.

He is the judge most familiar with the evidence and the background of the case on trial.  He has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered, and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors.  In short, he is far more "conversant with the factors relevant to the determination" than any reviewing court can possibly be.  <em>See Wade v. Hunter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/684/case.html">336 U. S. 684</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/684/case.html#687">336 U. S. 687</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that a trial judge\'s decision to declare a mistrial based on his assessment of the prejudicial impact of improper argument is entitled to great deference does not, of course, end the inquiry.  As noted earlier, a constitutionally protected interest is inevitably affected by any mistrial decision.  The trial judge, therefore,</p>\n<p>"must always temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by considering the importance to the defendant of being able, once and for all, to conclude his confrontation with society through the verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Jorn,</em> 400 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/470/case.html#486">400 U. S. 486</a></span> (Harlan, J.).  In order to ensure that this interest is adequately protected, reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that, in the words of Mr. Justice Story, the trial judge exercised "sound discretion" in declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p>Thus, if a trial judge acts irrationally or irresponsibly, <em>cf. United States v. Jorn, supra; see Illinois v. Somerville,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/458/case.html#469">410 U. S. 469</a></span>, his action cannot be condoned.  But our review of this record indicates that this was not such a case. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Defense </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 434 U. S. 515</a></p><p> counsel aired improper and highly prejudicial evidence before the jury, the possible impact of which the trial judge was in the best position to assess.  The trial judge did not act precipitately in response to the prosecutor\'s request for a mistrial.  On the contrary, evincing a concern for the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling, he gave both defense counsel and the prosecutor full opportunity to explain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 434 U. S. 516</a></p><p> their positions on the propriety of a mistrial.  We are therefore persuaded by the record that the trial judge acted responsibly and deliberately, and accorded careful consideration to respondent\'s interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.  Since he exercised "sound discretion" in handling the sensitive problem of possible juror bias created by the improper comment of defense counsel, the mistrial order is supported by the "high degree" of necessity which is required in a case of this kind. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Neither party has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be tainted by bias; [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] in these circumstances, "the public\'s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgements" [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] must prevail over the defendant\'s "valued right" to have his trial concluded before the first jury impaneled.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>One final matter requires consideration.  The absence of an explicit finding of "manifest necessity" appears to have been determinative for the District Court, and may have been so for the Court of Appeals.  If those courts regarded that omission as critical, [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>] they required too much.  Since the record provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 434 U. S. 517</a></p><p> sufficient justification for the state court ruling, the failure to explain that ruling more completely does not render it constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p>Review of any trial court decision is, of course, facilitated by findings and by an explanation of the reasons supporting the decision.  No matter how desirable such procedural assistance may be, it is not constitutionally mandated in a case such as this.  <em>Cf. Cupp v. Naughten,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/141/case.html">414 U. S. 141</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/141/case.html#146">414 U. S. 146</a></span>.  The basis for the trial judge\'s mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the record, which includes the extensive argument of counsel prior to the judge\'s ruling.  The state trial judge\'s mistrial declaration is not subject to collateral attack in a federal court simply because he failed to find "manifest necessity" in those words or to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.

Later, the trial judge expressed disagreement with defense counsel\'s argument that evidence of prosecutorial misconduct could be admitted on an impeachment theory:</p>\n<p>"I don\'t think you\'re entitled to prove all this misconduct if such is the case, to impeach every witness, ad I think that\'s what you\'re saying to me."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 217-218.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>"I have not worked on that, because I\'m not at that stage yet where I think it\'s necessary to bring that into evidence."  <em>Id.</em> at 243.

Under such circumstances, a mistrial declaration accompanied by a finding that the jury could no longer render an impartial verdict would not be lightly set aside."</p>\n<p>546 F.2d at 832.  The importance of the absence of express findings or reasons to the decision below seems apparent.  The Arizona trial judge "observed the complained-of event" and patiently "heard counsel."  Had he taken the additional step of making an express finding of "manifest necessity," it appears that Judge Kilkenny would have reviewed the mistrial ruling under a less exacting abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>In its opinion as originally released, the court stated:  "[W]e decline to imply from this impropriety that the jury was completely prevented from arriving at a fair and impartial verdict."

The same dispute about the meaning of the word necessity in the exception to this rule is the source of the main questions raised upon this writ of error, and they are in substance answered when we decide on the meaning of that word in the exception to this rule, and apply that meaning to the facts appearing on this record.  We assume it to be clear that the discharge of the jury before verdict may be lawful at some time and under some circumstances.  Then with reference to the facts on this record, we hold that the judge at the first trial had by law power to discharge the jury before verdict, when a high degree of need for such discharge was made evident to his mind from the facts which he had ascertained.

It should be noted, however, that the rationale for this deference in the "hung" jury situation is that the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.  If the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the "sound discretion" entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an appellate court disappears.  Thus, if the trial judge acts for reasons completely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be the basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is appropriate.  <em>Cf.

The decision of the Arizona Supreme Court granting respondent a new trial, in our opinion, does not specifically address the matter.

This case, however, simply stands for the well accepted proposition that a witness may be impeached with evidence tending to show that he has an interest in giving testimony favorable to the State and against the defendant.  It undoubtedly would have been proper for defense counsel to use the statements suppressed at the first trial during the second trial, but there is nothing in <em>Burruell</em> which would suggest that the fact of the suppression would have been admissible for any purpose at the second trial.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, if there is a suggestion of individual juror bias, it may be possible to replace that juror with an alternate.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T32" name="F32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>In his concurring opinion in Dinitz, MR.

Our identification of this reason for according deference to the trial judge in juror bias cases generally is not intended as a comment upon the conduct of defense counsel in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T33" name="F33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>These considerations must be at least as weighty where a federal court, in considering a state prisoner\'s collateral challenge to his conviction on the ground that it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, reviews the determination of a state trial judge as to juror bias.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T34" name="F34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, defense counsel made brief reference during <em>voir dire</em> to the fact that evidence was withheld from the defense at the previous trial.  Later in the <em>voir dire,</em> the prosecutor expressed his concern to the trial judge that, if the jurors were aware of the fact that respondent obtained a new trial because the prosecution failed to produce some evidence, they might be prejudiced against the State.  In response to the prosecutor\'s concern, the trial judge conducted an inquiry into whether the jurors knew the reason for the new trial.  The inquiry revealed that the jurors were not then aware of the reason for the new trial.  During the opening statements which followed, however, defense counsel did not leave the matter to the jurors\' conjecture; instead, he explicitly stated that they would hear testimony showing that the Supreme Court of Arizona granted respondent a new trial because the prosecutor deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.  Following completion of opening argument, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p>During argument on the prosecutor\'s motion, defense counsel insisted that evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in a prior proceeding was admissible for impeachment purposes; although he could offer no authority to support this novel proposition, he indicated to the judge that he would appreciate an opportunity to "find . . . some written law, which would allow this type of testimony . . . as evidence."  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#500">434 U. S. 500</a></span> n. 3.  While the trial judge remarked that he could conceive of no basis for the admission of such evidence and that he was tempted to grant the prosecutor\'s request immediately because of defense counsel\'s injection of the prosecutorial misconduct issue into the trial, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#499">434 U. S. 499</a></span>-500, n. 3, he did not act precipitately.  Rather, proceeding with caution and giving defense counsel the benefit of the doubt, App. 223, the trial judge reserved ruling on the admissibility question and at first denied the mistrial motion.  In avoiding a hasty decision despite his conviction that the evidence was improper, the trial judge was plainly acting out of concern for the double jeopardy interests implicated by an improvident mistrial.  <em>Id.</em> at 225, 253.</p>\n<p>The following day the prosecutor renewed his motion.   The trial judge heard extensive argument from both sides regarding both the propriety of defense counsel\'s opening statement and the need for a mistrial.  Defense counsel contended that any prejudice which might have resulted from the references to prosecutorial misconduct could be cured by cautionary instructions; the prosecutor argued that such an alternative would be inadequate to remove the risk of taint.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>Two considerations, while not determinative, add support to this conclusion.  First, crowded calendars throughout the Nation impose a constant pressure on our judges to finish the business at hand.  Generally they have an interest in having the trial completed as promptly as possible, an interest which frequently parallels the constitutionally protected interest of the accused in having the trial concluded by a particular tribunal.  Second, respondent does not attempt to demonstrate specific prejudice from the mistrial ruling, other than the harm which always accompanies retrial.  <em>Cf. McNeal v. Hollowell,</em> 481 F.2d 1145, 1147 (CA5 1973).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T36" name="F36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>United States v.

We think this concern was unwarranted.  Shortly after defense counsel made his first, brief reference to the withholding of evidence in the earlier trial, the judge indicated his concern regarding the possible "poisoning of the panel."  In addition, both sides argued the question of juror bias and offered their views on whether action short of a mistrial would suffice to eliminate the risk of taint.  Finally, the trial judge indicated his awareness of the grave consequences of an erroneous mistrial ruling.  We are unwilling to assume that a judge, who otherwise acted responsibly and deliberately, simply neglected to consider one of the central issues presented by the mistrial motion and argued by the parties when he made his ruling.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that the failure of a state trial judge to express the legal standard under which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 434 U. S. 518</a></p><p> he has declared a mistrial is, in itself and without further examination of the record, sufficient reason to infer constitutional error foreclosing a second trial.  The Court\'s opinion in <em>Townsend v. Sain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html">372 U. S. 293</a></span> (1963), is to the contrary.  There, in the course of a full scale exposition of the proper approach to be followed by a federal court in determining whether a writ of habeas corpus should be issued on the petition of a state prisoner, the Court addressed the situation where the state trial judge, in making the challenged ruling, did not articulate the constitutional standard under which he acted.  The Court concluded that</p>\n<p>"the coequal responsibilities of state and federal judges in the administration of federal constitutional law are such that we think the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation, properly assume that the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact applied."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html#314">372 U. S. 314</a></span>-315.  A silent record is not a sufficient basis for concluding that the state judge has committed constitutional error; the mere possibility of error is not enough to warrant habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appals, as well as the District Court, was therefore in error in granting relief without further examination of the record to determine whether the use of an incorrect legal standard was sufficiently indicated by something beyond mere silence and, if not, whether the declaration of a mistrial, which the Court of Appeals said it was "normally inclined to uphold," at least in the absence of "clear abuse of discretion," was constitutionally vulnerable.  I would not, however, undertake an examination of the record here in the first instance.  Rather, I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and direct that court to remand the case to the District Court to make the initial judgment, under the correct legal standard, as to whether the writ should issue.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 434 U. S. 519</a></p><p> This disagreement with the Court\'s disposition leads me to dissent.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today holds that another trial of respondent, following a mistrial declared over his vehement objection, is not prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  To reach this result, my Brethren accord a substantial degree of deference to a trial court finding that the Court simply assumes was made but that appears nowhere in the record.  Because of the silence of the record on the crucial question whether there was "manifest necessity" for a mistrial, I believe that another trial of respondent would violate his constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with the majority is a narrow one.  I fully concur in its view that the constitutional protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause "embraces the defendant\'s <em>valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,\'" since a second prosecution inevitably\n</em></p>\n<p>"increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#503">434 U. S. 503</a></span>-504 (footnotes omitted).  For these reasons, I also agree that, where a mistrial is declared over a defendant\'s objections, a new trial is permissible only if the termination of the earlier trial was justified by a "manifest necessity," and that the prosecution must shoulder the "heavy" burden of demonstrating such a "high degree" of necessity.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#505">434 U.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Where I part ways from the Court is in it assumption that an "assessment of the prejudicial impact of improper argument," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#514">434 U. S. 514</a></span>, sufficient to support the need for a mistrial, may be implied from this record.  As the courts below found, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] it is not apparent on the face of the record that termination of the trial was justified by a "manifest necessity" or was the only means by which the "ends of public justice" could be fulfilled, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/579/case.html">United States v. Perez,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 579,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/579/case.html#580">22 U.

Defense counsel\'s improper remarks occupied only one page of a lengthy opening statement.  Despite the fact that the prosecutor had vigorously interrupted the opening statement at numerous points to assert various objections, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] he made no objection to the remarks that formed the basis for the mistrial.  If the argument of defense counsel had had a visibly obvious impact on the jurors when uttered, it is hard to believe that this prosecutor would have waited until after the opening statement was finished and the luncheon recess concluded before making his objection known.</p>\n<p>Although, from this distance and in the absence of express findings, it is impossible to determine the precise extent to which defense counsel\'s remarks may have prejudiced the jury against the State, the circumstances set forth above suggest that any such prejudice may have been minimal and subject to cure through less drastic alternatives. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  For example, the jury could have been instructed to disregard any mention of prior legal rulings as irrelevant to the issues at hand, and to consider as evidence only the testimony and exhibits admitted through witnesses on the stand. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Were there doubt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 434 U. S. 522</a></p><p> whether such instructions alone would suffice to cure the taint, the jury could have been questioned about the extent of any prejudice. Given the anticipated length of the trial (almost two weeks), [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] it is not unlikely that, had the jury been appropriately instructed when the court first found defense counsel to have erred in his opening statement, any prejudice would have dissipated before deliberations were to begin.  For these reasons, it is impossible to conclude that  finding of necessity was implicit in the mere grant of the mistrial. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 434 U. S. 523</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As the majority concedes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#501">434 U. S. 501</a></span>, there was no express determination or evaluation by the trial court of the degree of prejudice caused by the improper remarks; nor was there any exploration of possible alternatives to the drastic solution of declaring a mistrial; nor, indeed, any express indication on the face of the record that the trial court was aware of the dictates of the <em>Perez</em> doctrine.  Over the two days during which the mistrial motion was argued, the entire thrust of the trial court\'s questions and comments was to determine whether there was any legal basis for admitting into evidence the Arizona Supreme Court\'s ruling that the prosecution in an earlier trial had suppressed evidence exculpatory of respondent, to which ruling defense counsel had adverted in opening statement. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  The tenor of the court\'s remarks throughout -- including its statement in declaring the mistrial [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] -- suggests that the only question considered was that of admissibility. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 434 U. S. 524</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the trial court\'s exploration of the evidentiary question was conscientious and deliberate.  The majority infers from this care that the trial court must have been aware of the correct legal standard governing the permissibility of retrials following mistrials, and must impliedly, though not expressly, have made the requisite findings of necessity.  The deliberation with which the trial court dealt with the evidentiary issue, however, only highlights its failure to address what I believe must be the key inquiry:  whether a mistrial, and its abrogation of a defendant\'s constitutionally protected interest in completing his trial before a particular tribunal, <em>United States v. Jorn,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/470/case.html">400 U. S. 470</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/470/case.html#486">400 U.

S. 525</a></p><p> For example, where the nature of the error is one that "would make reversal [of any conviction] on appeal a certainty," <em>Illinois v. Somerville,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/458/case.html">410 U. S. 458</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/458/case.html#464">410 U. S. 464</a></span> (1973), the appropriate finding may be implied from the declaration of a mistrial. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  What the "manifest necessity" doctrine does require, in my view, is that the record make clear either that there were no meaningful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or that the trial court scrupulously considered available alternatives and found all wanting but a termination of the proceedings.  <em>See United States v. Jorn, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/470/case.html#485">400 U. S. 485</a></span>; <em>Illinois v.

The record here, as demonstrated above, does neither.</p>\n<p>Where the need for a mistrial is not "plain and obvious," <em>United States v. Perez,</em> 9 Wheat. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/579/case.html#580">22 U. S. 580</a></span>, the importance of an affirmative indication that the trial court made the relevant findings is apparent.  In the chaos of conducting a trial, with the welter of administrative as well as legal concerns that must occupy the mind of the trial judge, it is all too easy to overlook a legal rule or relevant factor in rendering decision.  A requirement of some statement on the record addressed to the need for a mistrial would ensure that appropriate consideration is given to the efficacy of other alternatives and that mistrial decisions are not based upon improper, or only partly adequate, criteria.  Of particular relevance here, moreover, it would facilitate proper appellate and habeas review, avoiding the need to speculate on the basis for the decision to terminate the trial. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  These considerations have special force when a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="526">Page 434 U. S. 526</a></p><p> mistrial is sought on the ground of jury bias resulting from trial counsel\'s error.  The trial court is uniquely situated to evaluate the seriousness of any such prejudice, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#513">434 U. S. 513</a></span>-514, and its failure contemporaneously to do so may preclude meaningful subsequent determination of whether the mistrial was properly granted over the defendant\'s objection.  Thus, where the necessity for a mistrial is not manifest on the face of the record, I would hold that the record must clearly indicate that the trial court made a considered choice among the available alternatives. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>Had the court here explored alternatives on the record, or made a finding of substantial and incurable prejudice or other "manifest necessity," this would b a different case and one in which I would agree with both the majority\'s reasoning and its result. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  On this ambiguous record, however, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 434 U. S. 527</a></p><p> absence of any such finding -- and indeed of any express indication that the trial court applied the manifest necessity doctrine -- leaves open the substantial possibility that there was in fact no need to terminate the proceedings.  While the Court states that a "high degree" of necessity is required before a mistrial may properly be granted, its reading of the record here is inconsistent with this principle.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>This proposition is essentially unremarkable.  It is a truism that findings of fact by the trial court may not be set aside on appeal unless "clearly erroneous," and that, on review, appropriate deference must be given to the trial court\'s opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a); <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/100/case.html">395 U.

While the determination that there is no alternative but a mistrial to cure prejudice created by an improper opening statement is in part one of law, in a case of this sort, it is based primarily on a factual evaluation of the extent to which the particular jury has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Contrary to the majority\'s implication, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#502">434 U. S. 502</a></span> nn. 8-9, the courts below did not hold that the absence of express findings relating to the necessity for a mistrial was by itself dispositive.  Rather, the rulings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals were based on their respective conclusions that on this record it could not independently be determined that "the jury was prevented from arriving at a fair and impartial verdict," and therefore that a finding of manifest necessity was not implicit in this record.  546 F.2d 832; <em>see</em> App. 128-129 (District Court\'s view that any prejudice could have been cured by cautionary instruction).</p>\n<p>Nor can I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals applied an inappropriate standard of review.

But this is so, noted the court, where</p>\n<p>"[i]n the usual case, the trial judge has observed the complained-of event, heard counsel, and made specific findings.

However, it must be recognized that the cases are legion in which convictions have been upheld despite the jury\'s exposure to improper material relating to the defendant\'s past conduct, often because curative instructions have been found sufficient to dispel any prejudice.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bloom,</em> 538 F.2d 704, 710 (CA5 1976); <em>id.</em> at 711 (Tuttle, J., concurring); <em>United States v.

If instructions may be found to have cured prosecutorial error relating to the defendant\'s past misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt, they ought surely to be considered in deciding whether to subject a defendant to a second trial because of defense error in referring to past misconduct by the prosecution.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Tr. of <em>Voir Dire</em> by Defendant\'s Counsel 22.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>In this respect, the instant case differs markedly from the situation in <em>Thompson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/271/case.html">155 U.

There, upon discovery that one of the petit jurors had served on the grand jury indicting the defendant, the trial court immediately announced that, "[if it] is insisted on by the gentlemen, there is no way left but for the court to discharge the jury on that ground. . . ."  Record in No. 637, O.T. 1893, p. 20.  Defense counsel objected to the juror\'s participation, but also objected to a discharge of the jury, arguing that he was entitled to an acquittal once having been placed in jeopardy.  The trial court was of the view, clearly correct, that, had the juror remained on the panel despite counsel\'s objection, any conviction would have been reversed.  <em>Id.</em> at 21-22.  That being the case, the trial court held that the jury could be discharged and a new jury impaneled without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  This Court affirmed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, while the trial court repeatedly challenged defense counsel on his theories for admissibility of the Arizona Supreme Court\'s ruling, <em>see</em> App. 204, 205, 209, 211, 217, 248, not once did the court refer to "manifest necessity"; question defense counsel as to the nature of any curative instructions that might be propounded; or otherwise indicate a consciousness that mere error on either side is insufficient to warrant the grant of a mistrial over defense objections, <em>see</em> <l=|434 497fn2="" 4|="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>supra.</em></l=|434></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>"Based upon defense counsel\'s remarks in his opening statement concerning the Arizona Supreme Court opinion and its effect for the reasons for the new trial, the motion for mistrial will be granted."</p>\n<p>App. 271-272.  As was noted in the Court of Appeals, the circumstances of the argument on the mistrial motion and the ruling itself make it</p>\n<p>"quite possible that the grant of mistrial was based on the fact that the impropriety of counsel\'s conduct had been established without reaching the question whether there could, nevertheless, be a fair trial."</p>\n<p>546 F.2d at 833 (Merrill, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority relies on three aspects of the record to support its conclusion that the trial court did make an evaluation of the prejudicial impact of counsel\'s remarks and of the need for a mistrial to correct the error.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#514">434 U. S. 514</a></span>-515, n. 34,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/497/case.html#517">434 U. S. 517</a></span> n. 39.  The first is that the trial court was aware of the double jeopardy consequences of an improvidently granted mistrial, namely, that the defendant may not be tried again.  While this is true, none of the comments by the court suggests a concern with the propriety of anything other than its ruling on the evidentiary question.  <em>See</em> App. 225, 253.  Second, the majority points to the fact that counsel each argued whether the prejudice could be cured by means other than a mistrial.  But such argument occupied only a minuscule portion of each side\'s discussion and elicited no comment or response from the court.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court notes that at the <em>voir dire</em> of the jury, the trial court expressed concern about "poisoning of the panel" and that to allay this concern, the jury was questioned as to its knowledge of the reasons for a new trial.  The transcript of the <em>voir dire,</em> however, suggests that this questioning had two purposes:  to determine whether any jurors knew why there was a second trial, and to determine whether such knowledge would prejudice them in their deliberations.  Tr. of <em>Voir Dire, supra</em> at 35.  Since no jurors knew of the reason for the new trial, no inquiry was made as to prejudice -- recognized at this time by the court and by counsel as a separate issue.  None of these portions of the record establishes that the trial court at any time made a determination that the prejudice from counsel\'s opening statement could not be cured by an instruction, or that the court had any basis, such as through a <em>voir dire,</em> on which to make such a determination.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Thompson v.

United States ex rel. Johnson v. Chairman of N.Y. State Bd. of Parole,</em> 500 F.2d 925, 928-934 (CA2), <em>vacated as moot,</em> 419 U.S. 1015 (1974).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>Given the importance of respondent\'s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding unnecessary second trials, <em>United States v.

I do not go this far here, but only observe that we have held in numerous contexts that governmental decisionmakers must state their reasons for decision, particularly where the decision is adverse to the constitutionally or statutorily protected interests of an individual.  <em>See, e.g., Morrissey v.
