I then examined this process and found it without any endorsement, and took the earliest opportunity to inquire of Mr. Fox as to the service of the subpoena, who informed me he did not recollect having served it.

Whether the endorsement on the said process of subpoena would, after service thereof, create any legal impediment to the payment of the money over to the said Johnston by the said Bryan Hampson, and would, in case of such payment after service, make the said Bryan Hampson personally liable for the amount so paid over."</p>\n<p>"If the court should be of opinion that the said marshal was not bound to have served the said process, if in his power to do so at any time previous to 20 June, 1805 (unless he was specially required by the plaintiff to serve the same, notwithstanding he received the same as marshal on the day on which the said process issued), then the judgment is to be rendered for the defendant."</p>\n<p>"And if, under the circumstances mentioned in the second question, the court should be of opinion that the said Bryan Hampson would not be personally liable for the amount so paid over, and that his not being personally liable would be sufficient to discharge the marshal from any liability in this case, then judgment is to be rendered for the defendant."</p>\n<p>"But if both those questions are decided for the plaintiff, then judgment upon the verdict is to be rendered for him."</p>\n<p>The court below was of opinion that the statement of the case was not full enough to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, and directed judgment to be entered up for the defendant, whereupon the plaintiff brought his writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 10 U.
