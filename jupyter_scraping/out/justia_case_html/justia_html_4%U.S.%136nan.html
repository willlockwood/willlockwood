No inconvenience can arise from the transaction, if all the parties are apprised of the distributive appropriation. It is essential, however, to such a remittance, that notice should be given to the parties. In the present case, there is no proof of express notice to the plaintiff; but this may be supplied by facts, which raise a fair presumption of the plaintiff\'s knowledge on the subject: and his delay in protesting and returning the bill, together with the draft on Portener, sent directly by the defendants to him, are facts of that description. </p><p> It only remains to observe, that Portener, the general trustee, could give no preference to any claimant on the fund; and that in case of a partial loss, it must have been borne, as a general average, by all the concerned. </p><p> Verdict for the defendants. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> An outline of this case was annexed in a note to the case of Ingraham v.
