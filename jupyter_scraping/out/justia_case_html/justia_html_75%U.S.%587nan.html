JUSTICE GRIER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The act of July 1, 1862, has been inserted in the bond <em>ex majori cautela,</em> for it is admitted that the Act of June 30, 1864, entitled "An act to provide internal revenue, to support the government, to pay the interest on the public debt, and for other purposes" is the only act applicable to this case.  The act of 1862 was repealed by it.</p>\n<p>As might be expected in an act embracing the almost innumerable subjects of taxation contained in this one and covering more than seventy pages of the statute book, provisions may probably be found in one part of it difficult to be reconciled with some contained in other parts.  Yet when carefully examined, we find no difficulty in answering the question proposed.</p>\n<p>The seventy-first section of the act is the one which prescribes the conditions under which licenses shall be given.</p>\n<p>The seventy-third section subjects all persons who neglect it to fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The seventy-fourth section fixes the limit to the license, beyond which time the parties to the bond are not bound to answer for any breach of the condition.</p>\n<p>The provisions of the fifty-third and ninety-fourth sections of the act, which subject distillers of coal oil to the provisions of the act applicable to the distillers of spirits "so far as the same may, in the judgment of the Commissioner of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="590">Page 75 U. S. 590</a></p><p> Internal Revenue, be deemed necessary," have no application to the point.  The commissioner has exercised no judgment, and prescribed no regulations on the subject, so far as appears.  The bond has no reference to such conditions as are required in distillery bonds, and cannot be affected by them.  "<em>Tis not so written in the bond."\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Ordered that it be certified to the judges of the circuit court, in answer to the question submitted, that the defendants are not liable.</em></p>\n<p>* 13 Stat. at Large 248; and see \xc2\xa7 79, art. 19.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
