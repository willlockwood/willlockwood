Respondents P. J. Video, Inc., and James Erhardt were charged in the village of Depew, New York, Justice Court with six counts of obscenity in the third degree under \xc2\xa7 235.05(1) of the New York Penal Law. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents moved to suppress five videocassette movies that had been seized from respondents\' store, and that formed the basis for the obscenity charges </p><p><a class="page-number" name="870">Page 475 U. S. 870</a></p><p> against respondents, on the ground that the warrant authorizing the seizure was issued without probable cause to believe that the movies were obscene.  The Justice Court granted the motion and dismissed the informations under which respondents were charged, and both the County Court of Erie County and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.  65 N.Y.2d 566, 483 N.E.2d 1120 (1985).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in the instant case and the decisions in <em>Sequoia Books, Inc. v. McDonald,</em> 725 F.2d 1091 (CA7 1984), and <em>United States v. Pryba,</em> 163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 502 F.2d 391 (1974), <em>cert. denied,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/1127/case.html">419 U. S. 1127</a></span> (1975). 474 U.S. 918 (1985).  We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>The obscenity charges against respondents arose out of an investigation by the Erie County District Attorney\'s Office.  Investigator David J. Groblewski was assigned to review 10 videocassette movies that had been rented from respondents\' store by a member of the Erie County Sheriff\'s Department. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Groblewski viewed the movies in their entirety, and executed affidavits summarizing the theme of, and conduct depicted in, each film.  The affidavits were attached to an application filed by the village of Depew Police Department for a warrant to search respondents\' store.</p>\n<p>A justice of the New York Supreme Court issued the warrant, authorizing the search of the store and the seizure of the movies.  The warrant was executed the next day and, according to a sworn, itemized inventory statement, the police seized 1 or 2 copies of each of the 10 movies.  A total of 13 videocassettes were seized.  The justice who had issued the warrant ordered that the videocassettes be temporarily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="871">Page 475 U. S. 871</a></p><p> retained by the police as evidence for trial.  <em>See</em> N.Y.Crim.Proc.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 690.05-690.55 (McKinney 1984).</p>\n<p>Respondents ultimately were charged in the village of Depew Justice Court with violating the New York obscenity laws with respect to only 5 of the 10 movies.  The affidavits describing these five movies appear in full in the <l=|475 868app|="" u.s.="">Appendix to this opinion. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Respondents moved for suppression of the seized videocassettes, alleging that the warrant authorizing their seizure was not supported by probable cause because the issuing justice had not personally viewed the movies.  The Justice Court granted the motion and dismissed the informations under which respondents were charged, and on the State\'s appeal the County Court of Erie County affirmed.</l=|475></p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals likewise affirmed, although on a different theory than that of the Justice Court.  According to the Court of Appeals,</p>\n<p>"there is a higher standard for evaluation of a warrant application seeking to seize such things as books and films, as distinguished from one seeking to seize weapons or drugs, for example (<em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/413/496/case.html">Roaden v. Kentucky,</a></span></em> [413 U.S. 496],  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/413/496/case.html#504">413 U. S. 504</a></span> [1973]; <em>Marcus v.

S. 730</a></span>-731 [1961]).  In applying the [Fourth] Amendment to such items, the court must act with \'scrupulous exactitude\' (<em>Stanford v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/379/476/case.html">379 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/379/476/case.html#481">379 U.

Using this "higher" probable cause standard to review the affidavits submitted in support of the warrant application, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p>"Many of the scenes described contain explicit sexual activity, patently offensive by any constitutional standard, but the allegations of the affidavits do not indicate whether they constitute all, most or a few of the scenes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="872">Page 475 U. S. 872</a></p><p> presented in the films. . . .  The descriptions of the action are not supplemented by references to the narrative or dialogue of the films and the affiant attempted to describe the \'character\' or \'theme\' of the movies by settings having nothing to do with the plot. . . .  He made no attempt to reveal the story line (or lack of one) of the films or demonstrate that their \'predominant appeal\' was to prurient interest.  In short, none of the affidavits permit an inference that the scenes described are more than a catalog of offensive parts of the whole."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 570-571, 483 N.E.2d at 1124.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the affidavits did not contain sufficient information to permit the issuing justice,</p>\n<p>"applying contemporary community standards, to judge the films as a whole and determine that they are within the statutory definitions of obscenity, and thus are not entitled to constitutional protection."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 572, 483 N.E.2d at 1124 (footnote omitted).  One judge dissented, arguing that the affidavits contained enough information for the issuing justice "to reasonably believe that the video movies were obscene as legislatively defined."  <em>Id.</em> at 573, 483 N.E.2d at 1125 (Jasen, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="873">Page 475 U. S. 873</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We have long recognized that the seizure of films or books on the basis of their content implicates First Amendment concerns not raised by other kinds of seizures.  For this reason, we have required that certain special conditions be met before such seizures may be carried out.  In <em>Roaden v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/496/case.html">413 U. S. 496</a></span> (1973), for example, we held that the police may not rely on the "exigency" exception to the Fourth Amendment\'s warrant requirement in conducting a seizure of allegedly obscene materials, under circumstances where such a seizure would effectively constitute a "prior restraint."  <em>In A Quantity of Books v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/205/case.html">378 U. S. 205</a></span> (1964), and <em>Marcus v. Search Warrant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/717/case.html">367 U. S. 717</a></span> (1961), we had gone a step farther, ruling that the large-scale seizure of books or films constituting a "prior restraint" must be preceded by an adversary hearing on the question of obscenity.  In <em>Heller v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html">413 U. S. 483</a></span> (1973), we emphasized that, even where a seizure of allegedly obscene materials would not constitute a "prior restraint," but instead would merely preserve evidence for trial, the seizure must be made pursuant to a warrant and there must be an opportunity for a prompt postseizure judicial determination of obscenity.  And in <em>Lee Art Theatre, Inc. v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/636/case.html">392 U. S. 636</a></span> (1968), we held that a warrant authorizing the seizure of materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment may not issue based solely on the conclusory allegations of a police officer that the sought-after materials are obscene, but instead must be supported by affidavits setting forth specific facts in order </p><p><a class="page-number" name="874">Page 475 U. S. 874</a></p><p> that the issuing magistrate may "focus searchingly on the question of obscenity."  <em>Marcus, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/717/case.html#732">367 U. S. 732</a></span>; <em>see also Stanford v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/case.html">379 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/case.html#486">379 U. S. 486</a></span> (1965). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals construed our prior decisions in this area as standing for the additional proposition that an application for a warrant authorizing the seizure of books or films must be evaluated under a "higher" standard of probable cause than that used in other areas of Fourth Amendment law.  But we have never held or said that such a "higher" standard is required by the First Amendment.  In <em>Heller,</em> we said:</p>\n<p>"[S]eizing films to destroy them or to block their distribution or exhibition is a very different matter from seizing a single copy of a film for the <em>bona fide</em> purpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding, particularly where, as here, there is no showing or pretrial claim that the seizure of the copy prevented continuing exhibition of the film.  If such a seizure is pursuant to a warrant, <em>issued after a determination of probable cause by a neutral magistrate,</em> and, following the seizure, a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding is available at the request of any interested party, the seizure is constitutionally permissible. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>The necessity for a prior judicial determination of probable cause</em> will protect against gross abuses. . . ."</p>\n<p>413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html#492">413 U. S. 492</a></span>-493 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="875">Page 475 U. S. 875</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We think that this passage from <em>Heller,</em> emphasizing the requirement that the magistrate determine probable cause as a means of safeguarding First Amendment interests, and eschewing any suggestion that the standard of probable cause in the First Amendment area is different than in other contexts, suggests that we saw no need for the latter requirement.  In our view, the longstanding special protections described above, and enunciated in cases such as <em>Roaden, A Quantity of Books, Marcus, Heller,</em> and <em>Lee Art Theatre,</em> are adequate to ensure that First Amendment interests will not be impaired by the issuance and execution of warrant authorizing the seizure of books or films.  We think, and accordingly hold, that an application for a warrant authorizing the seizure of materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment should be evaluated under the same standard of probable cause used to review warrant applications generally.

Applying the <em>Gates</em> standard to the affidavits in the instant case, we think it clear beyond peradventure that the warrant was supported by probable cause to believe that the five films at issue were obscene under New York law.  Respondents concede that the affidavits describing the five films adequately established probable cause with respect to the second of the three elements of obscenity under the statute, namely, that the movies depicted "in a patently offensive manner" the various kinds of sexual conduct specified in the statute.  <em>See</em> N.Y. Penal Law \xc2\xa7 235.00(1)(b) (McKinney 1980).  Our review of the affidavits convinces us that the issuing justice also was given more than enough information to conclude that there was a "fair probability" that the movies satisfied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="877">Page 475 U. S. 877</a></p><p> the first and third elements of the statutory definition, namely, that the "predominant appeal [of the movies] is to the prurient interest in sex," and that the movies "lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value."  <em>See</em> N.Y. Penal Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 235.00(1)(a), (c) (McKinney 1980).  As Judge Jasen of the Court of Appeals noted in his dissent in the present case:</p>\n<p>"Each of the affidavits describing the films clearly state at the outset that \'the <em>content</em> and character of the above mentioned video movie is as follows.\'  Inasmuch as the magistrate was reviewing affidavits describing movies which were advertised by defendants as \'adult cassette movies,\' it was reasonable for him to believe that the affidavits faithfully and accurately described the substance of each movie as a whole.  Each affidavit describes the numerous acts of deviate sexual intercourse and the objectification of women occurring in each film which the majority concede to be offensive.  Each film is of relatively short duration.  Manifestly, the acts described in each movie consume a substantial timespan.  Thus, the magistrate may reasonably have concluded that the described, successive acts of deviate sexual intercourse pervaded each film.  When the title of each movie is considered together with its plot and setting, its general theme and serious value, if any, may reasonably be discerned.  The films were described in each of the five nonconclusory affidavits in such a fashion as to permit the magistrate to focus searchingly on the issue of obscenity.  Under these circumstances, there was a reasonable basis for the magistrate to authorize the seizure of the films in question."</p>\n<p>65 N.Y.2d at 580, 483 N.E.2d at 1130 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>We believe that the analysis and conclusion expressed by the dissenting judge are completely consistent with our statement in <em>Gates</em> that "probable cause requires only a probability </p><p><a class="page-number" name="878">Page 475 U. S. 878</a></p><p> or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity."  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#244">462 U.

We hold that, evaluated under the correct standard of probable cause, the warrant was properly issued, and the videocassettes of the five movies should not have been suppressed.  The judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>|475 U.S. 868app|</p>\n<p><em>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT\n</em></p>\n<p><em><em>AFFIDAVIT</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>STATE OF NEW YORK )</p>\n<p>COUNTY OF ERIE    ) SS:</p>\n<p>CITY OF BUFFALO   )</p>\n<p>DAVID J.

The second scene is another house scene where a white male and white female are giving a rubdown to a white female.  The sexual acts that follow include cunnilingus and fellatio.  There is also intercourse and the scene closes with the male placing his penis between the girl\'s breasts and ejaculating into and over her mouth.  In another scene there is some incestuous type activity between the brother and the sister where again fellatio and intercourse are performed.  At one point during the movie the mother enters the bedroom and observes the two performing the sexual acts and becomes depressed about the situation.  In a later scene the son and his mother are on a couch where they become involved in sexual acts of intercourse and fellatio.  The movie closes with the mother and father asleep in their bedroom at which time the daughter enters and sleeps next to her father, where they perform incestuous acts of intercourse, and she performs fellatio on her father.</p>\n<p>[Signature]</p>\n<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me</p>\n<p>this [21] day of November, 1983</p>\n<p>[Signature]</p>\n<p>Notary Public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="881">Page 475 U.

Here, the New York Court of Appeals cited the New York Constitution only once, near the beginning of its opinion, and in the same parenthetical also cited the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the "First Amendment" and "Fourth Amendment" during its discussion of the merits of the case, strongly indicating that it believed that its decision was governed by federal law.  Finally, although the Court of Appeals cited several state court decisions, the only citations appended to the crucial language quoted in the text were to the federal decisions in <em>Roaden v.

On the contrary, we think that a reasonably specific affidavit describing the content of a film generally provides an adequate basis for the magistrate to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the film is obscene, and whether a warrant authorizing the seizure of the film should issue.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents contend that the seizure in the instant case was not limited to only one copy of each film, but instead extended to all copies of the films that the police were able to find during their search of respondents\' store.  According to respondents, the seizure had the effect of severely restricting public access to the films, and thereby constituted a "prior restraint."  Respondents therefore argue that this case is properly governed not by <em>Heller v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html">413 U.

Our reference in <em>Roaden</em> to a "higher hurdle . . . of reasonableness" was not intended to establish a "higher" standard of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to seize books or films, but instead related to the more basic requirement, imposed by that decision, that the police not rely on the "exigency" exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, but instead obtain a warrant from a magistrate who has "<em>focus[ed] searchingly on the question of obscenity.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/496/case.html#506">413 U.

N.Y. Penal Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 235.00(1)(a), (c) (McKinney 1980).  The question before this Court is whether three New York state courts erred in holding that the affidavits at issue in this case failed to establish probable cause that those standards were met. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The determination of what the standards of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="885">Page 475 U. S. 885</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 235.00(1) mean and how they should be applied in individual cases, of course, is, in the first instance, a matter of state law and the rightful province of the state courts.  While the majority describes it as "clear beyond peradventure," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/868/case.html#876">475 U.

The court, per Justice Wick, noted that the issuing Magistrate had apparently not himself viewed the films, and that the retired state trooper who compiled the affidavits had "obviously paid no attention to contemporary community standards" and "made no further determination if the presentations had any literary, artistic, political or scientific value."  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-37.  Without stating clearly the exact basis of its decision, the court noted that</p>\n<p>"[t]he material contained [in the films] may be of the type proscribed by Section 235.05 of the Penal Law, but, equally, it may be . . . \'coarse, puerile, offensive and distasteful (and still not) obscene under the law or proscribable.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at A-38, quoting <em>People v. Stabile,</em> 58 Misc.2d 905, 296 N.Y.S.2d 815 (N.Y.C.Crim.Ct.1969).  The court granted respondents\' suppression motion.</p>\n<p>The Erie County Court affirmed.  Justice LaMendola noted the absence of a transcript of the proceedings, if any, before the issuing Magistrate, and declared it within the lower court\'s discretion to hold that,</p>\n<p>"under New York law, the issuing magistrate had failed to make an adequate finding of probable cause . . . because he relied solely on the affidavits of the police officers, without any further investigation or viewing of the materials to be confiscated."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="886">Page 475 U. S. 886</a></p><p> for Cert. A-33.  Justice LaMendola\'s reference to "further investigation or viewing" makes it plain that she did not regard the issuing Magistrate\'s viewing of the film as an invariable requisite to issuance of a warrant.  The affidavits in this case, however, unsupported by further investigation, provided insufficient basis for a warrant authorization.</p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals affirmed.  65 N.Y.2d 566, 483 N.E.2d 1120 (1985).  The court recognized that</p>\n<p>"the task of the issuing magistrate was not to decide guilt or innocence, but to determine in a preliminary way from the information submitted and available to him whether there was probable cause to believe that the material to be seized was obscene within the tripartite definition of the statute."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 570, 483 N.E.2d at 1123.  Applying that standard, it held the affidavits insufficient.</p>\n<p>Near the beginning of its opinion, the New York court reiterated this Court\'s recent direction that the Fourth Amendment be applied with "<em>scrupulous exactitude\'" in cases of searches for and seizures of presumptively protected materials, <em>Maryland v. Macon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/463/case.html">472 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/463/case.html#468">472 U. S. 468</a></span> (1985); <em>see also Stanford v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/case.html">379 U. S. 476</a></span> (1965), and noted a "higher standard" for warrant determinations when books and films are seized, citing <em>Roaden v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/496/case.html">413 U. S. 496</a></span> (1973).  The New York court did not go on, however, to apply any extraordinary standard of scrutiny to the determination of probable cause.  Rather, its holding was a simple one:\n</em></p>\n<p>"There must be enough information before [the issuing magistrate] in one form or other . . . to enable him to judge the obscenity of the film, not of isolated scenes from it."</p>\n<p>65 N.Y.2d at 571, 483 N.E.2d at 1124.  The affidavits, the court explained, merely cataloged offensive sex acts depicted in the films.  Such catalogs say nothing about the "predominant appeal" of a film, its impact "considered as a whole," or its overall literary or artistic value.</p>\n<p>"Undoubtedly, similar lists could readily be compiled by excerpting descriptions of scenes from books and movies having recognized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="887">Page 475 U. S. 887</a></p><p> merit.  Stanley Kubrick\'s \'Clockwork Orange\' and Federico Fellini\'s \'Satyricon\' come quickly to mind."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Because obscenity law requires examination of the films as a whole, the court held, probable cause cannot be inferred from the description of a few excerpted scenes.  <em>Id.</em> at 572, 483 N.E.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Taken in the abstract, the New York court\'s reasoning is unassailable.  A mere listing of sex acts depicted in a film, or a description of excerpted scenes, says little about the predominant effect of the film considered as a whole.  It says nothing about whether the film, considered as a whole, has any artistic value.  And it says nothing about how the film should be regarded in light of contemporary community standards.  Such a description, then, cannot establish even probable cause to believe that the film is obscene.  "[S]ex and obscenity are not synonymous."  <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#487">354 U. S. 487</a></span> (1957). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  A magistrate armed only with such a description cannot "<em>focus searchingly on the question of obscenity,\'" as the majority, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/868/case.html#874">475 U. S. 874</a></span>, concedes he is obligated to do.\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority\'s rejection of the New York court\'s reasoning appears to derive from a largely unarticulated feeling that that reasoning is inappropriately applied in the present case.  As a result, notwithstanding the sweeping legal principles set out in the majority\'s opinion, the decision of this case ultimately rests on the mundane application of clear law to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="888">Page 475 U. S. 888</a></p><p> undisputed facts.  The majority suggests that the New York court wrongly applied its law because the affidavits described more than excerpted scenes:  they allowed the Magistrate to discern the "<em>general theme and serious value\'" of the films, and established that sex acts "`pervaded\'" each film.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/868/case.html#877">475 U. S. 877</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>The problem with the majority\'s approach is that it is unsupported in the texts of the affidavits.  Although a boilerplate sentence in each affidavit invokes the "content" of the films, and two of the affidavits conclusorily assert that certain sex acts are depicted "throughout" the film, the affidavits do not attempt to describe every scene in the films, or even most of the scenes.  Rather, the scenes described in the affidavits are simply those the author chose to describe.  While descriptions of sex acts pervade the <em>affidavits,</em> it is hardly clear that depictions of sex acts pervade the <em>films.</em>  Similarly, while the "general tone" of the affidavits is clear, we have little basis for a conclusion about the "general tone" of the films.</p>\n<p>The affidavits do not purport to be exhaustive.  They can be meaningful in considering the artistic value of the films, taken as a whole, or the films\' predominant appeal, only if one assumes that everything, or almost everything, worth noting in the films was incorporated into the affidavits.  Nothing in the affidavits, however, justifies that assumption.  The affidavits are precisely what the New York Court of Appeals condemned:  mere listings of selected scenes from the films that involved depictions of sex.  The films described could as well be "Last Tango in Paris."</p>\n<p>The majority\'s decision upholding a warrant authorization uninformed by any information relating to crucial elements of the definition of obscenity is especially incongruous because the majority overrules the institution most closely attuned to the content of those elements:  the New York courts.  The New York courts are well suited to decide whether, on the basis of "contemporary community standards," the information </p><p><a class="page-number" name="889">Page 475 U. S. 889</a></p><p> supporting a warrant authorization allows the magistrate to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity, and to find probable cause that given material is obscene.  The New York courts have unanimously held in this case that the affidavits were insufficient to achieve that end.  The majority\'s eagerness to reverse that fact-bound determination in order to expedite an obscenity prosecution is inappropriate, and reflects a dubious notion of this Court\'s institutional role.  <em>Cf. California v. Carney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/386/case.html">471 U.
