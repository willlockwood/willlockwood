Ross</b></p><p><b>52 U.S. (11 How.) 362</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>In some of the states, it is the practice, after the evidence for the plaintiff is closed, for the defendant to pray the court to instruct the jury that there is no evidence upon which they can find a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>This is equivalent to a demurrer to the evidence, and such an instruction ought to be given whenever the evidence is not legally sufficient to serve as a foundation of a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>Where the United States and the Cherokee nation agreed that the latter should emigrate across the Mississippi, and the former pay the expenses thereof, and the Cherokees undertook to conduct the movement entirely by their own agents, a person whose wagons had been hired could not hold the agent who had hired them personally responsible.  The owner of the wagons knew that the agent was a public officer, and dealt with him as such.</p>\n<p>Wherever a contract or engagement, made by a public officer, is connected with a subject fairly within the scope of his authority, it shall be considered to have been made officially and in his public character, unless the contrary appears by satisfactory evidence of an absolute and unqualified engagement to be personally liable.</p>\n<p>This was an action brought by Parks for services rendered by Samuel Parks to John Ross in the removal of the Cherokee nation to the western side of the Mississippi in the years 1838 and 1839.  The bills of exception set forth <em>in extenso</em> all the evidence offered by the plaintiff upon the trial.  Some of this evidence consisted of long documents, which it is not deemed necessary to insert, although they were made parts of the bills of exceptions.  Their contents will be sufficiently understood from the following narrative.</p>\n<p>In the year 1838, the government of the United States was desirous to remove the Cherokee nation to their assigned habitation beyond the Mississippi River, and deputed General Scott to make an arrangement with them for that purpose.  The Cherokees, upon their part, appointed an agent with plenary powers, as appears from the following preamble to some resolutions adopted by them in 1840:</p>\n<p>"And whereas, these conditions being fully settled, the special agents of the nation, acting on the nation\'s behalf, after having made divers appointments for the purpose of carrying it into effect, in order to condense the business, did delegate its entire superintendence to one of their body, John Ross, and by John Ross such persons were deputed for the management of the various departments on account of the nation as were considered best qualified for the purpose,"</p>\n<p>&amp;c.</p>\n<p>In order to ascertain the probable expense and amount of drafts necessary to be drawn upon the Treasury, General Scott caused the following estimate to be made out. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 52 U.

The declaration contained the common money counts.  In March, 1848, the cause came on for trial, when the jury, under the instructions of the court, found a verdict for the defendant.  Upon the trial, the defendant took two bills of exception to the admission of evidence, which were not argued in this Court in the posture of the case, and which would not be inserted in this report except that the plaintiff\'s bill of exceptions adopts them, and refers to the recapitulation of evidence contained therein.</p>\n<p>"Before the jurors aforesaid retired from the bar of the Court here, the said plaintiff, by his attorney aforesaid, filed in court here the following bills of exceptions, to-wit:"</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Defendant\'s First Bill of Exceptions</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"<em>GEORGE W.

John Ross had a general order and power to pay the claims arising out of the emigration; he received the money and paid it out.  Several years ago, he paid over to the Cherokee nation $125,000, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 52 U. S. 367</a></p><p> which had been saved from the expenses of the emigration, and being asked by the plaintiff what had become of the $180,000 received, he replied:"</p>\n<p>"Just before I left home to come to the United States, Mr. Ross made a final settlement with the nation of all the money received by him for the emigration; being asked by plaintiff, he says it was in writing, and plaintiff insists his answer is not evidence.  He states that he is one of the executive council of the nation, and now a delegate from the nation to the United States."</p>\n<p>"Being cross-examined he says:"</p>\n<p>"The only power Mr. Ross had to pay claims was to pay such claims as had been passed by the committee or delegates; that he does not know out of what found Mr. Ross could have saved the $125,000, except the money received for return wagons; that no money ever was paid to any person, nor any claim ever presented by any person to the committee or delegates, for \'return wagon money\'; that the witness himself made the contract with the plaintiff\'s intestate for the hire of his wagons, and no contract was made for, and no reference made to, any return wagons, for it was understood they were all to remain in the nation; that plaintiff\'s intestate married the sister of witness, and was a citizen of the Cherokee nation; that he sold and disposed of his wagons and teams in the Cherokee nation, except one, with which he returned to the State of Tennessee, for the purpose, as he stated to witness, of bringing out his family; he did not return, but died in Tennessee, and he never in his lifetime to witness, or with his knowledge, set up any claim for return wagons; and witness was present when the account of plaintiff\'s intestate was settled, and afterwards, when the full balance was paid to the plaintiff; that there were various incidental expenses not estimated for originally, but which had to be paid by the nation, growing out of the delays and other causes in the emigration; that they were paid by the nation, and witness does not know out of what fund they could have been paid except out of the return wagon money, and witness believes from the facts he has stated that the money so paid over by Ross to the nation, and the incidental expenses of the emigration, were paid out of that fund."</p>\n<p>"And thereupon, and after the testimony of the said Richard Taylor had been given, the plaintiff further offered to read in evidence from a certain printed document, purporting to be Senate Document 298, 1st Session 29th Congress, two certain papers as follows, marked B and C, copied in record, and to lay a foundation therefor gave to the court the following evidence of Burke and J. R. Rogers, copied in record, and the defendant objected to the admissibility of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 52 U.

The declaration contained the common money counts.  In March, 1848, the cause came on for trial, when the jury, under the instructions of the court, found a verdict for the defendant.

John Ross had a general order and power to pay the claims arising out of the emigration; he received the money and paid it out.  Several years ago, he paid over to the Cherokee nation $125,000, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 52 U.

He states that he is one of the executive council of the nation, and now a delegate from the nation to the United States."</p>\n<p>"Being cross-examined he says:"</p>\n<p>"The only power Mr. Ross had to pay claims was to pay such claims as had been passed by the committee or delegates; that he does not know out of what found Mr. Ross could have saved the $125,000, except the money received for return wagons; that no money ever was paid to any person, nor any claim ever presented by any person to the committee or delegates, for \'return wagon money\'; that the witness himself made the contract with the plaintiff\'s intestate for the hire of his wagons, and no contract was made for, and no reference made to, any return wagons, for it was understood they were all to remain in the nation; that plaintiff\'s intestate married the sister of witness, and was a citizen of the Cherokee nation; that he sold and disposed of his wagons and teams in the Cherokee nation, except one, with which he returned to the State of Tennessee, for the purpose, as he stated to witness, of bringing out his family; he did not return, but died in Tennessee, and he never in his lifetime to witness, or with his knowledge, set up any claim for return wagons; and witness was present when the account of plaintiff\'s intestate was settled, and afterwards, when the full balance was paid to the plaintiff; that there were various incidental expenses not estimated for originally, but which had to be paid by the nation, growing out of the delays and other causes in the emigration; that they were paid by the nation, and witness does not know out of what fund they could have been paid except out of the return wagon money, and witness believes from the facts he has stated that the money so paid over by Ross to the nation, and the incidental expenses of the emigration, were paid out of that fund."</p>\n<p>"And thereupon, and after the testimony of the said Richard Taylor had been given, the plaintiff further offered to read in evidence from a certain printed document, purporting to be Senate Document 298, 1st Session 29th Congress, two certain papers as follows, marked B and C, copied in record, and to lay a foundation therefor gave to the court the following evidence of Burke and J.

S. 372</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRIER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On the trial of this cause below, after the plaintiff had closed his testimony, the defendant\'s counsel requested the court to instruct the jury, "that if the evidence is believed by the jury to be true, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover."  This instruction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 52 U. S. 373</a></p><p> was given by the court, and excepted to by plaintiff.  Its correctness is the question for our decision.</p>\n<p>It is undoubtedly the peculiar province of the jury to find all matters of fact and of the court to decide all questions of law arising thereon.  But a jury has no right to assume the truth of any material fact without some evidence legally sufficient to establish it.  It is therefore error in the court to instruct the jury that they may find a material fact of which there is no evidence from which it may be legally inferred.</p>\n<p>Hence the practice of granting an instruction like the present, which makes it imperative upon the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, and which has in many states superseded the ancient practice of a demurrer to evidence.  It answers the same purpose, and should be tested by the same rules.  A demurrer to evidence admits not only the facts stated therein, but also every conclusion which a jury might fairly or reasonably infer therefrom.</p>\n<p>The question for our consideration is therefore whether the evidence submitted by the plaintiff in this case was sufficient to authorize the jury in finding any contract or undertaking, either express or implied, on the part of John Ross, the defendant, to pay the money demanded in the declaration.</p>\n<p>A brief summary of the admitted facts of the case will, we think, sufficiently demonstrate the correctness of the instruction given by the court below, and that if the defendant had demurred to the evidence in form, he would have been entitled to the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff\'s intestate was a citizen of the Cherokee nation.  In 1838, a large portion of this nation, of which John Ross was the principal chief, had consented to emigrate to the west of the Mississippi River.  The Cherokees were permitted to conduct their emigration by their own agents, the expense thereof to be advanced by the United States out of certain moneys or money due to the Cherokees by a former treaty.  They accordingly appointed certain persons of their own nation as delegates or special agents to act in behalf of the nation.  Of this agency John Ross was the chief, and acted as general superintendent.  As such, he received large sums of money from the Treasury of the United States for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the emigration, on estimates approved by General Scott.  Among these estimates was one for hire of fifty-one wagons and teams, amounting in the whole to $51,000.  In this amount was included an item of $14,280, as necessary to pay the hire and expenses of the wagons on their return at the rate of seven dollars per day.  The plaintiff\'s intestate was owner of four of the fifty-one wagons and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 52 U. S. 374</a></p><p> teams employed.  After the emigration was ended, the delegates or agents of the nation settled the accounts, and among others that of plaintiff\'s intestate, who received the amount of his account and gave a receipt in full.  Nothing was allowed him for return wagon hire in the account settled, and none was claimed by him, as he was himself a Cherokee, and intended to reside in the nation.  Since his death, this suit has been instituted by his administrator on the mistaken notion that, because in the money of the nation received by John Ross there was included a sum of $14,280 estimated as necessary to pay return wagon hire, therefore the plaintiff\'s intestate was entitled to his proportional share of it, without any regard to the fact whether the Cherokees were willing to allow it to him or whether it was due to him on his own contract with their agents.  There was no evidence whatever tending to show a special contract by John Ross personally to pay for the teams and wagons, either for going or returning.  The contract of plaintiff\'s intestate was with the Cherokee nation, through their known public agents or officers.  John Ross was the superintendent, treasurer, and disbursing officer.  The money in his possession was the money of the nation; the plaintiff\'s intestate, and all who were employed in assisting the nation to emigrate, were fully aware that John Ross was acting as a public officer, and dealt with him as such.</p>\n<p>Now it is an established rule of law that an agent who contracts in the name of his principal is not liable to suit on such contract, much less a public officer, acting for his government.  As regards him, the rule is that he is not responsible on any contract he may make in that capacity, and wherever his contract or engagement is connected with a subject fairly within the scope of his authority, it shall be intended to have been made officially and in his public character, unless the contrary appears by satisfactory evidence of an absolute and unqualified engagement to be personally liable.</p>\n<p>The Cherokees are in many respects a foreign and independent nation.  They are governed by their own laws and officers, chosen by themselves.  And though in a state of pupilage and under the guardianship of the United States, this government has delegated no power to the courts of this district to arrest the public representatives or agents of Indian nations who may be casually within their local jurisdiction and compel them to pay the debts of their nation, either to an individual of their own nation, or a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the circuit court is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 52 U. S. 375</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Washington and was argued by counsel.
