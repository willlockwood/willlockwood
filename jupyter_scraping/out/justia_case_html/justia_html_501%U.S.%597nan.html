Among other things, the 1972 amendments significantly strengthened the preexisting registration and labeling standards, specified that FIFRA regulates pesticide use, as well as sales and labeling, and granted increased enforcement authority to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Regarding state and local authorities, FIFRA, as amended, includes provisions requiring pesticide manufacturers to produce records for inspection "upon request of any officer or employee . . . of any State or political subdivision," \xc2\xa7 136f(b); directing the EPA to cooperate with "any appropriate agency of any state or any political subdivision thereof . . . in securing uniformity of regulations," \xc2\xa7 136t(b); and specifying that "[a] State" may regulate pesticide sale or use so long as such regulation does not permit a sale or use prohibited by the Act, \xc2\xa7 136v(a).  Pursuant to its statutory police power, petitioner town adopted an ordinance that, <em>inter alia,</em> requires a permit for certain applications of pesticides to private lands.  After the town issued a decision unfavorable to respondent Mortier on his application for a permit to spray a portion of his land, he brought a declaratory judgment action in county court, claiming, among other things, that the ordinance was preempted by FIFRA.  The court granted summary judgment for Mortier, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, finding preemption on the ground that the Act\'s text and legislative history demonstrate a clearly manifest congressional intent to prohibit any regulation of pesticides by local governmental units.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  FIFRA does not preempt local governmental regulation of pesticide use.

Neither the Act\'s language nor the legislative history relied on by the court below, whether read together or separately, suffices to establish preemption.  The fact that \xc2\xa7 136v(a) expressly refers only to "[a] State" as having the authority to regulate pesticide use, and the Act\'s failure to include political subdivisions in its \xc2\xa7 136(aa) definition of "State," are wholly inadequate to demonstrate the requisite clear and manifest congressional intent.  Mere silence is insufficient in this context.  <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U.

And the exclusion of local governments cannot be inferred from the express authorization to "State[s]," because that term is not self-limiting; political subdivisions are merely subordinate components of the very entity the statute empowers.  <em>Cf., e.g., Sailors v.

Indeed, the more plausible reading of the express authorization leaves the allocation of regulatory authority to the absolute discretion of the States themselves, including the options of specific redelegation or leaving local regulation of pesticides in the hands of local authorities under existing state laws.  Nor is there any merit to Mortier\'s contention that the express references in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 136t(b) and 136f(b) to "political subdivision[s]" show that Congress made a clear distinction between nonregulatory authority, which may be exercised by such subdivisions, and the regulatory authority reserved to the "State[s]" in \xc2\xa7 136v(a).  Furthermore, the legislative history is, at best, ambiguous, reflecting a disagreement between the responsible congressional committees as to whether the provision that would become \xc2\xa7 136v preempted local regulation.

The argument that the 1972 amendments transformed the Act into a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="599">Page 501 U.

Section 136v itself undercuts any inference of field preemption, since \xc2\xa7 136v(b) prohibits States from enacting or imposing labeling or packaging requirements that conflict with those required under FIFRA.  This language would be pure surplusage if Congress had already occupied the entire field.  Nor does FIFRA otherwise imply preemption.  While the 1972 amendments turned the Act into a comprehensive regulatory statute, substantial portions of the field are still left vacant, including the area at issue in this case.  FIFRA nowhere seeks to establish an affirmative permit scheme for the actual use of pesticides or to occupy the field of local use permitting.  Thus, the specific grant of authority in \xc2\xa7 136v(a) must be read not as an exclusion of municipalities, but as an act ensuring that the States could continue to regulate use and sales even where, such as with regard to the banning of mislabeled products, a narrow preemptive overlap might occur.

Compliance with both the ordinance and FIFRA is not a physical impossibility.  Moreover, Mortier\'s assertions that the ordinance stands as an obstacle to the Act\'s goals of promoting pesticide regulation that is coordinated solely at the federal and state levels, that rests upon some degree of technical expertise, and that does not unduly burden interstate commerce are based on little more than snippets of legislative history and policy speculations, and are unpersuasive.  As is evidenced by \xc2\xa7 136t(b), FIFRA implies a regulatory partnership between federal, state, <em>and</em> local governments.  There is no indication that any coordination which the statute seeks to promote extends beyond the matters with which it expressly deals, or does so strongly enough to compel the conclusion that an independently enacted ordinance that falls outside the statute\'s reach frustrates its purpose.  Nor is there any indication in FIFRA that Congress felt that local ordinances necessarily rest on insufficient expertise and burden commerce.

The ordinance expressly borrows statutory definitions from both Wisconsin laws and FIFRA, and was enacted under Wis.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 61.34(1), (5) (1989-1990), which accords village boards with general police, health, and taxing powers.

Declining to address the issue of state law preemption, the court concluded that FIFRA preempted the town of Casey\'s ordinance because the statute\'s text and legislative history demonstrated a clearly manifest congressional intent to prohibit "any regulation of pesticides by local units of government."  <em>Id.</em> at 20, n. 2, and 30, 452 N.W.2d at 555, n. 2, 560.

The court, however, purported to find statutory language "which is indicative" of preemptive intent in the statute\'s provision delineating the "Authority of States."  7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136v.  The key portions of that provision state:</p>\n<p>"(a) . . . A State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this subchapter."</p>\n<p>"(b) . . . Such State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter."</p>\n<p>Also significant, in the court\'s eyes, was FIFRA\'s failure to specify political subdivisions in defining "State" as</p>\n<p>"a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and American Samoa."</p>\n<p>7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136(aa).</p>\n<p>It is not clear to the State Supreme Court, however,</p>\n<p>"that the statutory language [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 136v and 136(aa)] alone evince[d] congress\' manifest intent to deprive political subdivisions of authority to regulate pesticides."</p>\n<p><em>Casey,</em> 154 Wis.2d at 25, 452 N.W.2d at 557-558.  It was nevertheless "possible" to infer from the statutory language alone that pesticide regulation by local entities was preempted; and, when coupled with its legislative history, that language "unmistakably demonstrates the intent of Congress to preempt local ordinances such as that adopted by the Town of Casey."  <em>Id.</em> at 28, 452 N.W.2d at 559.  The court\'s holding thus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="607">Page 501 U. S. 607</a></p><p> rested on both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 136v and 136(aa) and their legislative history; neither the language nor the legislative history would have sufficed alone.  There was no suggestion that, absent the two critical sections, FIFRA was a sufficiently comprehensive statute to justify an inference that Congress had occupied the field to the exclusion of the States.  Nor have the respondents argued in this Court to that effect.  On the other hand, it is sufficiently clear that, under the opinion announced by the court below, the State would have been precluded from permitting local authorities to regulate pesticides.</p>\n<p>We agree that neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history, standing alone, would suffice to preempt local regulation.  But it is also our view that, even when considered together, the language and the legislative materials relied on below are insufficient to demonstrate the necessary congressional intent to preempt.  As for the statutory language, it is wholly inadequate to convey an express preemptive intent on its own.  Section 136v plainly authorizes the "States" to regulate pesticides, and just as plainly is silent with reference to local governments.  Mere silence, in this context, cannot suffice to establish a "clear and manifest purpose" to preempt local authority.  <em>Rice,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span>.  Even if FIFRA\'s express grant of regulatory authority to the States could not be read as applying to municipalities, it would not follow that municipalities were left with no regulatory authority.  Rather, it would mean that localities could not claim the regulatory authority explicitly conferred upon the States that might otherwise have been preempted through actual conflicts with Federal law.  At a minimum, localities would still be free to regulate subject to the usual principles of preemption.</p>\n<p>Properly read, the statutory language tilts in favor of local regulation.  The principle is well settled that local</p>\n<p>""governmental units are <em>created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the State as may be </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="608">Page 501 U.

City of Pittsburgh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/207/161/case.html">207 U.

The exclusion of political subdivisions cannot be inferred from the express authorization to the "State[s]," because political subdivisions are components of the very entity the statute empowers.  Indeed, the more plausible reading of FIFRA\'s authorization to the States leaves the allocation of regulatory authority to the "absolute discretion" of the States themselves, including the option of leaving local regulation of pesticides in the hands of local authorities.</p>\n<p>Certainly no other textual basis for preemption exists.  Mortier, building upon the decision below, contends that other provisions show that Congress made a clear distinction between nonregulatory authority, which it delegated to the States or their political subdivisions, and regulatory authority, which it expressly delegated to the "State[s]" alone.  The provisions on which he relies, however, undercut his contention.  Section 136t(b), for example, mandates that the EPA Administrator cooperate with "any appropriate agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof, in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter."  As an initial matter, the section does not limit "the provisions of the subchapter" which localities are authorized to carry out to "nonregulatory" provisions.  Moreover, to read this provision as preempting localities would also require the anomalous result of preempting the actions of any agency to the extent it exercised state-delegated powers that included pesticide regulation.  Likewise, \xc2\xa7 136f(b) requires manufacturers to produce records for the inspection upon the request of any employee of the EPA "or of any State or political subdivision, duly designated by the Administrator."  Section 136u(a)(1), however, authorizes the Administrator to "delegate to any State . . . the authority to cooperate in the enforcement of this [Act] through the use of its personnel."  If the use of "State" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="609">Page 501 U. S. 609</a></p><p> in FIFRA impliedly excludes subdivisions, it is unclear why the one provision would allow the designation of local officials for enforcement purposes, while the other would prohibit local enforcement authority altogether.</p>\n<p>Mortier, like the court below and other courts that have found preemption, attempts to compensate for the statute\'s textual inadequacies by stressing the legislative history.  <em>Casey,</em> 154 Wis.2d at 25-28, 452 N.W.2d at 558-559; <em>Professional Lawn Care Association,</em> 909 F.2d at 933-934.  The evidence from this source, which centers on the meaning of what would become \xc2\xa7 136v, is, at best, ambiguous.  The House Agriculture Committee Report accompanying the proposed FIFRA amendments stated that it had</p>\n<p>"rejected a proposal which would have permitted political subdivisions to further regulate pesticides on the grounds that the 50 States and the Federal Government should provide an adequate number of regulatory jurisdictions."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, p. 16 (1971).  While this statement indicates an unwillingness by Congress to grant political subdivisions regulatory authority, it does not demonstrate an intent to prevent the States from delegating such authority to its subdivisions, and still less does it show a desire to prohibit local regulation altogether.  At least one other statement, however, concededly goes further.  The Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry Report states outright that it</p>\n<p>"considered the decision of the House Committee to deprive political subdivisions of States and other local authorities of any authority or jurisdiction over pesticides, and concurs with the decision of the House of Representatives."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-838, p. 16 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, pp. 3993, 4008.</p>\n<p>But other Members of Congress clearly disagreed.  The Senate Commerce Committee, which also had jurisdiction over the bill, observed that,</p>\n<p>"[w]hile the [Senate] Agriculture Committee bill does not specifically prohibit local governments from regulating pesticides, the report of that committee states explicitly that local governments cannot regulate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 501 U. S. 610</a></p><p> pesticides in any manner.  Many local governments now regulate pesticides to meet their own specific needs, which they are often better able to perceive than are State and Federal regulators."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-970, p. 27 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4111.  To counter the language in the Agriculture and Forestry Committee Report, the Commerce Committee proposed an amendment expressly authorizing local regulation among numerous other, unrelated proposals.  This amendment was rejected after negotiations between the two Committees.  <em>See</em> 118 Cong.Rec. 32251 (1972); H.R.Conf. Rep. No. 92-1540, p. 33 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 3993.</p>\n<p>As a result, matters were left with the two principal Committees responsible for the bill in disagreement over whether it preempted pesticide regulation by political subdivisions.  It is important to note, moreover, that even this disagreement was confined to the preemptive effect of FIFRA\'s authorization of regulatory power to the States in \xc2\xa7 136v.  None of the Committees mentioned asserted that FIFRA preempted the field of pesticide regulation.  Like FIFRA\'s text, the legislative history thus falls far short of establishing that preemption of local pesticide regulation was the "clear and manifest purpose of Congress."  <em>Rice,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span>.  We thus agree with the submission in the <em>amicus</em> brief of the United States expressing the views of the Environmental Protection Agency, the agency charged with enforcing FIFRA. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 501 U. S. 611</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Likewise, FIFRA fails to provide any clear and manifest indication that Congress sought to supplant local authority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 501 U. S. 612</a></p><p> over pesticide regulation impliedly.  In particular, we reject the position of some courts, but not the court below, that the 1972 amendments transformed FIFRA into a comprehensive statute that occupied the field of pesticide regulation, and that certain provisions opened specific portions of the field to state regulation and much smaller portions to local regulation.  <em>See Professional Lawn Care,</em> 909 F.2d at 933-934; <em>Maryland Pest Control,</em> 646 F.Supp. at 110-111; <em>see also,</em> Brief for National Pest Control Association <em>et al.</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6-16; Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18.  On this assumption, it has been argued, \xc2\xa7 136v(a) could be viewed as opening the field of general pesticide regulation to the States, yet leaving it closed to political subdivisions.</p>\n<p>This reasoning is unpersuasive.  As an initial matter, it would still have to be shown under ordinary canons of construction that FIFRA\'s delegation of authority to "State[s]" would not therefore allow the States in turn to redelegate some of this authority to their political subdivisions, either specifically or by leaving undisturbed their existing statutes that would otherwise provide local government with ample authority to regulate.  We have already noted that \xc2\xa7 136v(a) can be plausibly read to contemplate precisely such redelegation.  The term "State" is not self-limiting, since political subdivisions are merely subordinate components of the whole.  The scattered mention of political subdivisions elsewhere in FIFRA does not require their exclusion here.  The legislative history is complex and ambiguous.</p>\n<p>More importantly, field preemption cannot be inferred.  In the first place, \xc2\xa7 136v itself undercuts such an inference.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 501 U. S. 613</a></p><p> The provision immediately following the statute\'s grant of regulatory authority to the States declares that</p>\n<p>"[s]uch State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling and packaging in addition to or different from those required under"</p>\n<p>FIFRA. 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136v(b).  This language would be pure surplusage if Congress had intended to occupy the entire field of pesticide regulation.  Taking such preemption as the premise, \xc2\xa7 136v(a) would thus grant States the authority to regulate the "sale or use" of pesticides, while \xc2\xa7 136v(b) would superfluously add that States did not have the authority to regulate "labeling or packaging," an addition that would have been doubly superfluous, given FIFRA\'s historic focus on labeling to begin with.  <em>See Monsanto,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#991">467 U. S. 991</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Nor does FIFRA otherwise imply preemption.  While the 1972 amendments turned FIFRA into a "comprehensive regulatory statute," <em>Monsanto,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#991">467 U. S. 991</a></span>, the resulting scheme was not "so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it."  <em>Rice,</em> 331 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span>.  To the contrary, the statute leaves ample room for States and localities to supplement federal efforts even absent the express regulatory authorization of \xc2\xa7 136v(a).  FIFRA addresses numerous aspects of pesticide control in considerable detail, in particular:  registration and classification, \xc2\xa7 136a; applicator certification, \xc2\xa7 136b; inspection of pesticide production facilities, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 136e and 136g; and the possible ban and seizure of pesticides that are misbranded or otherwise fail to meet federal requirements, \xc2\xa7 136k.  These provisions reflect the general goal of the 1972 amendments to strengthen existing labeling requirements and insure that these requirements were followed in practice.  \xc2\xa7 136k.  <em>See Monsanto,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#991">467 U. S. 991</a></span>-992.  FIFRA nonetheless leaves substantial portions of the field vacant, including the area at issue in this case.  FIFRA nowhere seeks to establish an affirmative permit scheme for the actual use of pesticides.  It certainly does not equate registration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 501 U. S. 614</a></p><p> and labeling requirements with a general approval to apply pesticides throughout the Nation without regard to regional and local factors like climate, population, geography, and water supply.  Whatever else FIFRA may supplant, it does not occupy the field of pesticide regulation in general or the area of local use permitting in particular.</p>\n<p>In contrast to other implicitly preempted fields, the 1972 enhancement of FIFRA does not mean that the use of pesticides can occur</p>\n<p>"\'only by federal permission, subject to federal inspection, in the hands of federally certified personnel and under an intricate system of federal commands.\'"</p>\n<p><em>City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal,</em> 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/624/case.html#634">411 U. S. 634</a></span>, quoting <em>Northwest Airlines v.

The specific grant of authority in \xc2\xa7 136v(a) consequently does not serve to hand back to the States powers that the statute had impliedly usurped.  Rather, it acts to ensure that the States could continue to regulate use and sales even where, such as with regard to the banning of mislabeled products, a narrow preemptive overlap might occur.  As noted in our discussion of express preemption, it is doubtful that Congress intended to exclude localities from the scope of \xc2\xa7 136v(a)\'s authorization, but however this may be, the type of local regulation at issue here would not fall within any impliedly preempted field.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, like the EPA, we discern no actual conflict either between FIFRA and the ordinance before us or between FIFRA and local regulation generally.  Mortier does not rely, nor could he, on the theory that compliance with the ordinance and FIFRA is a "physical impossibility."  <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers,</em> 373 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U. S. 142</a></span>-143.  Instead, he urges that the town\'s ordinance stands as an obstacle to the statute\'s goals of promoting pesticide regulation that is coordinated solely on the federal and state levels, that rests upon some degree of technical expertise, and that does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 501 U. S. 615</a></p><p> unduly burden interstate commerce.  Each one of these assertions rests on little more than snippets of legislative history and policy speculations.  None of them is convincing.</p>\n<p>To begin with, FIFRA does not suggest a goal of regulatory coordination that sweeps either as exclusively or as broadly as Mortier contends.  The statute gives no indication that Congress was sufficiently concerned about this goal to require preemption of local use ordinances simply because they were enacted locally.  Mortier suggests otherwise, quoting legislative history which states that FIFRA establishes "a coordinated Federal-State administrative system to carry out the new program," and raising the specter of gypsy moth hoards safely navigating through thousands of contradictory and ineffective municipal regulations.  H.R.Rep. No. 92-511 at 1-2.  As we have made plain, the statute does not expressly or impliedly preclude regulatory action by political subdivisions with regard to local use.  To the contrary, FIFRA implies a regulatory partnership between federal, state, and local governments.  Section 136t(b) expressly states that the Administrator</p>\n<p>"shall cooperate with . . . any appropriate agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof, in carrying out the provisions of this [Act] and in securing uniformity of regulations."</p>\n<p>Nor does FIFRA suggest that any goal of coordination precludes local use ordinances because they were enacted independent of specific state or federal oversight.  As we have also made plain, local use permit regulations -- unlike labeling or certification -- do not fall within an area that FIFRA\'s "program" preempts, or even plainly addresses.  There is no indication that any coordination which the statute seeks to promote extends beyond the matters with which it deals, or does so strongly enough to compel the conclusion that an independently enacted ordinance that falls outside the statute\'s reach frustrates its purpose.</p>\n<p>FIFRA provides even less indication that local ordinances must yield to statutory purposes of promoting technical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="616">Page 501 U. S. 616</a></p><p> expertise or maintaining unfettered interstate commerce.  Once more, isolated passages of legislative history that were themselves insufficient to establish a preemptive congressional intent do not by themselves establish legislative goals with preemptive effect.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 92-838, at 16, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4007.  Mortier nonetheless asserts that local ordinances necessarily rest on insufficient expertise and burden commerce by allowing, among other things, large-scale crop infestation.  As with the specter of the gypsy moth, Congress is free to find that local regulation does wreak such havoc and enact legislation with the purpose of preventing it.  We are satisfied, however, that Congress has not done so yet.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We hold that FIFRA does not preempt the town of Casey\'s ordinance regulating the use of pesticides.

For one, his concurrence argues that the House Agriculture Committee made it clear that it wanted localities "out of the picture," because its report specifies as grounds for rejecting a proposal <em>permitting</em> the localities to regulate pesticides the observation that the Federal Government and the 50 States provided an adequate number of regulatory jurisdictions.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#617">501 U. S. 617</a></span>.  But the only way to infer that the Committee opposed not only a direct grant of regulatory authority upon localities but also state delegation of authority to regulate would be to suppose that the term "regulatory jurisdictions" meant regulatory for the purposes of exercising any authority at all as opposed to exercising authority derived from a direct Federal grant.  H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, p. 16 (1971).  The language of the Report does not answer this question one way or another.</p>\n<p>The concurrence further contends that the Senate Agriculture Committee unequivocally expressed its view that \xc2\xa7 136v should be read to deprive localities of regulatory authority over pesticides.  This may be true, but it is hardly dispositive.  Even if \xc2\xa7 136v were sufficiently ambiguous to justify reliance on legislative history, the meaning a committee puts forward must, at a minimum, be within the realm of meanings that the provision, fairly read, could bear.  Here the Report clearly states that \xc2\xa7 136v should be read as a prohibition, but it is just as clear that the provision is written exclusively in terms of a grant.  No matter how clearly its report purports to do so, a committee of Congress cannot take language that could only cover "flies" or "mosquitoes" and tell the courts that it really covers "ducks."</p>\n<p>Finally, the concurrence suggests that the Senate Commerce Committee report reconfirmed the views of the two agriculture committees that \xc2\xa7 136v prohibited local pesticide regulation.  <em>Post</em> at 618-620.  But the Commerce Committee at no point states, clearly or otherwise, that it agrees that the section before it does this.  Rather, the Report states that,</p>\n<p>"while the Agriculture Committee bill does not specifically prohibit local governments from regulating, <em>the report of that committee</em> states explicitly that local governments cannot regulate in any matter."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 90-970, p. 27 (1972) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4111 (emphasis added).  The Commerce Committee, indeed, went on to assert its policy differences with its Agriculture counterpart.  It did this by attempting to strike at the root of the problem through changing the language of the provision itself.  Far from showing agreement with its rival, the Commerce Committee\'s words and actions show a body that first, conceded <em>no</em> ground on the meaning of the disputed language and then second, raised the stakes by seeking to insure that the language could go only <em>its</em> way.  On both the existence and the desirability of a prohibition on local regulation, there can be no doubt that the Commerce and Agriculture Committees stood on the opposite sides of the Senate debate.</p>\n<p>As for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense suggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information, rather than ignoring it.  As Chief Justice Marshall put it, "[w]here the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes everything from which aid can be derived."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/358/case.html">Fisher v. Blight,</a></span></em> 2 Cranch 358,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/358/case.html#386">6 U. S. 386</a></span> (1805).  Legislative history materials are not generally so misleading that jurists should never employ them in a good faith effort to discern legislative intent.  Our precedents demonstrate that the Court\'s practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into its past.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/680/case.html">31 U. S. </a></span> Parker,</em> 6 Pet. 680,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/680/case.html#687">31 U. S. 687</a></span>-690 (1832).  We suspect that the practice will likewise reach well into the future.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that FIFRA does not preempt local regulation, because I agree that the terms of the statute do not alone manifest a preemption of the entire field of pesticide regulation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#611">501 U. S. 611</a></span>-614.  If there were field preemption, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136v would be understood not as restricting certain types of state regulation (for which purpose, it makes little sense to restrict States, but not their subdivisions), but as authorizing certain types of state regulation (for which purpose, it makes eminent sense to authorize States, but not their subdivisions).  But the field preemption question is certainly a close one.  Congress\' selective use of "State" and "State and political subdivisions thereof" would suggest the authorizing, rather than restricting, meaning of \xc2\xa7 136v, were it not for the inconsistent usage pointed to in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#601">501 U. S. </a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 501 U. S. 617</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As the Court today recognizes, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#606">501 U. S. 606</a></span>-607, the Wisconsin Justices agreed with me on this point, and would have come out the way that I and the Court do <em>but for</em> the Committee Reports contained in FIFRA\'s legislative history.  I think they were entirely right about the tenor of those reports.  Their only mistake was failing to recognize how unreliable Committee Reports are -- not only as a genuine indicator of congressional intent, but as a safe predictor of judicial construction.  We use them when it is convenient, and ignore them when it is not.</p>\n<p>Consider how the case would have been resolved if the committee reports were taken seriously:  the bill to amend FIFRA (H.R. 10729) was reported out of the House Committee on Agriculture on September 25, 1971.  According to the accompanying Committee Report:</p>\n<p>"The Committee rejected a proposal which would have permitted political subdivisions to further regulate pesticides on the grounds that the 50 States and the Federal Government should provide an adequate number of regulatory jurisdictions."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, p. 16 (1971).</p>\n<p>Had the <em>grounds</em> for the rejection not been specified, it would be possible to entertain the Court\'s speculation, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#609">501 U. S. 609</a></span>, that the Committee might have been opposing only <em>direct</em> conferral upon localities of authority to regulate, in contrast to state <em>delegation</em> of authority to regulate.  But once it is specified that an excessive number of regulatory jurisdictions is the problem -- that "50 States and the Federal Government" are enough -- then it becomes clear that the Committee wanted localities out of the picture, and thought that its bill placed them there.</p>\n<p>The House Agriculture Committee\'s bill was passed by the full House on November 9, 1971, and, upon transmittal to the Senate, was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, which reported it out on June 7, 1972.  The accompanying Committee Report both clearly confirms the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 501 U. S. 618</a></p><p> foregoing interpretation of the House Committee Report and clearly endorses the disposition that interpretation produces.</p>\n<p>"[We have] considered the decision of the House Committee to deprive political subdivisions of States and other local authorities of any authority or jurisdiction over pesticides and concurs with the decision of the House of Representatives.  Clearly, the fifty States and the Federal Government provide sufficient jurisdictions to properly regulate pesticides.  Moreover, few, if any, local authorities whether towns, counties, villages, or municipalities have the financial wherewithal to provide necessary expert regulation comparable with that provided by the State and Federal Governments.  On this basis and on the basis that permitting such regulation would be an extreme burden on interstate commerce, it is the intent that section [136v], by not providing any authority to political subdivisions and other local authorities of or in the States, should be understood as depriving such local authorities and political subdivisions of any and all jurisdiction and authority over pesticides and the regulation of pesticides."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-838, pp. 16-17 (1972), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4008 (emphasis added).  Clearer committee language "directing" the courts how to interpret a statute of Congress could not be found, and if such a direction had any binding effect, the question of interpretation in this case would be no question at all.</p>\n<p>But there is still more.  After the Senate Agriculture Committee reported the bill to the floor, it was re-referred to the Committee on Commerce, which reported it out on July 19, 1972.  The report of that Committee, plus the accompanying proposals for amendment of H.R. 10729, <em>reconfirmed</em> the interpretation of the Senate and House Agriculture committees.  The Report said: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="619">Page 501 U. S. 619</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"While the Agriculture Committee bill does not specifically prohibit local governments from regulating pesticides, the report of that committee states explicitly that local governments cannot regulate pesticides in any manner.  Many local governments now regulate pesticides to meet their own specific needs, which they are often better able to perceive than are State and Federal regulators."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-970, p. 27 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4111.  The Court claims that this passage, plus the amendment that it explains, show that</p>\n<p>"the two principal committees responsible for the bill [were] in disagreement over whether it preempted pesticide regulation by political subdivisions."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#610">501 U. S. 610</a></span>.  I confess that I am less practiced than others in the science of construing legislative history, but it seems to me that quite the opposite is the case.  The Senate Commerce Committee Report does not offer a different <em>interpretation</em> of the preemptive effect of H.R. 10729.  To the contrary, it acknowledges that the report of the originating committee "states explicitly that local governments cannot regulate pesticides in any manner," and then proceeds to a statement ("Many local governments now regulate pesticides, etc.") which questions not the <em>existence,</em> but the <em>desirability,</em> of that restriction on local regulatory power.  And since it agreed with the interpretation, but did not agree with the policy, the Senate Commerce Committee proposed an amendment to H.R. 10729 whose purpose, according to its report, was to</p>\n<p>"giv[e] local governments the authority to regulate the sale or use of a pesticide beyond the requirements imposed by State and Federal authorities."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 92-970 at 27, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4111.  In a supplemental Report, the Senate Agriculture Committee opposed the Commerce Committee\'s amendment, which it said would "giv[e] local governments the authority to regulate the sale or use of a pesticide," thereby "vitiat[ing]" the earlier Agriculture Committee Report.  S.Rep. No. 92-838, pt. 2, at 46-47 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4066.  This legislative history clearly demonstrates, I think, not (as the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 501 U. S. 620</a></p><p> Court would have it) that the two principal Senate committees disagreed about whether H.R. 10729 preempted local regulation, but that they were in complete accord that it <em>did,</em> and in disagreement over whether it <em>ought</em> to.</p>\n<p>Of course, that does not necessarily say anything about what Congress as a whole thought.  Assuming that all the members of the three committees in question (as opposed to just the relevant subcommittees) actually adverted to the interpretive point at issue here -- which is probably an unrealistic assumption -- and assuming further that they were in <em>unanimous</em> agreement on the point, they would still represent less than two-fifths of the Senate, and less than one-tenth of the House.  It is most unlikely that many Members of either chamber read the pertinent portions of the Committee Reports before voting on the bill -- assuming (we cannot be sure) that the Reports were available before the vote.  Those pertinent portions, though they dominate our discussion today, constituted less than a quarter-page of the 82-page House Agriculture Committee Report, and less than a half-page each of the 74-page Senate Agriculture Committee Report, the 46-page Senate Commerce Committee Report, and the 73-page Senate Agriculture Committee Supplemental Report.  Those Reports, in turn, were a minuscule portion of the total number of reports that the Members of Congress were receiving (and presumably even writing) during the period in question.  In the Senate, at least, there was a vote on an amendment (the Commerce Committee proposal) that would have changed the result of the supposed interpretation.  But the full Senate could have rejected that <em>either</em> because a majority of its Members disagreed with the Commerce Committee\'s proposed policy; <em>or</em> because they disagreed with the Commerce Committee\'s and the Agriculture Committee\'s interpretation (and thus thought the amendment superfluous); <em>or</em> because they were blissfully ignorant of the entire dispute, and simply thought that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="621">Page 501 U. S. 621</a></p><p> Commerce Committee, by asking for recommittal and proposing 15 amendments, was being a troublemaker; <em>or</em> because three different minorities (enough to make a majority) had each of these respective reasons.  We have no way of knowing; indeed, we have no way of knowing that they had any <em>rational</em> motive at all.</p>\n<p>All we know for sure is that the full Senate adopted the text that we have before us here, as did the full House, pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the Constitution; and that that text, having been transmitted to the President and approved by him, again pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the Constitution, became law.  On the important question before us today, whether that law denies local communities throughout the Nation significant powers of self-protection, we should try to give the text its fair meaning, whatever various committees might have had to say -- thereby affirming the proposition that we are a Government of laws, not of committee reports.  That is, at least, the way I prefer to proceed.</p>\n<p>If I believed, however, that the meaning of a statute is to be determined by committee reports, I would have to conclude that a meaning opposite to our judgment has been commanded three times over -- not only by one committee in each house, but by <em>two</em> committees in one of them.  Today\'s decision reveals that, in their judicial application, committee reports are a forensic, rather than an interpretive, device, to be invoked when they support the decision and ignored when they do not.  To my mind that is infinitely better than honestly giving them dispositive effect.  But it would be better still to stop confusing the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and not to use committee reports at all.</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court responds to this concurrence in a footnote, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#610">501 U. S. 610</a></span>-612 n. 4, asserting that the legislative history is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="622">Page 501 U. S. 622</a></p><p> really ambiguous.  I leave it to the reader to judge.  I must reply, however, to the Court\'s assertion that the "practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into [our] past," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html#612">501 U. S. 612</a></span> n. 4, for which proposition it cites an opinion written by none other than John Marshall himself, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/680/case.html">Wallace v. Parker,</a></span></em> 6 Pet. 680 (1832).  What the Court neglects to explain is that what it means by "the practice of utilizing legislative history" is <em>not</em> the practice of utilizing legislative history for the purpose of giving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory text -- which is the only practice I object to.  Marshall used factual statements in the report of an Ohio legislative committee "as part of the record" in the case, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/680/case.html#689">31 U. S. 689</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/680/case.html#690">31 U. S. 690</a></span>, assuming that that was permissible "under the laws of Ohio," <em>ibid.</em>  I do not object to such use.  But that is quite different from the recent practice of relying upon legislative material to provide an authoritative interpretation of a statutory text.  That would have shocked John Marshall.  As late as 1897, we stated quite clearly that there is</p>\n<p>"a general acquiescence in the doctrine that debates in Congress are not appropriate sources of information from which to discover the meaning of the language of a statute passed by that body."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

S. 290</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/166/290/case.html#318">166 U. S. 318</a></span>.  And even as late as 1953, the practice of using legislative history in that fashion was novel enough that Justice Jackson could dismiss it as a "psychoanalysis of Congress," and a "weird endeavor."  <em>United States v.

It is, in short, almost entirely a phenomenon of this century -- and in its extensive use a very recent phenomenon.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Carro &amp; Brann, Use of Legislative Histories by the United States Supreme Court:  A Statistical Analysis, 9 J.Legis. 282 (1982); Wald, Some Observations on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Court Term, 68 Iowa L.Rev.195, 196-197 (1983).</p>\n<p>I am depressed if the Court is predicting that the use of legislative history for the purpose I have criticized "will . . . </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 501 U.
