S. 387</a></p><p> that the Secretary unlawfully rejected a California Medicaid plan amendment because an internal agency manual stating approval of the type of provision in question was a binding regulation, and because acceptance of the amendment was required by \xc2\xa7 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 1112, note following 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a (1982 ed., Supp. III).  <em>Cubanski v. Heckler,</em> 781 F.2d 1421 (1986).  After the case had been briefed and argued, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 4106 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330, which required the Secretary to approve the proposed California amendment, retroactively to the date of its proposal.  The Secretary has complied with that requirement.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that these developments have rendered the controversy moot.  In accordance with our established practice, we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand with instructions to dismiss the suit.  <em>See Deakins v.
