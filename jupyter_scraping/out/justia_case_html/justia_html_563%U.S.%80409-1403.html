John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton).  EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock price, in violation of \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  EPJ Fund also contends that Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures that caused the stock price to drop and, consequently, investors to lose money.  EPJ Fund sought to have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  The District Court found that the suit could proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Fifth Circuit precedent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive conduct caused the investors\xe2\x80\x99 claimed economic loss\xe2\x80\x94in order to obtain class certification.  The District Court concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to satisfy that requirement.  The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the denial of class certification.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation in order to obtain class certification.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In order to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a court must find \xe2\x80\x9cthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Considering whether \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate\xe2\x80\x9d begins, of course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action.  The elements of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 are: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.</em> v. <em>Siracusano</em>, 563 U. S. ___, ___. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in such an action often turns on the element of reliance.  The traditional way a plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a company\xe2\x80\x99s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing common stock\xe2\x80\x94based on that specific misrepresentation.  The Court recognized in <em>Basic Inc.</em> v. <em>Levinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/224/index.html">485 U. S. 224</a>, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would\xe2\x80\x9d prevent such plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cfrom proceeding with a class action, since individual issues\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelm[ ] the common ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 242.  The Court in <em>Basic</em> sought to alleviate that concern by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d theory.  According to that theory, \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 246.  Under that doctrine, the Court explained, one can assume an investor relies on public misstatements whenever he \xe2\x80\x9cbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 247.  The Court also made clear that the presumption could be rebutted by appropriate evidence.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption of reliance.  According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund had to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to trigger the presumption.  That requirement is not justified by <em>Basic</em> or its logic.  This Court has never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption.  Loss causation addresses a matter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action as \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction causation,\xe2\x80\x9d not loss causation.  <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/336/index.html">544 U. S. 336</a>, 341\xe2\x80\x93342.  Consistent with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied on a misrepresentation, the Court has typically focused on facts surrounding the investor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to engage in the transaction.  Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepresentation caused a subsequent economic loss.  That has nothing to do with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule contravenes <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental premise\xe2\x80\x94that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance.  Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually require EPJ Fund to prove \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court has used that term.  According to Halliburton, \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d was shorthand for a different analysis.  The lower court\xe2\x80\x99s actual inquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first place. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not accept EPJ Fund\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion.  Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities law; it is not price impact.  Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.  The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word.  Based on those words, the decision below cannot stand.

(EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton).  The suit was brought on behalf of all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock between June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate its stock price, in violation of \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  See 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b); 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2010).  The complaint asserts that Halliburton deliberately made false statements about (1) the scope of its potential liability in asbestos litigation, (2) its expected revenue from certain construction contracts, and (3) the benefits of its merger with another company.  EPJ Fund contends that Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures that caused its stock price to drop and, consequently, investors to lose money.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  The parties agreed, and the District Court held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general requirements for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the claims of the representative parties were typical, and the representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court also found that the action could proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d in order to obtain class certification.  <em>Id.</em>, at 4a, and n.\xc2\xa02 (citing <em>Oscar Private Equity Invs. </em>v. <em>Allegiance Telecom, Inc.</em>, 487 F.\xc2\xa03d 261, 269 (CA5 2007)).  As the District Court explained, loss causation is the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the [economic] loss\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d suffered by investors.

After reviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective disclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not certify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to establish loss causation with respect to any\xe2\x80\x9d of its claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.  The court made clear, however, that absent \xe2\x80\x9cthis stringent loss causation requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d it would have granted the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s certification request.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certification.  See 597 F.\xc2\xa03d 330 (CA5 2010).  It confirmed that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n order to obtain class certification on its claims, [EPJ Fund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the corrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 334.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to meet the \xe2\x80\x9crequirements for proving loss causation at the class certification stage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 344.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the Fund\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, 562 U.

We agree.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(3).  In order to certify a class under that Rule, a court must find \xe2\x80\x9cthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa023(b)(3).  Considering whether \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate\xe2\x80\x9d begins, of course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action.  The elements of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 are: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misre-\npresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.</em> v. <em>Siracusano</em>, 563 U.

S. 148</a>, 157 (2008)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in a securities fraud action often turns on the element of reliance.  The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to establish that reliance was capable of resolution on a common, classwide basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cReliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive acts is an essential element of the \xc2\xa710(b) private cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stoneridge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 159.  This is because proof of reliance ensures that there is a proper \xe2\x80\x9cconnection between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Basic Inc.</em> v. <em>Levinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/224/index.html">485 U. S. 224</a>, 243 (1988).  The traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can\ndemonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware\nof a company\xe2\x80\x99s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, purchasing common stock\xe2\x80\x94based on that specific misrepresentation.  In that situation, the plaintiff plainly would have relied on the company\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive conduct.  A plaintiff unaware of the relevant statement, on the other hand, could not establish reliance on that basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognized in <em>Basic</em>, however, that limiting proof of reliance in such a way \xe2\x80\x9cwould place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 245.  We also observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would\xe2\x80\x9d prevent such plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cfrom proceeding with a class action, since individual issues\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelm[ ] the common ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 242.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Basic</em> sought to alleviate those related concerns by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud-on-the-market\xe2\x80\x9d theory.  According to that theory, \xe2\x80\x9cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 246.  Because the market \xe2\x80\x9ctransmits information to the investor in the processed form of a market price,\xe2\x80\x9d we can assume, the Court explained, that an investor relies on public misstatements whenever he \xe2\x80\x9cbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 244, 247 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Stoneridge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 159; <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals</em>, 544 U. S., at 341\xe2\x80\x93342.  The Court also made clear that the presumption was just that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence.  See <em>Basic</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 248.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption of reliance.  It is common ground, for example, that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known (else how would the market take them into account?), that the stock traded in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 248, n. 27; <em>id.</em>, at 241\xe2\x80\x93247; see also <em>Stoneridge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 159.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to establish loss causation at the certification stage to \xe2\x80\x9ctrigger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  597 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>ibid.</em> (EPJ Fund must \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a causal link between the alleged falsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court determined that, in order to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ Fund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s stock was \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the correction to a prior misleading statement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat the subsequent loss could not otherwise be explained by some additional factors revealed then to the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 336 (emphasis deleted).  This is the loss causation requirement as we have described it.  See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 342; see also 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 requirement is not justified by <em>Basic</em> or its logic.  To begin, we have never before mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption of reliance.  The term \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d does not even appear in our <em>Basic</em> opinion.  And for good reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have referred to the element of reliance in a pri-\nvate Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 action as \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction causation,\xe2\x80\x9d not loss causation.  <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 341\xe2\x80\x93342 (citing <em>Basic</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 248\xe2\x80\x93249).  Consistent with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused on facts surrounding the investor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to engage in the transaction.  See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals</em>, <em>supra</em>, at\n342.  Under <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fraud-on-the-market doctrine, an in-vestor presumptively relies on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepre-sentation if that \xe2\x80\x9cinformation is reflected in [the] market price\xe2\x80\x9d of the stock at the time of the relevant transaction.  See <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 247.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the market price <em>also</em> caused a subsequent economic loss.  As we made clear in <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals</em>, the fact that a stock\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprice on the date of purchase was inflated because of [a] misrepresentation\xe2\x80\x9d does not necessarily mean that the misstatement is the cause of a later decline in value.  544 U. S., at 342 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  We observed that the drop could instead be the result of other intervening causes, such as \xe2\x80\x9cchanged economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343.  If one of those factors were responsible for the loss or part of it, a plaintiff would not be able to prove loss causation to that extent.  This is true even if the investor purchased the stock at a distorted price, and thereby presumptively relied on the misrepresentation reflected in that price.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the Court of Appeals, however, an inability to prove loss causation would prevent a plaintiff from invoking the rebuttable presumption of reliance.  Such a rule contravenes <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental premise\xe2\x80\x94that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.  The fact that a subsequent loss may have been caused by factors other than the revelation of a misrepresentation has nothing to do with whether an investor relied on the misrepresentation in the first place, either directly or presumptively through the fraud-on-the-market theory.  Loss causation has no logical connection to the facts necessary to establish the efficient market predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund \nto show loss causation as a condition of obtaining class certification.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reliance or otherwise achieve class certification.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26\xe2\x80\x9329.  Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually require plaintiffs to prove \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d as we have used that term.  See <em>id.</em>, at 27 (\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not loss causation as this Court knows it in <em>Dura</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to Halliburton, \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d was merely \xe2\x80\x9cshorthand\xe2\x80\x9d for a different analysis.  Brief for Respondents 18.  The lower court\xe2\x80\x99s actual inquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first place.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9319, 24\xe2\x80\x9327, 50\xe2\x80\x9351; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (stating that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctest is simply price impact\xe2\x80\x9d and that EPJ Fund\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9conly burden under the Fifth Circuit case law was to show price\nimpact\xe2\x80\x9d).*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPrice impact\xe2\x80\x9d simply refers to the effect of a misrepresentation on a stock price.  Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s theory is that if a misrepresentation does not affect market price, an investor cannot be said to have relied on the misrepresentation merely because he purchased stock at that price.  If the price is unaffected by the fraud, the price does not reflect the fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not accept Halliburton\xe2\x80\x99s wishful interpretation of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion.  As we have explained, loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities law; it is not price impact.  While the opinion below may include some language consistent with a \xe2\x80\x9cprice impact\xe2\x80\x9d approach, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 597 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336, we simply cannot ignore the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 repeated and explicit references to \xe2\x80\x9closs causation,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>id.</em>, at 334 (three times), 334 n.\xc2\xa02, 335, 335 n.\xc2\xa010 (twice), 335 n.\xc2\xa011, 336, 336 n.\xc2\xa019, 336 n.\xc2\xa020, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341 n. 46, 342 n. 47, 343, 344 (three times).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation: \xe2\x80\x9c[EPJ Fund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the corrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.\xe2\x80\x9d  597 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 334; see <em>id.</em>, at 335 (\xe2\x80\x9cwe require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market presumption\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We take the Court of Appeals at its word.  Based on those words, the decision below cannot stand.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we conclude the Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund to prove loss causation at the certification stage, we need not, and do not, address any other question about <em>Basic</em>, its presumption, or how and when it may be rebutted.  To the extent Halliburton has preserved any further arguments against class certification, they may be addressed in the first instance by the Court of Appeals on remand.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Halliburton further concedes that, even if its conception of what the Court of Appeals meant by \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d is correct, the Court of Appeals erred by placing the initial burden on EPJ Fund.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe agree . . . that the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production on the plaintiff, and that\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to Halliburton, a plaintiff must prove price impact only after <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption has been successfully rebutted by the defendant.
