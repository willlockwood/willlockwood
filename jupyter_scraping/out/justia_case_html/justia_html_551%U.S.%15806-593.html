Under a Labor Department (DOL) regulation labeled an \xe2\x80\x9cInterpretatio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d (hereinafter third-party regulation), the exemption includes those \xe2\x80\x9ccompanionship\xe2\x80\x9d workers \xe2\x80\x9cemployed by an \xe2\x80\xa6 agency other than the family or household using their services.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7552.109(a).  However, DOL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulations\xe2\x80\x9d also define the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cservices of a household nature performed by an employee in or about a private home<em> \xe2\x80\xa6 of the person by whom he or she is employed</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552.3 (emphasis added).

The parties assume the FLSA requires the payments only if its \xe2\x80\x9ccompanionship services\xe2\x80\x9d exemption does not apply to workers paid by third-party agencies such as Long Island Care.  The District Court dismissed the suit, finding the third-party regulation valid and controlling.

S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843.  When an agency fills such a gap reasonably, and in accordance with other applicable (<em>e.g.</em>, procedural) requirements, that result is legally binding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  On its face, the third-party regulation seems to fill a statutory gap.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The regulation does not exceed DOL\xe2\x80\x99s delegated rulemaking authority.  The FLSA explicitly leaves gaps as to the scope and definition of its \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccompanionship services\xe2\x80\x9d terms, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(15), and empowers the DOL to fill these gaps through regulations, 1974 Amendments, \xc2\xa729(b).  Whether to include workers paid by third parties is one of the details left to the DOL to work out.  Although the pre-1974 FLSA already covered <em>some </em>third-party-paid companionship workers, <em>e.g.</em>, those employed by large private enterprises, it did not then cover others, <em>e.g.,</em> those employed directly by the aged person\xe2\x80\x99s family or by many smaller private agencies.  Thus, whether, or how, the statutory definition should apply to such workers raises a set of complex questions, <em>e.g., </em>should the FLSA cover <em>all </em>of them, <em>some</em> of them, or <em>none</em> of them?  How should the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemption be weighed against the fact that some (but not all) of the workers were previously covered?  Given the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s expertise, satisfactory answers to the foregoing questions may well turn upon its thorough knowledge of the area and ability to consult at length with affected parties.  It is therefore reasonable to infer that Congress intended its broad grant of definitional authority to the DOL to include the authority to answer such questions.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the Social Security statute, whose text expressly answers a \xe2\x80\x9cthird party\xe2\x80\x9d coverage question, and on conflicting statements in the 1974 Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 legislative history, is unavailing.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Although the literal language of the third-party regulation and the \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7552.3, conflicts as to whether third-party-paid workers are included within the statutory exemption, several reasons compel the Court to agree with the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s position, set forth in an \xe2\x80\x9cAdvisory Memorandum\xe2\x80\x9d explaining (and defending) the third-party regulation, that that regulation governs here.  First, a decision that \xc2\xa7552.3 controls would create serious problems as to the coverage of particular domestic service employees by the statutory exemption or by the FLSA as a whole.  Second, given that the third-party regulation\xe2\x80\x99s <em>sole purpose </em>is to explain how the companionship services exemption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, whereas \xc2\xa7552.3\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose is to describe the <em>kind of work</em> that must be performed to qualify someone as a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service\xe2\x80\x9d employee, the third-party regulation is the more specific with respect to the question at issue and therefore governs, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morales</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/374/index.html">504 U. S. 374</a>, 384\xe2\x80\x93385.  Third, that the DOL may have interpreted the two regulations differently at different times in their history is not a ground for disregarding the present interpretation, which the DOL reached after proposing a different interpretation through notice-and-comment rulemaking, making any unfair surprise unlikely, cf. <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Georgetown Univ. Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/204/index.html">488 U. S. 204</a>, 212.  Fourth, while the Advisory Memorandum was issued only to DOL personnel and written in response to this litigation, this Court has accepted such an interpretation where, as here, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s course of action indicates that its interpretation of its own regulation reflects its considered views on the matter in question and there is no reason to suspect that its interpretation is merely a <em>post hoc</em> rationalization.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Several factors compel the Court to reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the third-party regulation is an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation\xe2\x80\x9d not meant to fill a statutory \xe2\x80\x9cgap,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply to describe the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s view of what the FLSA means, and thus is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 232.  For one thing, the regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98affecting individual rights and obligations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/index.html">441 U. S. 281</a>, 302.  When promulgating the regulation and when considering amending it, the DOL has always employed full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) need not be used when producing an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive\xe2\x80\x9d rule, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(A).  And for the past 30 years, according to the Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the DOL has treated the regulation as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority.  For another thing, the DOL may have placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B of Part 552, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cInterpretations,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than in Subpart A, \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d because Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying Subpart A\xe2\x80\x99s more general definitions.  Indeed, Subpart B\xe2\x80\x99s other regulations\xe2\x80\x94involving, <em>e.g.,</em> employer \xe2\x80\x9ccredit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d against minimum wages for provision of \xe2\x80\x9cfood,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clodging,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdrycleaning\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94strongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, are at issue.  Finally, the Court assumes <em>Congress</em> meant and expected courts to treat a regulation as within a delegation of \xe2\x80\x9cgap-filling\xe2\x80\x9d authority where, as here, the rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue and uses full notice-and-comment procedures, and the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority and is reasonable.  <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 229\xe2\x80\x93233.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0The Court disagrees with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s 1974 notice-and-comment proceedings were legally \xe2\x80\x9cdefective\xe2\x80\x9d because the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s notice and explanation were inadequate.  Fair notice is the object of the APA requirement that a notice of proposed rulemaking contain \xe2\x80\x9ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(3).  The Circuits have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed.  Initially, the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s proposed regulation would have placed outside the \xc2\xa7213(a)(15) exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by the large enterprise third-party employers covered before 1974.  Since that was simply a proposal, however, its presence meant that the DOL was <em>considering </em>the matter and might later choose to keep the proposal or to withdraw it.  The DOL finally withdrew it, resulting in a determination exempting <em>all</em> third-party-employed companionship workers from the FLSA, and that possibility was reasonably foreseeable.  There is also no significant legal problem with the DOL\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that its final interpretation is more consistent with FLSA language.  No one seems to have objected to this explanation at the time, and it still remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation.

She claims that the words \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d limit the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope to those workers employed by persons who themselves receive the services (or are part of that person\xe2\x80\x99s household) and exclude those who are employed by \xe2\x80\x9cthird parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she advances several arguments in favor of this position.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent points to the overall purpose of the 1974 Amendments, namely to <em>extend </em>FLSA coverage, see, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 93\xe2\x80\x93232, pp. 2, 8 (1973); she notes that prior to the amendments the FLSA already covered companionship workers employed by certain third parties (<em>e.g.</em>, private agencies that were large enough, in terms of annual sales, to qualify for the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9centerprise coverage\xe2\x80\x9d provisions, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7206(a), 207(a)(1) (1970 ed.), see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7203(r), (s)(1) (defining \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9centerprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce\xe2\x80\x9d)); and she concludes that Congress must therefore have meant its \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d language in the exemption to apply only to persons not employed by third parties such as Long Island Care.  Respondent tries to bolster this argument by pointing to statements made by some Members of Congress during floor debates over the 1974 Amendments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (1973) (statement of Sen. Burdick) (\xe2\x80\x9cI am not concerned about the professional domestic who does this as a daily living,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather about \xe2\x80\x9cpeople who might have an aged father, an aged mother, an infirm father, an infirm mother, and a neighbor comes in and sits with them\xe2\x80\x9d).  And she also points to a different statute, the Social Security statute, which defines \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d as domestic work performed in \xe2\x80\x9ca private home <em>of the employer.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73510(c)(1) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not find these arguments convincing.  The statutory language refers broadly to \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9ccompanionship services.\xe2\x80\x9d  It expressly instructs the agency to work out the details of those broad definitions.  And whether to include workers paid by third parties within the scope of the definitions is one of those details.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the FLSA in 1974 already covered <em>some </em>of the third-party-paid workers, it did not at that point cover others.  It did not cover, for example, companionship workers employed directly by the aged person\xe2\x80\x99s family; nor did it cover workers employed by many smaller private agencies.  The result is that whether, or how, the definition should apply to workers paid by third parties raises a set of complex questions.  Should the FLSA cover <em>all </em>companionship workers paid by third parties?  Or should the FLSA cover <em>some</em> such companionship workers, perhaps those working for some (say, large but not small) private agencies, or those hired by a son or daughter to help an aged or infirm mother living in a distant city?  Should it cover <em>none</em>?  How should one weigh the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemption against the fact that some (but not all) third-party employees were previously covered?  Satisfactory answers to such questions may well turn upon the kind of thorough knowledge of the subject matter and ability to consult at length with affected parties that an agency, such as the Department of Labor, possesses.  And it is consequently reasonable to infer (and we do infer) that Congress intended its broad grant of definitional authority to the Department to include the authority to answer these kinds of questions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because respondent refers to the Social Security statute and the legislative history, we add that unlike the text of the Social Security statute, the text of the FLSA does not expressly answer the third-party-employment question.  Compare 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73510(c)(1) with 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(15).  Nor can one find any clear answer in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history.  Compare 119 Cong. Rec. 24801 (statement of Sen. Burdick, quoted above), with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 24798 (statement of Sen. Johnston) (expressing concern that requiring payment of minimum wage to companionship workers might make such services so expensive that some people would be forced to leave the work force in order to take care of aged or infirm parents).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent says that the third-party regulation conflicts with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulation\xe2\x80\x9d that defines the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Title 29 CFR \xc2\xa7552.3 says that the term covers services \xe2\x80\x9cof a household nature performed by \xe2\x80\xa6 employee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cmaids\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccooks\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chousekeepers\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccaretakers\xe2\x80\x9d and others, \xe2\x80\x9cin or about a private home \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>of the person by whom he or she is employed</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  See also \xc2\xa7552.101(a).  A companionship worker employed by a third party to work at the home of an aged or infirm man or woman is not working at the \xe2\x80\x9chome \xe2\x80\xa6 of the person by whom he or she is employed\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, she is not working at the home of the third-party employer).  Hence, the two regulations are inconsistent, for the one limits the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employee\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(15) exemption to workers employed by the household, but the other includes in the subclass of exempt companionship workers persons who are <em>not</em> employed by the household.  Respondent adds that, given the conflict, the former \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulation\xe2\x80\x9d must govern (primarily because, in her view, only the former regulation is entitled to <em>Chevron</em> deference, an issue we address in Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>infra</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent is correct when she says that the literal language of the two regulations conflicts as to whether workers paid by third parties are included within the statutory exemption.  The question remains, however, which regulation governs in light of this conflict.  The Department, in its Advisory Memorandum, suggests that the third-party regulation governs, and we agree, for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, if we were to decide the contrary, <em>i.e.</em>, that the text of the General Regulation, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7552.3, controls on the issue of third-party employment, our interpretation  would  create serious problems.  Although \xc2\xa7552.3 states that it is supplying a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s [that term is] used\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory exemption, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(a)(15), the rule appears in other ways to have been meant to supply a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d for the FLSA as a whole (a prospect the Department endorses in its Advisory Memorandum).  Why else would the Department have included the extensive list of qualifying professions, virtually none of which have anything to do with the subjects of \xc2\xa7213(a)(15), babysitting and companionship services?  But if we were to apply \xc2\xa7552.3\xe2\x80\x99s literal definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d (including the \xe2\x80\x9chome \xe2\x80\xa6 of the [employer]\xe2\x80\x9d language) across the FLSA, that would place outside the scope of FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s wage and hour rules any butlers, chauffeurs, and so forth who are employed by <em>any</em> third party.  That result seems clearly contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent in enacting the 1974 Amendments, particularly if it would withdraw from FLSA coverage all domestic service employees previously covered by the \xe2\x80\x9centerprise coverage\xe2\x80\x9d provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, on the other hand, \xc2\xa7552.3\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service employment\xe2\x80\x9d were limited to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s exemption provision, applying this definition literally (by removing all third-party employees from the exemption) would extend the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage not simply to third-party-employed companionship workers paid by large institutions, but also to those paid directly by a family member of an elderly or infirm person receiving such services whenever the family member lived in a different household than the invalid.  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to make the exemption contingent on whether a family member chose to reside in the same household as the invalid, and it is a result that respondent herself seems to wish to avoid.  See Brief for Respondent 34, n. 31.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, normally the specific governs the general.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Morales</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/374/index.html">504 U. S. 374</a>, 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (1992); <em>Simpson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/6/index.html">435 U. S. 6</a>, 15 (1978).  The <em>sole purpose</em> of the third-party regulation, \xc2\xa7552.109(a), is to explain how the companionship services exemption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, whereas the primary (if not sole) purpose of the conflicting general definitional regulation, \xc2\xa7552.3, is to describe the <em>kind of work</em> that must be performed by someone to qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic service\xe2\x80\x9d employee.  Given that context, \xc2\xa7552.109(a) is the more specific regulation with respect to the third-party-employment question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, we concede that the Department may have interpreted these regulations differently at different times in their history.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 58 Fed. Reg. 69311 (employees of a third-party employer qualify for the exemption only if they are also jointly employed \xe2\x80\x9cby the family or household using their services\xe2\x80\x9d); D. Sweeney, DOL Opinion Letter, Home Health Aides/Companionship Exemption, 6A LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8205 (Jan. 6, 1999) (similar).  But as long as interpretive changes create no unfair surprise\xe2\x80\x94and the Department\xe2\x80\x99s recourse to notice-and-comment rulemaking in an attempt to codify its new interpretation, see 58 Fed. Reg. 69311, makes any such surprise unlikely here\xe2\x80\x94the change in interpretation alone presents no separate ground for disregarding the Department\xe2\x80\x99s present interpretation.  Cf. <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Georgetown Univ. Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/204/index.html">488 U. S. 204</a>, 212 (1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, we must also concede, as respondent points out, that the Department set forth its most recent interpretation of these regulations in an \xe2\x80\x9cAdvisory Memorandum\xe2\x80\x9d issued only to internal Department personnel and which the Department appears to have written in response to this litigation.  We have \xe2\x80\x9cno reason,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cto suspect that [this] interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d is merely a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>post hoc</em> rationalizatio[n]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of past agency action, or that it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 462 (1997) (quoting <em>Bowen</em>, <em>supra</em>).  Where, as here, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s course of action indicates that the interpretation of its own regulation reflects its considered views\xe2\x80\x94the Department has clearly struggled with the third-party-employment question since at least 1993\xe2\x80\x94we have accepted that interpretation as the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own, even if the agency set those views forth in a legal brief.  See 519 U. S., at 462.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, we conclude that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the two regulations falls well within the principle that an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own regulations is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling\xe2\x80\x9d unless \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the regulations being interpreted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 461 (quoting <em>Robertson</em> v. <em>Methow Valley Citizens Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/332/index.html">490 U. S. 332</a>, 359 (1989), in turn quoting <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/325/410/index.html">325 U. S. 410</a>, 414 (1945)).  See also <em>Udall</em> v. <em>Tallman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/1/index.html">380 U. S. 1</a>, 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (1965).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent also argues that, even if the third-party regulation is within the scope of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s delegation, is perfectly reasonable, and otherwise complies with the law, courts still should not treat the regulation as legally binding.  Her reason is a special one.  She says that the regulation is an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive\xe2\x80\x9d regulation, a kind of regulation that may be used, not to fill a statutory \xe2\x80\x9cgap,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply to describe an agency\xe2\x80\x99s view of what a statute means.  That kind of regulation may \xe2\x80\x9cpersuade\xe2\x80\x9d a reviewing court, <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140 (1944), but will not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cbind\xe2\x80\x9d a reviewing court.  Cf. <em>Mead</em>, 533 U. S., at 232 (\xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive rules \xe2\x80\xa6 enjoy no <em>Chevron </em>status <em>as a</em> <em>class</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like respondent, the Court of Appeals concluded that the third-party regulation did not fill a statutory gap and hence was not legally binding.  376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 131\xe2\x80\x93133; 462 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  It based its conclusion upon three considerations: First, when the Department promulgated a series of regulations to implement the \xc2\xa7213(a)(15) exemptions, 29 CFR pt. 552, it placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cInterpretations,\xe2\x80\x9d not in Subpart A, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, the Department said that regulations 552.3, .4, .5, and .6, all in Subpart A, contained the \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitions\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute \xe2\x80\x9crequire[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Third, the Department initially said in 1974 that Subpart A would \xe2\x80\x9cdefin[e] and delimi[t] \xe2\x80\xa6the ter[m] \xe2\x80\x98domestic service employee,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d while Subpart B would \xe2\x80\x9cse[t] forth \xe2\x80\xa6 a statement of general policy and interpretation concerning the application of the [FLSA] to domestic service employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  376 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 131\xe2\x80\x93132; 462 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (quoting 39 Fed. Reg. 35382).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These reasons do not convince us that the Department intended its third-party regulation to carry no special legal weight.  For one thing, other considerations strongly suggest the contrary, namely that the Department intended the third-party regulation as a binding application of its rulemaking authority.  The regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98affecting individual rights and obligations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/index.html">441 U. S. 281</a>, 302 (1979) (quoting <em>Morton,</em> 415 U. S., at 232).  When promulgating the rule, the agency used full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act an agency need not use when producing an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive\xe2\x80\x9d rule.  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(A) (exempting \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\xe2\x80\x9d from notice-and-comment procedures).  Each time the Department has considered amending the rule, it has similarly used full notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.  58 Fed. Reg. 69310 (1993); 60 Fed. Reg. 46797 (1995); 66 Fed. Reg. 5485 (2001).  And for the past 30 years, according to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the Department has treated the third-party regulation like the others, <em>i.e.</em>, as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority.  App. E to Pet. for Cert. 63a\xe2\x80\x9364a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the Subpart B heading \xe2\x80\x9cInterpretations\xe2\x80\x9d (and the other indicia upon which the Court of Appeals relied) could well refer to the fact that Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying the more general definitions of Subpart A.  Indeed, Subpart B\xe2\x80\x99s other regulations\xe2\x80\x94involving such matters as employer \xe2\x80\x9ccredit[s]\xe2\x80\x9d against minimum wage payments for provision of \xe2\x80\x9cfood,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clodging,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdrycleaning,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 CFR \xc2\xa7552.100(b), and so forth\xe2\x80\x94strongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, are at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the ultimate question is whether <em>Congress</em> would have intended, and expected, courts to treat an agency\xe2\x80\x99s rule, regulation, application of a statute, or other agency action as within, or outside, its delegation to the agency of \xe2\x80\x9cgap-filling\xe2\x80\x9d authority.  Where an agency rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule, where the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority, and where the rule itself is reasonable, then a court ordinarily assumes that Congress intended it to defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  See <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 229\xe2\x80\x93233.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three contrary considerations to which the Court of Appeals points are insufficient, in our view, to overcome the other factors we have mentioned, all of which suggest that courts should defer to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  And that, in our view, is what the law requires.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s final claim is that the 1974 agency notice-and-comment procedure, leading to the promulgation of the third-party regulation, was legally \xe2\x80\x9cdefective\xe2\x80\x9d because notice was inadequate and the Department\xe2\x80\x99s explanation also inadequate.  We do not agree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking to publish in its notice of proposed rulemaking \xe2\x80\x9ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(3).  The Courts of Appeals have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule the agency adopts must be \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98logical outgrowth\xe2\x80\x99 of the rule proposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Black Media Coalition</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 791 F.\xc2\xa02d 1016, 1022 (CA2 1986).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United Steelworkers of America, AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO\xe2\x80\x93CLC</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, 647 F.\xc2\xa02d 1189, 1221 (CADC 1980), cert. denied <em>sub nom.</em> <em>Lead Industries Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Donovan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/913/index.html">453 U. S. 913</a> (1981); <em>South Terminal Corp.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 504 F.\xc2\xa02d 646, 659 (CA1 1974).  The object, in short, is one of fair notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Initially the Department proposed a rule of the kind that respondent seeks, namely a rule that would have placed outside the exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by  third-party employers whom the Act had covered prior to 1974.  39 Fed. Reg. 35385 (companionship workers \xe2\x80\x9cnot exempt\xe2\x80\x9d if employed by a third party that already was a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d under the FLSA).  The clear implication of the proposed rule was that companionship workers employed by third-party enterprises that <em>were not</em> covered by the FLSA prior to the 1974 Amendments (<em>e.g.</em>, most smaller private agencies) <em>would</em> be included within the \xc2\xa7213(a)(15) exemption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the proposed rule was simply a proposal, its presence meant that the Department was <em>considering </em>the matter; after that consideration the Department might choose to adopt the proposal or to withdraw it.  As it turned out, the Department did withdraw the proposal for special treatment of employees of \xe2\x80\x9ccovered enterprises.\xe2\x80\x9d  The result was a determination that exempted <em>all</em> third-party-employed companionship workers from the Act.  We do not understand why such a possibility was not reasonably foreseeable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Arizona Public Serv. Co.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d 1280, 1299\xe2\x80\x931300 (CADC 2000) (notice sufficient where agency first proposed that Indian tribes be required to meet the \xe2\x80\x9csame requirements\xe2\x80\x9d as States with respect to judicial review of Clean Air Act permitting actions, but then adopted a final rule that exempted tribes from certain, though not all, requirements), cert. denied <em>sub nom.

The agency said that it had \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that these exemptions can be available to such third party employers\xe2\x80\x9d because that interpretation is \xe2\x80\x9cmore consistent\xe2\x80\x9d with statutory language that refers to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any employee\xe2\x80\x99 engaged \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99 the enumerated services\xe2\x80\x9d and with \xe2\x80\x9cprior practices concerning other similarly worded exemptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 Fed. Reg. 7405.  There is no indication that anyone objected to this explanation at the time.  And more than 30 years later it remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation.

If so, she simply repeats in different form arguments that we have already considered and rejected.
