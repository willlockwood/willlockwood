S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1), and defines \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca person \xe2\x80\xa6 who has fifteen or more employees,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e(b).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision empowers federal courts to adjudicate civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cbrought under\xe2\x80\x9d Title VII.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3).  Title VII actions also fit within the Judicial Code\xe2\x80\x99s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to federal courts over actions \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  At the time Title VII was enacted, \xc2\xa71331 contained a $10,000 amount-in-controversy threshold, which left Title VII claims below that amount uncovered.  Section 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3) assured that the amount-in-controversy limitation would not impede a Title VII complainant\xe2\x80\x99s access to a federal forum.  Since 1980, when Congress amended \xc2\xa71331 to eliminate the amount-in-controversy threshold, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3) has served simply to underscore Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention to provide a federal forum for Title VII claims.  Because Congress has also authorized federal courts to exercise \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over state-law claims linked to a federal claim, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367, Title VII plaintiffs may pursue complete relief in federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1), may be raised at any stage in the litigation, even after trial and the entry of judgment, Rule 12(h)(3).  See <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U. S. 443</a>, 455.  By contrast, the objection that a complaint \xe2\x80\x9cfail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 12(b)(6), endures only up to, not beyond, trial on the merits, Rule 12(h)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Arbaugh sued her former employer, respondent Y&amp;H Corporation, in Federal District Court, charging sexual harassment in violation of Title VII and asserting related state-law claims.  The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for Arbaugh.  After the court entered judgment on that verdict, Y&amp;H moved to dismiss the entire action for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting, for the first time, that it had fewer than 15 employees on its payroll and therefore was not amenable to suit under Title VII.  Although recognizing the unfairness and waste of judicial resources that granting the motion would entail, the District Court, citing Federal Rule 12(h)(3), considered itself obliged to do so because it believed the 15-or-more-employees requirement to be jurisdictional.  It therefore vacated its prior judgment and dismissed Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s Title VII claim with prejudice and her state-law claims without prejudice.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed based on its precedent holding that unless the employee-numerosity requirement is met, federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction does not exist.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s numerical threshold does not circumscribe federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  Instead, the employee-numerosity requirement relates to the substantive adequacy of Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s Title VII claim, and therefore could not be raised defensively late in the lawsuit, <em>i.e.</em>, after Y&amp;H had failed to assert the objection prior to the close of trial on the merits.  The basic statutory grants of federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction are contained in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331, which provides for \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal-question\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, and \xc2\xa71332, which provides for \xe2\x80\x9c[d]iversity of citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  A plaintiff properly invokes \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction when she pleads a colorable claim \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Constitution or laws.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U. S. 678</a>, 681\xe2\x80\x93685.  She invokes \xc2\xa71332 jurisdiction when she presents a claim between parties of diverse citizenship that exceeds the required jurisdictional amount, currently $75,000.  See \xc2\xa71332(a).  Arbaugh invoked federal-question jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71331, but her case \xe2\x80\x9caris[es]\xe2\x80\x9d under a federal law, Title VII, that specifies, as a prerequisite to its application, the existence of a particular fact, <em>i.e.</em>, 15 or more employees.  The Court resolves the question whether that fact is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d or relates to the \xe2\x80\x9cmerits\xe2\x80\x9d of a Title VII claim mindful of the consequences of typing the 15-employee threshold a determinant of subject-matter jurisdiction, rather than an element of Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief.  First, \xe2\x80\x9csubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves the court\xe2\x80\x99s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cotton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/625/index.html">535 U. S. 625</a>, 630.  Moreover, courts, including this Court, have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.  <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 583.  Nothing in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s text indicates that Congress intended courts, on their own motion, to assure that the employee-numerosity requirement is met.  Second, in some instances, if subject-matter jurisdiction turns on contested facts, the trial judge may be authorized to review the evidence and resolve the dispute on her own.  If satisfaction of an essential element of a claim is at issue, however, the jury is the proper trier of contested facts.  <em>Reeves</em> v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/133/index.html">530 U. S. 133</a>, 150\xe2\x80\x93151.  Third, when a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.  Thus, the trial court below dismissed, along with the Title VII claim, pendent state-law claims fully tried by a jury and determined on the merits.  In contrast, when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to \xc2\xa71367, over pendent state-law claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Congress could make the employee-numerosity requirement \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d if it so chose, neither \xc2\xa71331 nor Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3), specifies any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s monetary floor.  Instead, the 15-employee threshold appears in a separate provision that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 394.  Given the unfairness and waste of judicial resources entailed in tying the employee-numerosity requirement to subject-matter jurisdiction, the sounder course is to refrain from constricting \xc2\xa71331 or \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3), and to leave the ball in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 court.  If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.  But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.  Applying that readily administrable bright line here yields the holding that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s 15-employee threshold is an element of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cfor an employer . . . to discriminate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>inter alia</em>, on the basis of sex.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision empowers federal courts to adjudicate civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cbrought under\xe2\x80\x9d Title VII.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3).  Covering a broader field, the Judicial Code gives federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all civil actions \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the laws of the United States.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  Title VII actions fit that description.  In a provision defining 13 terms used in Title VII, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e, Congress limited the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d to include only those having \xe2\x80\x9cfifteen or more employees,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e(b).  The question here presented is whether the numerical qualification contained in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d affects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, instead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII claim for relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question arises in this context.  Jenifer Arbaugh, plaintiff below, petitioner here, brought a Title VII action in federal court against her former employer, defendant-respondent Y&amp;H Corporation (hereinafter Y&amp;H), charging sexual harassment.  The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for Arbaugh in the total amount of $40,000.  Two weeks after the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict, Y&amp;H moved to dismiss the entire action for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  For the first time in the litigation, Y&amp;H asserted that it had fewer than 15 employees on its payroll and therefore was not amenable to suit under Title VII.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although recognizing that it was \xe2\x80\x9cunfair and a waste of judicial resources\xe2\x80\x9d to grant the motion to dismiss, App. to Pet. for Cert. 47, the trial court considered itself obliged to do so because it believed that the 15-or-more-employees requirement was jurisdictional.  We reject that categorization and hold that the numerical threshold does not circumscribe federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  Instead, the employee-numerosity requirement relates to the substantive adequacy of Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s Title VII claim, and therefore could not be raised defensively late in the lawsuit, <em>i.e.</em>, after Y&amp;H had failed to assert the objection prior to the close of trial on the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We set out below statutory provisions and rules that bear on this case.  Title VII makes it \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice for an employer \xe2\x80\xa6 to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  To spare very small businesses from Title VII liability, Congress provided that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98employer\xe2\x80\x99 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such a person \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">\nThis employee-numerosity requirement[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] appears in a section headed \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e, which also prescribes the meaning, for Title VII purposes, of 12 other terms used in the Act.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has broadly authorized the federal courts to exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  Title VII surely is a \xe2\x80\x9cla[w] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In 1964, however, when Title VII was enacted, \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella provision for federal-question jurisdiction contained an amount-in-controversy limitation: Claims could not be brought under \xc2\xa71331 unless the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000.  See \xc2\xa71331(a) (1964 ed.).  Title VII, framed in that light, assured that the amount-in-controversy limitation would not impede an employment-discrimination complainant\xe2\x80\x99s access to a federal forum.  The Act thus contains its own jurisdiction-conferring provision, which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cEach United States district court and each United States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nCongress amended 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 in 1980 to eliminate the amount-in-controversy threshold.  See Federal Question Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, \xc2\xa72, 94 Stat. 2369.  Since that time, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s own jurisdictional provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3), has served simply to underscore Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intention to provide a federal forum for the adjudication of Title VII claims.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note, too, that, under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367, federal courts may exercise \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over state-law claims linked to a claim based on federal law.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Plaintiffs suing under Title VII may avail themselves of the opportunity \xc2\xa71367 provides to pursue complete relief in a federal-court lawsuit.  Arbaugh did so in the instant case by adding to her federal complaint pendent claims arising under state law that would not independently qualify for federal-court adjudication.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1), may be raised by a party, or by a court on its own initiative, at any stage in the litigation, even after trial and the entry of judgment.  Rule 12(h)(3) instructs: \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U. S. 443</a>, 455 (2004).  By contrast, the objection that a complaint \xe2\x80\x9cfail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 12(b)(6), may not be asserted post trial.  Under Rule 12(h)(2), that objection endures up to, but not beyond, trial on the merits: \xe2\x80\x9cA defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \xe2\x80\xa6 may be made in any pleading \xe2\x80\xa6 or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.

Arbaugh alleged that Yalcin Hatipoglu, one of the company\xe2\x80\x99s owners, sexually harassed her and precipitated her constructive discharge.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In November 2001, Arbaugh filed suit against Y&amp;H in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Her complaint asserted claims under Title VII and Louisiana law.

Y&amp;H\xe2\x80\x99s responsive pleadings admitted Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d allegations but denied her contentions on the merits.  <em>Id</em>., Doc. 4, p.\xc2\xa01 (Answer to Complaint).  The pretrial order submitted and signed by the parties, and later subscribed by the presiding judge, reiterated that the court was \xe2\x80\x9cvested with jurisdiction over [Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s Title VII claim] pursuant to 28 U.

It did not list among \xe2\x80\x9cContested Issues of Fact\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cContested Legal Issues\xe2\x80\x9d the question whether Y&amp;H had the requisite number of employees under 42 U.

Nor was the issue raised at any other point pretrial or at trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties consented to trial before a Magistrate Judge.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7636(c).  After a two-day trial, the jury found that Arbaugh had been sexually harassed and constructively discharged in violation of Title VII and Louisiana antidiscrimination law.  The verdict awarded Arbaugh $5,000 in backpay, $5,000 in compensatory damages, and $30,000 in punitive damages.  The trial court entered judgment for Arbaugh on November 5, 2002.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two weeks later, Y&amp;H filed a motion under Federal Rule 12(h)(3) to dismiss Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Record, Doc. 44.  As sole ground for the motion, Y&amp;H alleged, for the first time in the proceedings, that it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not employ fifteen or more employees [during the relevant period] and thus is not an employer for Title VII purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, p.\xc2\xa02 (Memorandum in Support of Rule 12(h)(3) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction).  The trial court commented that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is unfair and a waste of judicial resources to permit [Y&amp;H] to admit Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of jurisdiction, try the case for two days and then assert a lack of subject matter jurisdiction in response to an adverse jury verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47.  Nevertheless, reciting the text of Rule 12(h)(3), see <em>supra</em>, at 5, the trial court allowed Y&amp;H to plead that it did not qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s definition of that term.

The dispute over the employee count turned on the employment status of Y&amp;H\xe2\x80\x99s eight drivers, engaged to make deliveries for the restaurant, and the company\xe2\x80\x99s four owners (the Moonlight Cafe\xe2\x80\x99s two managers and their shareholder spouses).  As the trial court noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f either the delivery drivers or the four owners are counted with the persons shown on the payroll journals, then Y&amp;H employed fifteen or more persons for the requisite time.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 27.  After reviewing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, however, the trial court concluded that neither the delivery drivers nor the owner-managers nor their shareholder spouses qualified as \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d for Title VII purposes.  <em>Id</em>., at 32\xe2\x80\x9343.

Dismissal for want of subject-matter jurisdiction was proper, the Court of Appeals ruled, for the record warranted the conclusion that Y&amp;H\xe2\x80\x99s delivery drivers, its owner-managers, and their shareholder wives were not \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d for Title VII purposes, 380 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 225\xe2\x80\x93230, and it was undisputed that Y&amp;H \xe2\x80\x9cdid not employ the requisite 15 employees without the inclusion of\xe2\x80\x9d those persons, <em>id.</em>, at 231.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/1031/index.html">544 U.

If the limitation conditions subject-matter jurisdiction, as the lower courts held it did, then a conclusion that Y&amp;H had fewer than 15 employees would require erasure of the judgment for Arbaugh entered on the jury verdict.  But if the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 subject-matter jurisdiction characterization is incorrect, and the issue, instead, concerns the merits of Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s case, then Y&amp;H raised the employee-numerosity requirement too late.  Its pretrial stipulations, see <em>supra</em>, at 6, and its failure to speak to the issue prior to the conclusion of the trial on the merits, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(2), <em>supra</em>, at 5, would preclude vacation of the $40,000 judgment in Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the subject-matter jurisdiction/ingredient-of-claim-for-relief dichotomy, this Court and others have been less than meticulous.  \xe2\x80\x9cSubject matter jurisdiction in federal-question cases is sometimes erroneously conflated with a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s need and ability to prove the defendant bound by the federal law asserted as the predicate for relief\xe2\x80\x94a merits-related determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 J.

Judicial opinions, the Second Circuit incisively observed, \xe2\x80\x9coften obscure the issue by stating that the court is dismissing \xe2\x80\x98for lack of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 when some threshold fact has not been established, without explicitly considering whether the dismissal should be for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Da Silva</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 361.  We have described such unrefined dispositions as \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings\xe2\x80\x9d that should be accorded \xe2\x80\x9cno precedential effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the question whether the federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in suit.  <em>Steel Co.</em>, 523 U.

S. 244</a> (1991).  <em>Hishon </em>involved a Title VII claim brought by a lawyer denied partnership in a law firm.  The District Court ruled that Title VII did not apply to the selection of partners and dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.  We noted that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] clear that it dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint on the ground that her allegations did not state a claim cognizable under Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  467 U. S., at 73, n.\xc2\xa02.  Disagreeing with the lower courts, we held that Title VII applies to partnership decisions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 73\xe2\x80\x9378.  That holding, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] it unnecessary to consider the wisdom of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of Rule 12(b)(1), as opposed to Rule 12(b)(6).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 73, n.\xc2\xa02.  The former Rule concerns subject-matter jurisdiction, the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Our opinion in <em>Hishon</em> thus raised, but did not decide, the question whether subject-matter jurisdiction was the proper rubric for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em>, we affirmed the judgment of the courts below that Title VII, as then composed, did not apply to a suit by a United States employee working abroad for a United States employer.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  That judgment had been placed under a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction label.  We agreed with the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 view of the limited geographical reach of the statute.  499 U.

But our decision did not turn on that characterization, and the parties did not cross swords over it.  See <em>Steel Co.</em>, 523 U. S., at 91 (declining to follow a decision treating an issue as jurisdictional because nothing \xe2\x80\x9c<em>turned upon</em> whether [the issue] was technically jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d in that case).  In short, we were not prompted in <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em> to home in on whether the dismissal had been properly based on the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction rather than on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s failure to state a claim.  499 U. S., at 247.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic statutory grants of federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction are contained in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71331 and 1332.  Section 1331 provides for \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ederal-question\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, \xc2\xa71332 for \xe2\x80\x9c[d]iversity of citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  A plaintiff properly invokes \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction when she pleads a colorable claim \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution or laws of the United States.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U. S. 678</a>, 681\xe2\x80\x93685 (1946).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  She invokes \xc2\xa71332 jurisdiction when she presents a claim between parties of diverse citizenship that exceeds the required jurisdictional amount, currently $75,000.  See \xc2\xa71332(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arbaugh invoked federal-question jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71331, but her case \xe2\x80\x9caris[es]\xe2\x80\x9d under a federal law, Title VII, that specifies, as a prerequisite to its application, the existence of a particular fact, <em>i.e.</em>, 15 or more employees.  We resolve the question whether that fact is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d or relates to the \xe2\x80\x9cmerits\xe2\x80\x9d of a Title VII claim mindful of the consequences of typing the 15-employee threshold a determinant of subject-matter jurisdiction, rather than an element of Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xe2\x80\x9csubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves the court\xe2\x80\x99s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cotton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/625/index.html">535 U. S. 625</a>, 630 (2002).  Moreover, courts, including this Court, have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.  <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 583 (1999).  Nothing in the text of Title VII indicates that Congress intended courts, on their own motion, to assure that the employee-numerosity requirement is met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in some instances, if subject-matter jurisdiction turns on contested facts, the trial judge may be authorized to review the evidence and resolve the dispute on her own.  See 5B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71350, pp. 243\xe2\x80\x93249 (3d ed. 2004); 2 Moore \xc2\xa712.30[3], pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9337 to 12\xe2\x80\x9338.  If satisfaction of an essential element of a claim for relief is at issue, however, the jury is the proper trier of contested facts.  <em>Reeves</em> v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/133/index.html">530 U. S. 133</a>, 150\xe2\x80\x93151 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, when a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the complaint in its entirety.  See 16 Moore \xc2\xa7106.66[1], pp. 106\xe2\x80\x9388 to 106\xe2\x80\x9389.  Thus in the instant case, the trial court dismissed, along with the Title VII claim, pendent state-law claims, see <em>supra</em>, at 4, fully tried by a jury and determined on the merits, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 23, 47.  In contrast, when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367, over pendent state-law claims.  See 16 Moore \xc2\xa7106.66[1], pp. 106\xe2\x80\x9386 to 106\xe2\x80\x9389.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, Congress could make the employee-numerosity requirement \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d just as it has made an amount-in-controversy threshold an ingredient of subject-matter jurisdiction in delineating diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.  But neither \xc2\xa71331, nor Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3) (authorizing jurisdiction over actions \xe2\x80\x9cbrought under\xe2\x80\x9d Title VII), specifies any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s monetary floor.  Instead, the 15-employee threshold appears in a separate provision that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 394 (1982).  Given the \xe2\x80\x9cunfair[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwaste of judicial resources,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 47, entailed in tying the employee-numerosity requirement to subject-matter jurisdiction, we think it the sounder course to refrain from constricting \xc2\xa71331 or Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(3), and to leave the ball in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 court.  If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope shall count as jurisdictional,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.  See <em>Da Silva</em>, 229 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 361 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether a disputed matter concerns jurisdiction or the merits (or occasionally both) is sometimes a close question.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.  Applying that readily administrable bright line to this case, we hold that the threshold number of employees for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The same provision further states that the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d does not include the United States, corporations wholly owned by the United States, Indian Tribes, certain departments and agencies of the District of Columbia, or tax-exempt \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide private membership club[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (other than labor organizations).  \xc2\xa72000e(b).  </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Congress originally prescribed a 25-or-more-employee threshold, Civil Rights Act of 1964, \xc2\xa7701, 78 Stat. 253, but lowered the minimum number of employees to 15 in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, \xc2\xa72, 86 Stat. 103.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The other terms defined in \xc2\xa72000e are: \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cemployment agency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clabor organization,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cemployee,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cindustry affecting commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cState,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creligion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of sex,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining party,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrates,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crespondent.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Title VII contains a separate jurisdictional provision, 42 U.

Arbaugh\xe2\x80\x99s case surely does not belong in that category.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Congress has exercised its prerogative to restrict the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal district courts based on a wide variety of factors, some of them also relevant to the merits of a case.  Certain statutes confer subject-matter jurisdiction only for actions brought by specific plaintiffs, <em>e.g</em>., 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71345 (United States and its agencies and officers), 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa724301(<em>l</em>)(2) (Amtrak), or for claims against particular defendants, <em>e.g</em>., 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72707(e)(3) (persons subject to orders of the Egg Board); 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71348 (national banking associations), or for actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds, <em>e.g</em>., 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7814, or falls below, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76713(a)(1)(B), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(2), a stated amount.  Other jurisdiction-conferring provisions describe particular types of claims.  See, <em>e.g</em>., \xc2\xa71339 (\xe2\x80\x9cany civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to the postal service\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71347 (\xe2\x80\x9cany civil action commenced by any tenant in common or joint tenant for the partition of lands where the United States is one of the tenants in common or joint tenants\xe2\x80\x9d).  In a few instances, Congress has enacted a separate provision that expressly restricts application of a jurisdiction-conferring statute.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Salfi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/749/index.html">422 U. S. 749</a>, 756\xe2\x80\x93761 (1975) (42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7405(h) bars \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction over suits to recover Social Security benefits).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
