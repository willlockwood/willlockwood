S. 275</a></p><p> employers to provide leave and reinstatement to employees disabled by pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>California\'s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal.Gov\'t Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 12900 <em>et seq.</em> (West 1980 and Supp. 1986), is a comprehensive statute that prohibits discrimination in employment and housing.  In September, 1978, California amended the FEHA to proscribe certain forms of employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.  <em>See</em> Cal. Labor Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1420.35, 1978 Cal.Stats., ch. 1321, \xc2\xa7 1, pp. 4320-4322 (West Supp. 1979), <em>now codified at</em> Cal.Gov\'t Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) (West 1980). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Subdivision (b)(2) -- the provision at issue here -- is the only portion of the statute that applies to employers subject to Title VII.  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="276">Page 479 U. S. 276</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 12945(e). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It requires these employers to provide female employees an unpaid pregnancy disability leave of up to four months.  Respondent Fair Employment and Housing Commission, the state agency authorized to interpret the FEHA, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] has construed \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) to require California employers to reinstate an employee returning from such pregnancy leave to the job she previously held, unless it is no longer available due to business necessity.  In the latter case, the employer must make a reasonable, good faith effort to place the employee in a substantially similar job. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The statute does not compel employers to provide paid leave to pregnant employees.  Accordingly, the only benefit pregnant workers actually derive from \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) is a qualified right to reinstatement.</p>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e <em>et seq.,</em> also prohibits various forms of employment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 479 U. S. 277</a></p><p> discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sex.  However, in <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/case.html">429 U. S. 125</a></span> (1976), this Court ruled that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not sex discrimination under Title VII. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In response to the <em>Gilbert</em> decision, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e(k).  The PDA specifies that sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 479 U. S. 278</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association (Cal Fed) is a federally chartered savings and loan association based in Los Angeles; it is an employer covered by both Title VII and \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2).  Cal Fed has a facially neutral leave policy that permits employees who have completed three months of service to take unpaid leaves of absence for a variety of reasons, including disability and pregnancy.  Although it is Cal Fed\'s policy to try to provide an employee taking unpaid leave with a similar position upon</p>\n<p>returning, Cal Fed expressly reserves the right to terminate an employee who has taken a leave of absence if a similar position is not available.</p>\n<p>Lillian Garland was employed by Cal Fed as a receptionist for several years.  In January, 1982, she took a pregnancy disability leave.  When she was able to return to work in April of that year, Garland notified Cal Fed, but was informed that her job had been filled and that there were no receptionist or similar positions available.  Garland filed a complaint with respondent Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which issued an administrative accusation against Cal Fed on her behalf. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Respondent charged Cal Fed with violating \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) of the FEHA.  Prior to the scheduled hearing before respondent Fair Employment and Housing Commission, Cal Fed, joined by petitioners Merchants and Manufacturers Association and the California Chamber of Commerce, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] brought this action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="279">Page 479 U. S. 279</a></p><p> They sought a declaration that \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) is inconsistent with and preempted by Title VII and an injunction against enforcement of the section. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The District Court granted petitioners\' motion for summary judgment.  33 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,227, p. 32781, 34 FEP Cases 562 (1984).  Citing <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/case.html">462 U. S. 669</a></span> (1983), [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the court stated that</p>\n<p>"California employers who comply with state law are subject to reverse discrimination suits under Title VII brought by temporarily disabled males who do not receive the same treatment as female employees disabled by pregnancy. . . ."</p>\n<p>34 FEP Cases at 568.  On this basis, the District Court held that</p>\n<p>"California state law and the policies of interpretation and enforcement . . . which require preferential treatment of female employees disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions are preempted by Title VII and are null, void, invalid and inoperative under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="280">Page 479 U. S. 280</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  758 F.2d 390 (1985).  It held that</p>\n<p>"the district court\'s conclusion that section 12945(b)(2) discriminates against men on the basis of pregnancy defies common sense, misinterprets case law, and flouts Title VII and the PDA."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 393 (footnote omitted).  Based on its own reading of <em>Newport News,</em> the Court of Appeals found that the PDA does not "demand that state law be blind to pregnancy\'s existence."  758 F.2d at 395.  The court held that, in enacting the PDA, Congress intended "to construct a floor beneath which pregnancy disability benefits may not drop -- not a ceiling above which they may not rise."  <em>Id.</em> at 396.  Because it found that the California statute furthers the goal of equal employment opportunity for women, the Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<p>"Title VII does not preempt a state law that guarantees pregnant women a certain number of pregnancy disability leave days, because this is neither inconsistent with, nor unlawful under, Title VII."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 474 U.S. 1049 (1986), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In determining whether a state statute is preempted by federal law and therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, our sole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress.  <em>See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html">463 U. S. 85</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#95">463 U. S. 95</a></span> (1983); <em>Malone v. White Motor Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/497/case.html">435 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/497/case.html#504">435 U. S. 504</a></span> (1978).  Federal law may supersede state law in several different ways.  First, when acting within constitutional limits, Congress is empowered to preempt state law by so stating in express terms.  <em>E.g., Jones v. Rath Packing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html">430 U. S. 519</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#525">430 U. S. 525</a></span> (1977).  Second, congressional intent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 479 U. S. 281</a></p><p> to preempt state law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress "left no room" for supplementary state regulation.  <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html#230">331 U. S. 230</a></span> (1947).  Neither of these bases for preemption exists in this case.  Congress has explicitly disclaimed any intent categorically to preempt state law or to "occupy the field" of employment discrimination law.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e-7 and 2000h-4.</p>\n<p>As a third alternative, in those areas where Congress has not completely displaced state regulation, federal law may nonetheless preempt state law to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law.  Such a conflict occurs either because "compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility," <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U. S. 142</a></span>-143 (1963), or because the state law stands "as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."  <em>Hines v.

In two sections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 708 and 1104, Congress has indicated that state laws will be preempted only if they actually conflict with federal law.  Section 708 of Title VII provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this title shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 479 U.

Section 1104 of Title XI, applicable to all titles of the Civil Rights Act, establishes the following standard for preemption:</p>\n<p>"Nothing contained in any title of this Act shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress to occupy the field in which any such title operates to the exclusion of State laws on the same subject matter, nor shall any provision of this Act be construed as invalidating any provision of State law unless such provision is inconsistent with any of the purposes of this Act, or any provision thereof."</p>\n<p>78 Stat. 268, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000h-4.  Accordingly, there is no need to infer congressional intent to preempt state laws from the substantive provisions of Title VII; these two sections provide a "reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state authority" to regulate employment practice.  <em>Malone v.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Accordingly, subject to certain limitations, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] we agree with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 479 U. S. 286</a></p><p> intended the PDA to be "a floor beneath which pregnancy disability benefits may not drop -- not a ceiling above which they may not rise."  758 F.2d at 396.</p>\n<p>The context in which Congress considered the issue of pregnancy discrimination supports this view of the PDA.  Congress had before it extensive evidence of discrimination against pregnancy, particularly in disability and health insurance programs like those challenged in <em>Gilbert and Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/136/case.html">434 U. S. 136</a></span> (1977). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The Reports, debates, and hearings make abundantly clear that Congress intended the PDA to provide relief for working women and to end discrimination against pregnant workers. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  In contrast to the thorough account of discrimination against pregnant workers, the legislative history is devoid of any discussion of preferential treatment of pregnancy, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] beyond acknowledgments of the existence of state statutes providing for such preferential treatment.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#287">479 U. S. 287</a></span>.  Opposition to the PDA came from those concerned with the cost of including pregnancy in health and disability-benefit plans and the application of the bill to abortion, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] not from those who favored special accommodation of pregnancy.</p>\n<p>In support of their argument that the PDA prohibits employment practices that favor pregnant women, petitioners and several <em>amici</em> cite statements in the legislative history to the effect that the PDA does not <em>require</em> employers to extend any benefits to pregnant women that they do not already provide to other disabled employees.  For example, the House Report explained that the proposed legislation</p>\n<p>"does not require </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 479 U. S. 287</a></p><p> employers to treat pregnant employees in any particular manner. . . .  H.R. 6075 in no way requires the institution of any new programs where none currently exists. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]"</p>\n<p>We do not interpret these references to support petitioners\' construction of the statute.  On the contrary, if Congress had intended to <em>prohibit</em> preferential treatment, it would have been the height of understatement to say only that the legislation would not <em>require</em> such conduct.  It is hardly conceivable that Congress would have extensively discussed only its intent not to require preferential treatment if, in fact, it had intended to prohibit such treatment.</p>\n<p>We also find it significant that Congress was aware of state laws similar to California\'s, but apparently did not consider them inconsistent with the PDA.  In the debates and Reports on the bill, Congress repeatedly acknowledged the existence of state antidiscrimination laws that prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Two of the States mentioned then required employers to provide reasonable leave to pregnant workers. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]   After citing these state laws, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="288">Page 479 U.

By requiring employers to reinstate women after a reasonable pregnancy disability leave, \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) ensures that they will not lose their jobs on account of pregnancy disability. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  California\'s approach is consistent with the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE BRENNAN in <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,</em> which Congress adopted in enacting the PDA.  Referring to <em>Lau v. Nichols,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/563/case.html">414 U. S. 563</a></span> (1974), a Title VI decision, JUSTICE BRENNAN stated:</p>\n<p>"[D]iscrimination is a social phenomenon encased in a social context and, therefore, unavoidably takes its meaning from the desired end products of the relevant legislative enactment, end products that may demand due consideration of the uniqueness of the \'disadvantaged\' individuals.  A realistic understanding of conditions found in today\'s labor environment warrants taking pregnancy into account in fashioning disability policies."</p>\n<p>429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/case.html#159">429 U.

By "taking pregnancy into account," California\'s pregnancy disability leave statute allows women, as well as men, to have families without losing their jobs. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 479 U. S. 290</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We emphasize the limited nature of the benefits \xc2\xa7 12945 (b)(2) provides.  The statute is narrowly drawn to cover only the period of <em>actual physical disability</em> on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.  Accordingly, unlike the protective labor legislation prevalent earlier in this century, [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) does not reflect archaic or stereotypical notions about pregnancy and the abilities of pregnant workers.  A statute based on such stereotypical assumptions would, of course, be inconsistent with Title VII\'s goal of equal employment opportunity.  <em>See, e.g., Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v.

[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  Section 12945(b)(2) does not prevent employers from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 479 U.

This is not a case where "compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility," <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  Section 12945(b)(2) does not compel California employers to treat pregnant workers better than other disabled employees; it merely establishes benefits that employers must, at a minimum, provide to pregnant workers.  Employers are free to give comparable benefits to other disabled employees, thereby treating "women affected by pregnancy" no better than "other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work."  Indeed, at oral argument, petitioners conceded that compliance with both statutes "is theoretically possible."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that "extension" of the state statute to cover other employees would be inappropriate in the absence of a clear indication that this is what the California Legislature intended.  They cite cases in which this Court has declined to rewrite under-inclusive state statutes found to violate the Equal Protection Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Wengler v.

Of course, since the PDA does not itself prohibit different treatment, it certainly does not require the States to do so.  Moreover, if we were to interpret the term "permit" as expansively as petitioners suggest, the State would be required to incorporate every prohibition contained in Title VII into its state law, since it would otherwise be held to "permit" any employer action it did not expressly prohibit.  We conclude that "permit" in \xc2\xa7 708 must be interpreted to preempt only those state laws that expressly sanction a practice unlawful under Title VII; the term does not preempt state laws that are silent on the practice.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, Congress and the California Legislature were each aware in general terms of the regulatory scheme adopted by the other when they enacted their legislation.

Congress was aware that some state laws mandated certain benefits for pregnant workers, but did not indicate that they would be preempted by federal law.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#287">479 U.

As JUSTICE WHITE recognizes in his dissent, Congress did not intend to "put pregnancy in a class by itself within Title VII," and the enactment of the PDA "did not mark a departure from Title VII principles."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#298">479 U.

But this realization does not lead me to support JUSTICE WHITE\'S position; rather, I believe that the PDA\'s posture as part of Title VII compels rejection of his argument that the PDA mandates complete neutrality and forbids all beneficial treatment of pregnancy.

S. 193</a></span> (1979), the Court rejected the argument that Title VII prohibits all preferential treatment of the disadvantaged classes that the statute was enacted to protect.  The plain words of Title VII, which would have led to a contrary result, were read in the context of the statute\'s enactment and its purposes. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  In this case as well, the language of the Act seems to mandate treating pregnant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 479 U. S. 294</a></p><p> employees the same as other employees.  I cannot, however, ignore the fact that the PDA is a definitional section of Title VII\'s prohibition against gender-based discrimination.  Had <em>Weber</em> interpreted Title VII as requiring neutrality, I would agree with JUSTICE WHITE that the PDA should be interpreted that way as well.  But since the Court in <em>Weber</em> interpreted Title VII to draw a distinction between discrimination against members of the protected class and special preference in favor of members of that class, I do not accept the proposition that the PDA requires absolute neutrality.</p>\n<p>I therefore conclude that JUSTICE MARSHALL\'S view, which holds that the PDA allows some preferential treatment of pregnancy, is more consistent with our interpretation of Title VII than JUSTICE WHITE\'S view is.  This is not to say, however, that all preferential treatment of pregnancy is automatically beyond the scope of the PDA. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Rather, as with other parts of Title VII, preferential treatment of the disadvantaged class is only permissible so long as it is consistent with "accomplish[ing] the goal that Congress designed Title VII to achieve."  <em>Weber, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/193/case.html#204">443 U.

Thus, I agree that a California employer would not violate the PDA were it to comply with California\'s statute without affording the same protection to men suffering somewhat similar disabilities.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Because I agree with the Court that the California statute does not conflict with the purposes of the PDA and does not purport to "require or permit" action inconsistent with the PDA, I do not reach the question whether \xc2\xa7 1104 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000h-4, is applicable to Title VII, or whether, as JUSTICE SCALIA suggests, \xc2\xa7 708, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-7, is the only provision governing Title VII\'s preemptive scope.  Even if \xc2\xa7 1104 applies, the California statute would not be preempted in this case.  Since Part III-A of JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s opinion does not make clear whether it decides this issue or whether it only assumes for the purposes of the decision that \xc2\xa7 1104 applies, I do not join that section.  I do, however, join the remainder of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>The choice between disposing of the case through interpreting the preemption provisions of Title VII and Title XI, as JUSTICE SCALIA does, or through interpreting the substance of the PDA, and thus obviating the need to decide the Title XI question, is a choice between two grounds of statutory construction.  Neither approach is inherently narrower than the other.  Given the value of having an opinion for the Court, I have therefore concluded that I should choose between the conflicting views of the PDA expressed by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE WHITE, even though JUSTICE SCALIA may be correct in arguing that this case could be decided without reaching that issue.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>There is a striking similarity between the evidence about the enactment of Title VII that was available in <em>Steelworkers v. Weber</em> and the evidence available regarding the enactment of the PDA.  First, the plain language in both cases points to neutrality, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#284">479 U.

S. 285</a></span>.  Second, in both cases the records are replete with indications that Congress\' goal was to bar discrimination against the disadvantaged class or classes at issue.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#285">479 U.

Third, in neither case was there persuasive evidence that Congress considered the ramifications of a rule mandating complete neutrality.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#286">479 U.

Finally, there were statements in the legislative histories of both provisions stressing that Congress did not intend to <em>require</em> preferential treatment, statements that undermine the conclusion that Congress indeed intended to <em>prohibit</em> such treatment.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#286">479 U.

Although the opinion does make some mention of the "floor" but "not a ceiling" language employed by the Court of Appeals, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#285">479 U.

Indeed, the Court of Appeals also subjected California\'s statute to the test of "whether the policy furthers <em>Title VII\'s prophylactic purpose of achieving "equality of employment opportunities."\'"  758 F.2d 390, 396 (1985) (quoting <em>EEOC v.

The factors discussed in <em>Weber</em> are, in my view, merely exemplary, and do not necessarily define the outer limits of what a private employer or a State may do to in an attempt to effectuate the goals of Title VII.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#289">479 U.

Although both that section and \xc2\xa7 1104, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000h-4, are described by the majority as preemption provisions, they are more precisely <em>anti-preemption</em> provisions, prescribing that nothing in Title VII (in the case of \xc2\xa7 708) and nothing in the entire Civil Rights Act (in the case of \xc2\xa7 1104) shall be deemed to preempt state law unless certain conditions are met.  The exceptions set forth in the general \xc2\xa7 1104 ban on preemption ("inconsisten[cy] with any of the purposes of this Act, or any provision thereof ") are somewhat broader than the single exception set forth in the Title VII \xc2\xa7 708 ban.  Because the Pregnancy Disability Act (PDA) is part of Title VII, the more expansive prohibition of preemption particularly applicable to that Title applies.  If that precludes preemption of Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) (West 1980), it is unnecessary to inquire whether \xc2\xa7 1104 would do so.</p>\n<p>Section 708 narrows the preemptive scope of the PDA so that it preempts only laws which "purpor[t] to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 479 U. S. 296</a></p><p> practice" under the Title. 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-7.  Thus, whether or not the PDA prohibits discriminatorily favorable disability treatment for pregnant women, \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) of the California Code cannot be preempted, since it does not remotely purport to require or permit any refusal to accord federally mandated equal treatment to others similarly situated.  No more is needed to decide this case.</p>\n<p>The majority not only ignores the clear anti-preemptive effect of \xc2\xa7 708, but, even proceeding on the basis of its more generalized preemption analysis, decides more than is necessary.  Its reasoning is essentially as follows:  It is consistent with the requirements and purposes of the PDA for a State to require special treatment for pregnancy disability (Part III-B); and besides, the state law here at issue does not require special treatment for pregnancy disability (Part III-C).  By parity of analysis, we can decide any issue, so long as the facts before us either do or do not present it.  There are proper occasions for alternative holdings, where one of the alternatives does not eliminate the jurisdictional predicate for the other -- though even in that situation the practice is more appropriate for lower courts than for this Court, whose first arrow runs no risk of being later adjudged to have missed its mark.  But where, as here, it is entirely clear that an issue of law is not presented by the facts of the case, it is beyond our jurisdiction to reach it.</p>\n<p>I am fully aware that it is more convenient for the employers of California and the California Legislature to have us interpret the PDA prematurely.  It has never been suggested, however, that the constitutional prohibition upon our rendering of advisory opinions is a doctrine of convenience.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the ground that \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) of the California Code does not purport to require or permit any act that would be an unlawful employment practice under any conceivable interpretation of the PDA, and therefore, by virtue of \xc2\xa7 708, cannot be preempted. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 479 U. S. 297</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court that Cal.Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) (West 1980) is not preempted by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), 92 Stat. 2076, <em>codified at</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e(k), and \xc2\xa7 708 of Title VII.  Section 703(a) of Title VII, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a), forbids discrimination in the terms of employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  The PDA gave added meaning to discrimination on the basis of sex:</p>\n<p>"The terms \'because of sex\' or \'on the basis of sex\' [in \xc2\xa7 703(a) of this Title] include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 2000e(k).</p>\n<p>The second clause quoted above could not be clearer:  it mandates that pregnant employees "shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes" as nonpregnant employees similarly situated with respect to their ability or inability to work.  This language leaves no room for preferential treatment of pregnant workers.  The majority would avoid its plain meaning by misapplying our interpretation of the clause in <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/case.html">462 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/669/case.html#678">462 U.

The second clause addresses only female employees, and was not directly implicated in <em>Newport News</em> because the pregnant persons at issue in that case were spouses of male employees.  We therefore stated in <em>Newport News</em> that the second clause had only explanatory or illustrative significance.  We did not indicate in any way, however, that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 479 U. S. 298</a></p><p> second clause does not mean exactly what it says in a situation where it is directly implicated.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the mandate of the PDA, California law requires every employer to have a disability leave policy for pregnancy even if it has none for any other disability.  An employer complies with California law if it has a leave policy for pregnancy but denies it for every other disability.  On its face, \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) is in square conflict with the PDA, and is therefore preempted.  Because the California law permits employers to single out pregnancy for preferential treatment, and therefore to violate Title VII, it is not saved by \xc2\xa7 708, which limits preemption of state laws to those that require or permit an employer to commit an unfair employment practice. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority nevertheless would save the California law on two grounds.  First, it holds that the PDA does not require disability from pregnancy to be treated the same as other disabilities; instead, it forbids less favorable, but permits more favorable, benefits for pregnancy disability.  The express command of the PDA is unambiguously to the contrary, and the legislative history casts no doubt on that mandate.</p>\n<p>The legislative materials reveal Congress\' plain intent not to put pregnancy in a class by itself within Title VII, as the majority does with its "floor . . . not a ceiling" approach.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#285">479 U. S. 285</a></span>.  The Senate Report clearly stated:</p>\n<p>"By defining sex discrimination to include discrimination against pregnant women, the bill rejects the view that employers may treat pregnancy and its incidents as <em>sui generis,</em> without regard to its functional comparability to other conditions.  Under this bill, the treatment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 479 U. S. 299</a></p><p> pregnant women in covered employment must focus not on their condition alone, but on the actual effects of that condition on their ability to work.  Pregnant women who are able to work must be permitted to work on the same conditions as other employees; and when they are not able to work for medical reasons, they must be accorded the same rights, leave privileges and other benefits, as other workers who are disabled from working. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]"</p>\n<p>The House Report similarly stressed that the legislation did not mark a departure from Title VII principles:</p>\n<p>"It must be emphasized that this legislation, <em>operating as part of Title VII,</em> prohibits only discriminatory treatment.  Therefore, it does not require employers to treat pregnant employees in any particular manner with respect to hiring, permitting them to continue working, providing sick leave, furnishing medical and hospital benefits, providing disability benefits, or any other matter.  H.R. 6075 in no way requires the institution of any new programs where none currently exist.  The bill would simply require that pregnant women be treated the same as other employees on the basis of their ability or inability to work. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 479 U. S. 300</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The majority correctly reports that Congress focused on discrimination against, rather than preferential treatment of, pregnant workers.  There is only one direct reference in the legislative history to preferential treatment.  Senator Brooke stated during the Senate debate:</p>\n<p>"I would emphasize most strongly that S. 995 in no way provides special disability benefits for working women.  They have not demanded, nor asked, for such benefits.  They have asked only to be treated with fairness, to be accorded the same employment rights as men. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]"</p>\n<p>Given the evidence before Congress of the widespread discrimination against pregnant workers, it is probable that most Members of Congress did not seriously consider the possibility that someone would want to afford preferential treatment to pregnant workers.  The parties and their <em>amici</em> argued vigorously to this Court the policy implications of preferential treatment of pregnant workers.  In favor of preferential treatment, it was urged with conviction that preferential treatment merely enables women, like men, to have children without losing their jobs.  In opposition to preferential treatment, it was urged with equal conviction that preferential treatment represents a resurgence of the 19th century protective legislation which perpetuated sex role stereotypes and which impeded women in their efforts to take their rightful place in the workplace.  <em>See, e.g., Muller v. Oregon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/412/case.html">208 U. S. 412</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/412/case.html#421">208 U.

It is not the place of this Court, however, to resolve this policy dispute.  Our task is to interpret Congress\' intent in enacting the PDA.  Congress\' silence in its consideration of the PDA with respect to preferential treatment of pregnant workers cannot fairly be interpreted to abrogate the plain statements in the legislative history, not to mention the language of the statute, that equality of treatment was to be the guiding principle of the PDA. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 479 U. S. 301</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Congress\' acknowledgment of state antidiscrimination laws does not support a contrary inference.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#287">479 U. S. 287</a></span>-288.  The most extensive discussion of state laws governing pregnancy discrimination is found in the House Report. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  It was reported that six States, Alaska, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Montana, and the District of Columbia specifically included pregnancy in their fair employment practices laws.  In 12 additional States, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin, the prohibition on sex discrimination in the state fair employment practices law had been interpreted, either by a state court or the state enforcement agency, to require equal treatment of pregnant workers.  Finally, five States, California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island, had included pregnancy in their temporary disability laws under which private employers are required to provide partial wage replacement for temporary disabilities.  The Report noted, however, that, whereas California, New Jersey, and New York covered complications from pregnancy on the same basis as other disabilities, California, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island set maximum limits on the coverage required for disability associated with normal childbirth.  The Report did not in any way set apart the Connecticut and Montana statutes, on which the majority relies, from the other state statutes.  The House Report gave no indication that these statutes required anything more than equal treatment.  Indeed, the state statutes were considered, not in the context of preemption, but in the context of a discussion of health insurance costs.  The House Report expressly stated:  "The significance of this State coverage" is that</p>\n<p>"many employers are <em>already</em> under a State law obligation to provide benefits to pregnant disabled workers.  Passage of the bill thus has little or no economic impact on such employers. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 479 U. S. 302</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nor does anything in the legislative history from the Senate side indicate that it carefully considered the state statutes, including those of Connecticut and Montana, and expressly endorsed their provisions.  The Senate Report noted that</p>\n<p>"25 States presently interpret their own fair employment practices laws to prohibit sex discrimination based on pregnancy and childbirth,"</p>\n<p>and Senator Williams presented during the Senate debate a list of States which required coverage for pregnancy and pregnancy-related disabilities, but there was no analysis of their provisions. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  The majority seems to interpret Senator Javits\' acknowledgment that several state legislatures, including New York, his own State, had mandated certain benefits for pregnant employees as an unqualified endorsement of those state statutes.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#287">479 U. S. 287</a></span>, n. 23.  Later, however, when pressed by Senator Hatch about the fact that the New York statute limited the required coverage of disability caused by pregnancy to eight weeks, Senator Javits had no hesitation in expressing his disagreement with the New York statute. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  Passing reference to state statutes without express recognition of their content and without express endorsement is insufficient in my view to override the PDA\'s clear equal treatment mandate, expressed both in the statute and its legislative history.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s second, and equally strange, ground is that, even if the PDA does prohibit special benefits for pregnant women, an employer may still comply with both the California law and the PDA:  it can adopt the specified leave policies for pregnancy, and at the same time afford similar benefits for all other disabilities.  This is untenable.  California surely had no intent to require employers to provide general disability leave benefits.  It intended to prefer pregnancy, and went no further.  Extension of these benefits to the entire workforce would be a dramatic increase in the scope of the state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 479 U. S. 303</a></p><p> law, and would impose a significantly greater burden on California employers.  That is the province of the California Legislature.  <em>See Wengler v.

Nor can \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) be saved by applying Title VII in tandem with it, such that employers would be required to afford reinstatement rights to pregnant workers as a matter of state law, but would be required to afford the same rights to all other workers as a matter of federal law.  The text of the PDA does not speak to this question, but it is clear from the legislative history that Congress did not intend for the PDA to impose such burdens on employers.  As recognized by the majority, opposition to the PDA came from those concerned with the cost of including pregnancy in health and disability benefit plans.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#286">479 U. S. 286</a></span>.  The House Report acknowledged these concerns, and explained that the bill "in no way requires the institution of any new programs where none currently exist." [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  The Senate Report gave a similar assurance. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  In addition, legislator after legislator stated during the floor debates that the PDA would not require an employer to institute a disability benefits program if it did not already have one in effect. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Congress intended employers to be free to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 479 U. S. 304</a></p><p> provide any level of disability benefits they wished -- or none at all -- as long as pregnancy was not a factor in allocating such benefits.  The conjunction of \xc2\xa7 12945(b)(2) and the PDA requires California employers to implement new minimum disability leave programs.  Reading the state and federal statutes together in this fashion yields a result which Congress expressly disavowed.</p>\n<p>In sum, preferential treatment of pregnant workers is prohibited by Title VII, as amended by the PDA.  Section 12945(b)(2) of the California Government Code, which extends preferential benefits for pregnancy, is therefore preempted.  It is not saved by \xc2\xa7 708, because it purports to authorize employers to commit an unfair employment practice forbidden by Title VII.

Brooke) ("[T]he bill being introduced would not mandate compulsory disability coverage"); 123 Cong.Rec. at 8145, Leg.Hist. 19 (remarks of Sen. Bayh) ("Under the provisions of our legislation, only those companies which already voluntarily offer disability coverage would be affected"); 123 Cong.Rec. at 10582, Leg.Hist. 25 (remarks of Rep. Hawkins) ("[A]n employer who does not now provide disability benefits to his employees will not have to provide such benefits to women disabled due to pregnancy or childbirth"); 123 Cong.Rec. at 29386, Leg.Hist. 64 (remarks of Sen. Williams) ("[T]his legislation does not require that any employer begin to provide health insurance where it is not presently provided"); 123 Cong.Rec. at 29388, Leg.Hist. 71 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) ("This amendment does not require all employers to provide disability insurance plans; it merely requires that employers who have disability plans for their employees treat pregnancy-related disabilities in the same fashion that all other temporary disabilities are treated with respect to benefits and leave policies"); 123 Cong.Rec. at 29663, Leg.Hist. 131 (remarks of Sen.

But if this is not a statute which "purports to . . . permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice" under Title VII, I do not know what such a statute would look like.  <em>See, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/272/case.html#290">479 U.
