JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Arizona has levied a tax of 2% on the "gross proceeds of sales, or gross income" of appellant Warren Trading Post Company, which does a retail trading business with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 380 U. S. 686</a></p><p> Indians on the Arizona part of the Navajo Indian Reservation under a license granted by the United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to 19 Stat. 200, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 261 (1958 ed.). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Appellant claimed that, as applied to its income from trading with reservation Indians on the reservation, the state tax was invalid as (1) in violation of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian Tribes"; (2) inconsistent with the comprehensive congressional plan, enacted under authority of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, to regulate Indian trade and traders and to have Indian tribes on reservations govern themselves.  The State Supreme Court rejected these contentions and upheld the tax, one Justice dissenting.  95 Ariz. 110, 387 P.2d 809.  The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2) (1958 ed.).  Since we hold that this state tax cannot be imposed consistently with federal statutes applicable to the Indians on the Navajo Reservation, we find it unnecessary to consider whether the tax is also barred by that part of the Commerce Clause giving Congress power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes.</p>\n<p>The Navajo Reservation was set apart as a "permanent home" for the Navajos in a treaty made with the "Navajo nation or tribe of Indians" on June 1, 1868. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Long before that, in fact from the very first days of our Government, the Federal Government had been permitting the Indians largely to govern themselves, free from state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 380 U.

In the very first volume of the federal statutes is found an Act, passed in 1790 by the first Congress, "to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes," requiring that Indian traders obtain a license from a federal official, and specifying in detail the conditions on which such licenses would be granted. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Such comprehensive federal regulation of Indian traders has continued from that day to this. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Existing statutes make specific restrictions on trade with the Indians, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 380 U. S. 689</a></p><p> one of them, passed in 1876 and tracing back to comprehensive enactments of 1802 [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and 1834, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] provides that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall have "the sole power and authority to appoint traders to the Indian tribes" and to specify "the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Acting under authority of this statute and one added in 1901, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the Commissioner has promulgated detailed regulations prescribing in the most minute fashion who may qualify to be a trader and how he shall be licensed; penalties for acting as a trader without a license; conditions under which government employees may trade with Indians; articles that cannot be sold to Indians; and conduct forbidden on a licensed trader\'s premises. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  He has ordered that detailed business records be kept, and that government officials be allowed to inspect these records to make sure that prices charged are fair and reasonable; that traders pay Indians in money; that bonds be executed by proposed licensees; and that the governing body of an Indian reservation may assess from a trader "such fees, etc., as it may deem appropriate." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 380 U. S. 690</a></p><p> It was under these comprehensive statutes and regulations that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs licensed appellant to trade with the Indians on the Navajo Reservation.  These apparently all-inclusive regulations and the statutes authorizing them would seem, in themselves, sufficient to show that Congress has taken the business of Indian trading on reservations so fully in hand that no room remains for state laws imposing additional burdens upon traders. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In fact, the Solicitor\'s Office of the Department of the Interior, in 1940 [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and again in 1943, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] interpreted these statutes to bar States from taxing federally licensed Indian traders on their sales to reservation Indians on a reservation.  We think those rulings were correct.</p>\n<p>Congress has, since the creation of the Navajo Reservation nearly a century ago, left the Indians on it largely free to run the reservation and its affairs without state control, a policy which has automatically relieved Arizona of all burdens for carrying on those same responsibilities.  And, in compliance with its treaty obligations, the Federal Government has provided for roads, education and other services needed by the Indians. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 380 U. S. 691</a></p><p> think the assessment and collection of this tax would, to a substantial extent, frustrate the evident congressional purpose of ensuring that no burden shall be imposed upon Indian traders for trading with Indians on reservations except as authorized by Acts of Congress or by valid regulations promulgated under those Acts.  This state tax on gross income would put financial burdens on appellant or the Indians with whom it deals in addition to those Congress or the tribes have prescribed, and could thereby disturb and disarrange the statutory plan Congress set up in order to protect Indians against prices deemed unfair or unreasonable by the Indian Commissioner.  And since federal legislation has left the State with no duties or responsibilities respecting the reservation Indians, we cannot believe that Congress intended to leave to the State the privilege of levying this tax. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Insofar as they are applied to this federally licensed Indian trader with respect to sales made to reservation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 380 U. S. 692</a></p><p> Indians on the reservation, these state laws imposing taxes cannot stand.  <em>Cf. Rice v.

Village of Espanola,</em> 68 N.M. 327, 334, 361 P.2d 950, 955-956; 58 I.D. 562.  <em>Cf.</em> 4 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 109 (1964 ed.), excepting taxes on Indians from the scope of the Act.  We think that interpretation was correct.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 1625, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2, 3.  Moreover, we hold that Indian traders trading on a reservation with reservation Indians are immune from a state tax like Arizona\'s not simply because those activities take place on a reservation, but, rather, because Congress, in the exercise of its power granted in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, has undertaken to regulate reservation trading in such a comprehensive way that there is no room for the States to legislate on the subject.  <em>Cf. Surplus Trading Co. v.

Even assuming that the Arizona tax here is of a kind to which the Buck Act applies, nothing whatever in that Act suggests to us that Congress meant to give States new power to tax federally licensed Indian traders.  <em>See</em> 58 I.D. 562.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
