JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents questions concerning the use of corporal punishment in public schools:  first, whether the paddling of students as a means of maintaining school discipline constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; and, second, to the extent that paddling is constitutionally permissible, whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners James Ingraham and Roosevelt Andrews filed the complaint in this case on January 7, 1971, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  At the time, both were enrolled in the Charles R. Drew Junior High School in Dade County, Fla., Ingraham in the eighth grade and Andrews in the ninth.  The complaint contained three counts, each alleging a separate cause of action for deprivation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1981-1988.  Counts one and two were individual actions for damages by Ingraham and Andrews based on paddling incidents that allegedly occurred in October, 1970, at Drew Junior High School.  Count three was a class action for declaratory and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 430 U. S. 654</a></p><p> injunctive relief filed on behalf of all students in the Dade County schools. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Named as defendants in all counts were respondents Willie J. Wright (principal at Drew Junior High School), Lemmie Deliford (an assistant principal), Solomon Barnes (an assistant to the principal), and Edward L. Whigham (superintendent of the Dade County School System). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners presented their evidence at a week-long trial before the District Court.  At the close of petitioners\' case, respondents moved for dismissal of count three "on the ground that, upon the facts and the law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief," Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 41(b), and for a ruling that the evidence would be insufficient to go to a jury on counts one and two. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court granted the motion as to all three counts, and dismissed the complaint without hearing evidence on behalf of the school authorities.   App. 142-150. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 430 U. S. 655</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners\' evidence may be summarized briefly.  In the 1970-1971 school year, many of the 237 schools in Dade County used corporal punishment as a means of maintaining discipline pursuant to Florida legislation and a local School Board regulation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The statute then in effect authorized limited corporal punishment by negative inference, proscribing punishment which was "degrading or unduly severe" or which was inflicted without prior consultation with the principal or the teacher in charge of the school.  Fla.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 232.27 (1961). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The regulation, Dade County School Board Policy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="656">Page 430 U. S. 656</a></p><p> 5144, contained explicit, directions and limitations. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The authorized punishment consisted of paddling the recalcitrant student on the buttocks with a flat wooden paddle measuring less than two feet long, three to four inches wide, and about one-half inch thick.  The normal punishment was limited to one to five "licks" or blows with the paddle, and resulted in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="657">Page 430 U. S. 657</a></p><p> no apparent physical injury to the student.  School authorities viewed corporal punishment as a less drastic means of discipline than suspension or expulsion.  Contrary to the procedural requirements of the statute and regulation, teachers often paddled students on their own authority without first consulting the principal. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners focused on Drew Junior High School, the school in which both Ingraham and Andrews were enrolled in the fall of 1970.  In an apparent reference to Drew, the District Court found that</p>\n<p>"[t]he instances of punishment which could be characterized as severe, accepting the students\' testimony as credible, took place in one junior high school."</p>\n<p>App. 147.  The evidence, consisting mainly of the testimony of 16 students, suggests that the regime at Drew was exceptionally harsh.  The testimony of Ingraham and Andrews, in support of their individual claims for damages, is illustrative.  Because he was slow to respond to his teacher\'s instructions, Ingraham was subjected to more than 20 licks with a paddle while being held over a table in the principal\'s office.  The paddling was so severe that he suffered a hematoma [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] requiring medical attention and keeping him out of school for several days. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Andrews was paddled several times for minor infractions.  On two occasions, he was struck on his arms, once depriving him of the full use of his arm for a week. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 430 U. S. 658</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court made no findings on the credibility of the students\' testimony.  Rather, assuming their testimony to be credible, the court found no constitutional basis for relief.  With respect to count three, the class action, the court concluded that the punishment authorized and practiced generally in the county schools violated no constitutional right.  <em>Id.</em> at 143, 149.  With respect to counts one and two, the individual damages actions, the court concluded that, while corporal punishment could in some cases violate the Eighth Amendment, in this case, a jury could not lawfully find</p>\n<p>"the elements of severity, arbitrary infliction, unacceptability in terms of contemporary standards, or gross disproportion which are necessary to bring \'punishment\' to the constitutional level of \'cruel and unusual punishment.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 143.</p>\n<p>A panel of the Court of Appeals voted to reverse.  498 F.2d 248 (CA5 1974).  The panel concluded that the punishment was so severe and oppressive as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the procedures outlined in Policy 5144 failed to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause.  Upon rehearing, the en banc court rejected these conclusions and affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  525 F.2d 909 (1976).  The full court held that the Due Process Clause did not require notice or an opportunity to be heard:</p>\n<p>"In essence, we refuse to set forth, as constitutionally mandated, procedural standards for an activity which is not substantial enough, on a constitutional level, to justify the time and effort which would have to be expended by the school in adhering to those procedures or to justify further interference by federal courts into the internal affairs of public schools."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 919.  The court also rejected the petitioners\' substantive contentions.  The Eighth Amendment, in the court\'s view, was simply inapplicable to corporal punishment in public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 430 U. S. 659</a></p><p> schools.  Stressing the likelihood of civil and criminal liability in state law, if petitioners\' evidence were believed, the court held that</p>\n<p>"[t]he administration of corporal punishment in public schools, whether or not excessively administered, does not come within the scope of Eighth Amendment protection."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 915.  Nor was there any substantive violation of the Due Process Clause.  The court noted that</p>\n<p>"[p]addling of recalcitrant children has long been an accepted method of promoting good behavior and instilling notions of responsibility and decorum into the mischievous heads of school children."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 917.  The court refused to examine instances of punishment individually:</p>\n<p>"We think it a misuse of our judicial power to determine, for example, whether a teacher has acted arbitrarily in paddling a particular child for certain behavior or whether, in a particular instance of misconduct, five licks would have been a more appropriate punishment than ten licks. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, limited to the questions of cruel and unusual punishment and procedural due process.  425 U.S. 990. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In addressing the scope of the Eighth Amendment\'s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, this Court has found it useful to refer to "[t]raditional common law concepts," <em>Powell v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/514/case.html">392 U. S. 514</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/514/case.html#535">392 U.

S. 531</a></span>.  So, too, in defining the requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 430 U. S. 660</a></p><p> of procedural due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court has been attuned to what "has always been the law of the land," <em>United States v. Barnett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/681/case.html">376 U. S. 681</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/681/case.html#692">376 U. S. 692</a></span> (1964), and to "traditional ideas of fair procedure."  <em>Greene v. McElroy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/474/case.html">360 U. S. 474</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/474/case.html#508">360 U. S. 508</a></span> (1959).  We therefore begin by examining the way in which our traditions and our laws have responded to the use of corporal punishment in public schools.</p>\n<p>The use of corporal punishment in this country as a means of disciplining schoolchildren dates back to the colonial period. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  It has survived the transformation of primary and secondary education from the colonials\' reliance on optional private arrangements to our present system of compulsory education and dependence on public schools. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Despite the general abandonment of corporal punishment as a means of punishing criminal offenders, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] the practice continues to play a role in the public education of schoolchildren in most parts of the country. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Professional and public opinion is sharply divided on the practice, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and has been for more than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="661">Page 430 U. S. 661</a></p><p> a century. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Yet we can discern no trend toward its elimination.</p>\n<p>At common law, a single principle has governed the use of corporal punishment since before the American Revolution:  teachers may impose reasonable but not excessive force to discipline a child. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Blackstone catalogued among the "absolute rights of individuals" the right "to security from the corporal insults of menaces, assaults, beating, and wounding," 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *134, but he did not regard it a "corporal insult" for a teacher to inflict "moderate correction" on a child in his care.  To the extent that force was "necessary to answer the purposes for which [the teacher] is employed," Blackstone viewed it as "justifiable or lawful."  <em>Id.</em> at *453; 3 <em>id.</em> at *120.  The basic doctrine has not changed. The prevalent rule in this country today privileges such force as a teacher or administrator "reasonably believes to be necessary for [the child\'s] proper control, training, or education."  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 147(2) (1965); <em>see id.</em> \xc2\xa7 153(2).  To the extent that the force is excessive or unreasonable, the educator in virtually all States is subject to possible civil and criminal liability. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 430 U. S. 662</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although the early cases viewed the authority of the teacher as deriving from the parents, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] the concept of parental delegation has been replaced by the view -- more consonant with compulsory education laws -- that the State itself may impose such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary "for the proper education of the child and for the maintenance of group discipline."  1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 3.20, p. 292 (1956). [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  All of the circumstances are to be taken into account in determining whether the punishment is reasonable in a particular case.  Among the most important considerations are the seriousness of the offense, the attitude and past behavior of the child, the nature and severity of the punishment, the age and strength of the child, and the availability of less severe but equally effective means of discipline.  <em>Id.</em> at 290-291; Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 150, Comments <em>c</em>-<em>e</em>, p. 268 (1965).</p>\n<p>Of the 23 States that have addressed the problem through legislation, 21 have authorized the moderate use of corporal punishment in public schools. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Of these States, only a few </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 430 U. S. 663</a></p><p> have elaborated an the common law test of reasonableness, typically providing for approval or notification of the child\'s parents, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] or for infliction of punishment only by the principal [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] or in the presence of an adult witness.

Bail, fines, and punishment traditionally have been associated with the criminal process, and, by subjecting the three to parallel limitations, the text of the Amendment suggests an intention to limit the power of those entrusted with the criminal law function of government.  An examination of the history of the Amendment and the decisions of this Court construing the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment confirms that it was designed to protect those convicted of crimes.  We adhere to this longstanding limitation, and hold that the Eighth Amendment does not apply to the paddling of children as a means of maintaining discipline in public schools.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The history of the Eighth Amendment is well known. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The text was taken, almost verbatim, from a provision of the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, which in turn derived from the English Bill of Rights of 1689.  The English version, adopted after the accession of William and Mary, was intended to curb the excesses of English judges under the reign of James II.  Historians have viewed the English provision as a reaction either to the "Bloody Assize," the treason trials conducted by Chief Justice Jeffreys in 1685 after the abortive rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] or to the perjury prosecution of Titus Oates in the same year. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 430 U. S. 665</a></p><p> either case, the exclusive concern of the English version was the conduct of judges in enforcing the criminal law.  The original draft introduced in the House of Commons provided: [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>"The requiring excessive bail of persons committed in criminal cases and imposing excessive fines, and illegal punishments, to be prevented."</p>\n<p>Although the reference to "criminal cases" was eliminated from the final draft, the preservation of a similar reference in the preamble [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] indicates that the deletion was without substantive significance.  Thus, Blackstone treated each of the provision\'s three prohibitions as bearing only on criminal proceedings and judgments. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>The Americans who adopted the language of this part of the English Bill of Rights in framing their own State and Federal Constitutions 100 years later feared the imposition of torture and other cruel punishments not only by judges acting beyond their lawful authority, but also by legislatures engaged in making the laws by which judicial authority would be measured.  <em>Weems v.

But if the American provision was intended to restrain government more broadly than its English model, the subject to which it was intended to apply -- the criminal process -- was the same.</p>\n<p>At the time of its ratification, the original Constitution was criticized in the Massachusetts and Virginia Conventions for its failure to provide any protection for persons convicted of crimes. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  This criticism provided the impetus for inclusion of the Eighth Amendment in the Bill of Rights.  When the Eighth Amendment was debated in the First Congress, it was met by the objection that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause might have the effect of outlawing what were then the common criminal punishments of hanging, whipping, and earcropping.  1 Annals of Cong. 754 (1789).  The objection was not heeded, "precisely because the legislature would otherwise have had the unfettered power to prescribe punishments for crimes."  <em>Furman v.

Though attendance may not always be voluntary, the public school remains an open institution.  Except perhaps when very young, the child is not physically restrained from leaving school during school hours; and at the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home.  Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends, and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment.</p>\n<p>The openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which the Eighth Amendment protects the prisoner.  In virtually every community where corporal punishment is permitted in the schools, these safeguards are reinforced by the legal constraints of the common law.  Public school teachers and administrators are privileged at common law to inflict only such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child; any punishment going beyond the privilege may result in both civil and criminal liability.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#659">430 U.

Under that longstanding accommodation of interests, there can be no deprivation of substantive rights as long as disciplinary corporal punishment is within the limits of the common law privilege.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the child\'s interest in procedural safeguards is insubstantial.  The school disciplinary process is not "a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and never unfair. . . ."  <em>Goss v.

In any deliberate infliction of corporal punishment on a child who is restrained for that purpose, there is some risk that the intrusion on the child\'s liberty will be unjustified, and therefore unlawful.

If the punishment inflicted is later found to have been excessive -- not reasonably believed at the time to be necessary for the child\'s discipline or training -- the school authorities inflicting it may be held liable in damages to the child and, if malice is shown, they may be subject to criminal penalties. [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p>Although students have testified in this case to specific instances of abuse, there is every reason to believe that such mistreatment is an aberration.  The uncontradicted evidence suggests that corporal punishment in the Dade County schools was, "[w]ith the exception of a few cases, . . . unremarkable in physical severity."  App. 147.  Moreover, because paddlings are usually inflicted in response to conduct directly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 430 U. S. 678</a></p><p> observed by teachers in their presence, the risk that a child will be paddled without cause is typically insignificant.  In the ordinary case, a disciplinary paddling neither threatens seriously to violate any substantive rights nor condemns the child "to suffer grievous loss of any kind."  <em>Anti-Fascist Comm. v.

Teachers and school authorities are unlikely to inflict corporal punishment unnecessarily or excessively when a possible consequence of doing so is the institution of civil or criminal proceedings against them. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>It still may be argued, of course, that the child\'s liberty interest would be better protected if the common law remedies were supplemented by the administrative safeguards of prior notice and a hearing.

[<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>There is a relevant analogy in the criminal law.  Although the Fourth Amendment specifically proscribes "seizure" of a person without probable cause, the risk that police will act unreasonably in arresting a suspect is not thought to require an advance determination of the facts.  In <em>United States v. Watson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/case.html">423 U.

Despite the distinct possibility that a police officer may improperly assess the facts and thus unconstitutionally deprive an individual of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="680">Page 430 U.

[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  There is no more reason to depart from tradition and require advance procedural safeguards for intrusions on personal security to which the Fourth Amendment does not apply.</p>\n<p><em>3\n</em></p>\n<p>But even if the need for advance procedural safeguards were clear, the question would remain whether the incremental benefit could justify the cost.  Acceptance of petitioners\' claims would work a transformation in the law governing corporal punishment in Florida and most other States.  Given the impracticability of formulating a rule of procedural due process that varies with the severity of the particular imposition, [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>] the prior hearing petitioners seek would have to precede any paddling, however moderate or trivial.</p>\n<p>Such a universal constitutional requirement would significantly burden the use of corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure.  Hearings -- even informal hearings -- require time, personnel, and a diversion of attention from normal school pursuits.  School authorities may well choose to abandon corporal punishment rather than incur the burdens of complying with the procedural requirements.  Teachers, properly concerned with maintaining authority in the classroom, may well prefer to rely on other disciplinary measures -- which they may view as less effective -- rather than confront the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 430 U. S. 681</a></p><p> possible disruption that prior notice and a hearing may entail. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  Paradoxically, such an alteration of disciplinary policy is most likely to occur in the ordinary case, where the contemplated punishment is well within the common law privilege. [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]</p>\n<p>Elimination or curtailment of corporal punishment would be welcomed by many as a societal advance.  But when such a policy choice may result from this Court\'s determination of an asserted right to due process, rather than from the normal processes of community debate and legislative action, the societal costs cannot be dismissed as insubstantial. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]  We are reviewing here a legislative judgment, rooted in history and reaffirmed in the laws of many States, that corporal punishment serves important educational interests.  This judgment must be viewed in light of the disciplinary problems commonplace in the schools.  As noted in <em>Goss v. Lopez,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#580">419 U.

[<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>"At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected . . . and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost."</p>\n<p><em>Mathews v.

In view of the low incidence of abuse, the openness of our schools, and the common law safeguards that already exist, the risk of error that may result in violation of a school child\'s substantive rights can only be regarded a minimal.  Imposing additional administrative safeguards as a constitutional requirement might reduce that risk marginally, but would also entail a significant intrusion into an area of primary educational responsibility.  We conclude that the Due Process Clause does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in the public schools, as that practice is authorized and limited by the common law.

The Eighth Amendment\'s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is inapplicable to school paddlings, and the Fourteenth Amendment\'s requirement of procedural due process is satisfied by Florida\'s preservation of common law constraints and remedies.

But the absence of reported Florida decisions hardly suggests that no remedy is available.  Rather, it merely confirms the common sense judgment that excessive corporal punishment is exceedingly rare in the public schools.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T46" name="F46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>The low incidence of abuse, and the availability of established judicial remedies in the event of abuse, distinguish this case from <em>Goss v.

Although Ohio law provided generally for administrative review, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2506.01 (Supp. 1973), the Court assumed that the short suspensions would not be stayed pending review, with the result that the review proceeding could serve neither a deterrent nor a remedial function.  419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#581">419 U.

It also holds </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 430 U. S. 684</a></p><p> that students in the public school systems are not constitutionally entitled to a hearing of any sort before beatings can be inflicted on them.  Because I believe that these holdings are inconsistent with the prior decisions of this Court and are contrary to a reasoned analysis of the constitutional provisions involved, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Eighth Amendment places a flat prohibition against the infliction of "cruel and unusual punishments."  This reflects a societal judgment that there are some punishments that are so barbaric and inhumane that we will not permit them to be imposed on anyone, no matter how opprobrious the offense.  <em>See Robinson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/case.html">370 U. S. 660</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/case.html#676">370 U. S. 676</a></span> (1962) (Douglas, J., concurring).  If there are some punishments that are so barbaric that they may not be imposed for the commission of crimes, designated by our social system as the most thoroughly reprehensible acts an individual can commit, then, <em>a fortiori,</em> similar punishments may not be imposed on persons for less culpable acts, such as breaches of school discipline.  Thus, if it is constitutionally impermissible to cut off someone\'s ear for the commission of murder, it must be unconstitutional to cut off a child\'s ear for being late to class. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Although there were no ears cut off in this case, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="685">Page 430 U. S. 685</a></p><p> record reveals beatings so severe that, if they were inflicted on a hardened criminal for the commission of a serious crime, they might not pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the majority holds that the Eighth Amendment "was designed to protect [only] those convicted of crimes," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#664">430 U. S. 664</a></span>, relying on a vague and inconclusive recitation of the history of the Amendment.  Yet the constitutional prohibition is against cruel and unusual punishments; nowhere is that prohibition limited or modified by the language of the Constitution.  Certainly, the fact that the Framers did not choose to insert the word "criminal" into the language of the Eighth Amendment is strong evidence that the Amendment was designed to prohibit all inhumane or barbaric punishments, no matter what the nature of the offense for which the punishment is imposed.</p>\n<p>No one can deny that spanking of school children is "punishment" under any reasonable reading of the word, for the similarities between spanking in public schools and other forms of punishment are too obvious to ignore.  Like other forms of punishment, spanking of school children involves an institutionalized response to the violation of some official rule or regulation proscribing certain conduct and is imposed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 430 U. S. 686</a></p><p> for the purpose of rehabilitating the offender, deterring the offender and others like him from committing the violation in the future, and inflicting some measure of social retribution for the harm that has been done.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>We are fortunate that, in our society, punishments that are severe enough to raise a doubt as to their constitutional validity are ordinarily not imposed without first affording the accused the full panoply of procedural safeguards provided by the criminal process. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The effect has been that</p>\n<p>"every decision of this Court considering whether a punishment is \'cruel and unusual\' within the meaning of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments has dealt with a criminal punishment."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#666">430 U. S. 666</a></span>.  The Court would have us believe from this fact that there is a recognized distinction between criminal and noncriminal punishment for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.  This is plainly wrong.  "[E]ven a clear legislative classification of a statute as <em>non-penal\' would not alter the fundamental nature of a plainly penal statute."  <em>Trop v. Dulles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/86/case.html">356 U. S. 86</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/86/case.html#95">356 U. S. 95</a></span> (1958) (plurality opinion).  The relevant inquiry is not whether the offense for which a punishment is inflicted has been labeled as criminal, but whether the purpose of the deprivation is among those ordinarily associated </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 430 U. S. 687</a></em></p><p><em> with punishment, such as retribution, rehabilitation, or deterrence.

Mendoza-Martinez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/144/case.html">372 U. S. 144</a></span> (1963)\n</em></p>\n<p>If this purposive approach were followed in the present case, it would be clear that spanking in the Florida public schools is punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.  The District Court found that</p>\n<p>"[c]orporal punishment is one of a variety of measures employed in the school system for the correction of pupil behavior and the preservation of order."</p>\n<p>App 146.  Behavior correction and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 430 U. S. 688</a></p><p> preservation of order are purposes ordinarily associated with punishment.</p>\n<p>Without even mentioning the purposive analysis applied in the prior decisions of this Court, the majority adopts a rule that turns on the label given to the offense for which the punishment is inflicted.  Thus, the record in this case reveals that one student at Drew Junior High School received 50 licks with a paddle for allegedly making an obscene telephone call.  Brief for Petitioners 13.  The majority holds that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit such punishment, since it was only inflicted for a breach of school discipline.  However, that same conduct is punishable as a misdemeanor under Florida law, Fla.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 365.18 (Supp. 177), and there can be little doubt that, if that same "punishment" had been inflicted by an officer of the state courts for violation of \xc2\xa7 365.16, it would have had to satisfy the requirements of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>In fact, as the Court recognizes, the Eighth Amendment has never been confined to criminal punishments. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Nevertheless, the majority adheres to its view that any protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment must have something to do with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 430 U. S. 689</a></p><p> criminals, and it would therefore confine any exceptions to its general rule that only criminal punishments are covered by the Eighth Amendment to abuses inflicted on prisoners.  Thus, if a prisoner is beaten mercilessly for a breach of discipline, he is entitled to the protection of the Eighth Amendment, while a school child who commits the same breach of discipline and is similarly beaten is simply not covered.</p>\n<p>The purported explanation of this anomaly is the assertion that school children have no need for the Eighth Amendment.  We are told that schools are open institutions, subject to constant public scrutiny; that school children have adequate remedies under state law; [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and that prisoners suffer the social stigma of being labeled as criminals.  How any of these policy considerations got into the Constitution is difficult to discern, for the Court has never considered any of these factors in determining the scope of the Eighth Amendment. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 430 U. S. 690</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The essence of the majority\'s argument is that school children do not need Eighth Amendment protection, because corporal punishment is less subject to abuse in the public schools than it is in the prison system. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  However, it cannot be reasonably suggested that, just because cruel and unusual punishments may occur less frequently under public scrutiny, they will not occur at all.  The mere fact that a public flogging or a public execution would be available for all to see would not render the punishment constitutional if it were otherwise impermissible.  Similarly, the majority would not suggest that a prisoner who is placed in a minimum security prison and permitted to go home to his family on the weekends should be any less entitled to Eighth Amendment protections than his counterpart in a maximum security prison.  In short, if a punishment is so barbaric and inhumane that it goes beyond the tolerance of a civilized society, its openness to public scrutiny should have nothing to do with its constitutional validity.</p>\n<p>Nor is it an adequate answer that school children may have other state and constitutional remedies available to them.  Even assuming that the remedies available to public school students are adequate under Florida law, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] the availability of state remedies has never been determinative of the coverage or of the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment.  The reason is obvious.  The fact that a person may have a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 430 U. S. 691</a></p><p> state law cause of action against a public official who tortures him with a thumbscrew for the commission of an antisocial act has nothing to do with the fact that such official conduct is cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  Indeed, the majority\'s view was implicitly rejected this Term in <em>Estelle v. Gamble,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/97/case.html">429 U. S. 97</a></span> (1976), when the Court held that failure to provide for the medical needs of prisoners could constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though a medical malpractice remedy in tort was available to prisoners under state law.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/97/case.html#107">429 U. S. 107</a></span> n. 15.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>By holding that the Eighth Amendment protects only criminals, the majority adopts the view that one is entitled to the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment only if he is punished for acts that are sufficiently opprobrious for society to make them "criminal."  This is a curious holding in view of the fact that the more culpable the offender, the more likely it is that the punishment will not be disproportionate to the offense, and consequently, the less likely it is that the punishment will be cruel and unusual. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Conversely, a public school student who is spanked for a mere breach of discipline may sometimes have a strong argument that the punishment does not fit the offense, depending upon the severity of the beating, and therefore that it is cruel and unusual.  Yet the majority would afford the student no protection no matter how inhumane and barbaric the punishment inflicted on him might be.</p>\n<p>The issue presented in this phase of the case is limited to whether corporal punishment in public schools can ever be prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  I am therefore not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 430 U. S. 692</a></p><p> suggesting that spanking in the public schools is, in every instance, prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  My own view is that it is not.  I only take issue with the extreme view of the majority that corporal punishment in public schools, no matter how barbaric, inhumane, or severe, is never limited by the Eighth Amendment.  Where corporal punishment becomes so severe as to be unacceptable in a civilized society, I can see no reason that it should become any more acceptable just because it is inflicted on children in the public schools.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority concedes that corporal punishment in the public schools implicates an interest protected by the Due Process Clause -- the liberty interest of the student to be free from "bodily restraint and punishment" involving "appreciable physical pain" inflicted by persons acting under color of state law.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#674">430 U. S. 674</a></span>.  The question remaining, as the majority recognizes, is what process is due.</p>\n<p>The reason that the Constitution requires a State to provide "due process of law" when it punishes an individual for misconduct is to protect the individual from erroneous or mistaken punishment that the State would not have inflicted had it found the facts in a more reliable way.  <em>See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html">424 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#335">424 U. S. 335</a></span>, 344 (1976).  In <em>Goss v. Lopez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html">419 U. S. 565</a></span> (1975), the Court applied this principle to the school disciplinary process, holding that a student must be given an informal opportunity to be heard before he is finally suspended from public school.</p>\n<p>"<em>Disciplinarians, although proceeding in utmost good faith, frequently act on the reports and advice of others,</em> and the controlling facts and the nature of the conduct under challenge are often disputed.  <em>The risk of error is not at all trivial,</em> and it should be guarded against if that may be done without prohibitive cost or interference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="693">Page 430 U. S. 693</a></p><p> with the educational process."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#580">419 U. S. 580</a></span>.  (Emphasis added.)  To guard against this risk of punishing an innocent child, the Due Process Clause requires not an "elaborate hearing" before a neutral party, but simply "an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian" which gives the student "an opportunity to explain his version of the facts."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#580">419 U.

S. 584</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court now holds that these "rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#581">419 U. S. 581</a></span>, are not required if the student is punished with "appreciable physical pain," rather than with a suspension, even though both punishments deprive the student of a constitutionally protected interest.  Although the respondent school authorities provide absolutely no process to the student before the punishment is finally inflicted, the majority concludes that the student is nonetheless given due process because he can later sue the teacher and recover damages if the punishment was "excessive."</p>\n<p>This tort action is utterly inadequate to protect against erroneous infliction of punishment for two reasons. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  First, under Florida law, a student punished for an act he did not commit cannot recover damages from a teacher "proceeding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="694">Page 430 U. S. 694</a></p><p> in utmost good faith . . . on the reports and advice of others," <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#692">430 U. S. 692</a></span>; the student has no remedy at all for punishment imposed on the basis of mistaken facts, at least as long as the punishment was reasonable from the point of view of the disciplinarian, uninformed by any prior hearing. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The "traditional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 430 U. S. 695</a></p><p> common law remedies" on which the majority relies, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#672">430 U. S. 672</a></span>, thus do nothing to protect the student from the danger that concerned the Court in <em>Goss</em> -- the risk of reasonable, good faith mistake in the school disciplinary process.</p>\n<p>Second, and more important, even if the student could sue for good faith error in the infliction of punishment, the lawsuit occurs after the punishment has been finally imposed.  The infliction of physical pain is final and irreparable; it cannot be undone in a subsequent proceeding.  There is every reason to require, as the Court did in <em>Goss,</em> a few minutes of "informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 430 U. S. 696</a></p><p> as a "meaningful hedge" against the erroneous infliction of irreparable injury.  419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#583">419 U. S. 583</a></span>-584. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority\'s conclusion that a damages remedy for excessive corporal punishment affords adequate process rests on the novel theory that the State may punish an individual without giving him any opportunity to present his side of the story, as long as he can later recover damages from a state official if he is innocent.  The logic of this theory would permit a State that punished speeding with a one-day jail sentence to make a driver serve his sentence first without a trial and then sue to recover damages for wrongful imprisonment. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Similarly, the State could finally take away a prisoner\'s good-time credits for alleged disciplinary infractions and require him to bring a damages suit after he was eventually released.  There is no authority for this theory, nor does the majority purport to find any, [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] in the procedural due process </p><p><a class="page-number" name="697">Page 430 U. S. 697</a></p><p> decisions of this Court.  Those cases have</p>\n<p>"consistently held that <em>some kind of hearing is required at some time before a person is finally deprived</em> of his property interests . . . , [and that] a person\'s liberty is equally protected. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Wolff v.

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to support its novel theory by drawing an analogy to warrantless arrests on probable cause, which the Court has held reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  <em>United States v. Watson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/case.html">423 U. S. 411</a></span> (1976).  This analogy fails for two reasons.  First, the particular requirements of the Fourth Amendment, rooted in the "ancient common law rule[s]" regulating police practices, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/case.html#418">423 U. S. 418</a></span>, must be understood in the context of the criminal justice system for which that Amendment was explicitly tailored.  Thus, in <em>Gerstein v. Pugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/case.html">420 U. S. 103</a></span> (1975), the Court, speaking through MR. JUSTICE POWELL, rejected the argument that procedural protections required in <em>Goss</em> and other due process </p><p><a class="page-number" name="698">Page 430 U. S. 698</a></p><p> cases should be afforded to a criminal suspect arrested without a warrant.</p>\n<p>"The Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and its balance between individual and public interests always has been thought to define the \'process that is due\' for seizures of person or property in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial. . . .  Moreover, the Fourth Amendment probable cause determination is, in fact, only the first stage of an elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct.  <em>The relatively simple civil procedures (e.g., prior interview with school principal before suspension) presented in the [procedural due process] cases cited in the concurring opinion are inapposite and irrelevant in the wholly different context of the criminal justice system.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/case.html#125">420 U.

While a case dealing with warrantless arrests is perhaps not altogether "inapposite and irrelevant in the wholly different context" of the school disciplinary process, such a case is far weaker authority than procedural due process cases such as <em>Goss v. Lopez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html">419 U. S. 565</a></span> (1975), that deal with deprivations of liberty outside the criminal context.</p>\n<p>Second, contrary to the majority\'s suggestion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#680">430 U. S. 680</a></span> n. 48, the reason that the Court has upheld warrantless arrests on probable cause is not because the police officer\'s assessment of the facts "may be subjected to subsequent judicial scrutiny in a civil action against the law enforcement officer or in a suppression hearing. . . ."  The reason that the Court has upheld arrests without warrants is that they are the "first stage of an elaborate system" of procedural protections, <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/case.html#125">420 U.

The Constitution requires the State to provide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="699">Page 430 U.

Bishop,</em> 404 F.2d 571 (CA8 1968), held that any paddling or flogging of prisoners, convicted of crime and serving prison terms, violated the cruel and unusual punishment ban of the Eighth Amendment.  But aside from the fact that <em>Bishop</em> has never been embraced by this Court, the theory of that case was not that bodily punishments are intrinsically barbaric or excessively severe, but that paddling of prisoners is "degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike."  <em>Id.</em> at 580.  That approach may be acceptable in the criminal justice system, but it has little if any relevance to corporal punishment in the schools, for it can hardly be said that the use of moderate paddlings in the discipline of children is inconsistent with the country\'s evolving standards of decency.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, when punishment involves a cruel, severe beating or chopping off an ear, something more than merely the dignity of the individual is involved.  Whenever a given criminal punishment is "cruel and unusual" because it is inhumane or barbaric, I can think of no reason why it would be any less inhumane or barbaric when inflicted on a school child, as punishment for classroom misconduct.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case is whether spankings inflicted on public school children for breaking school rules is "punishment," not whether such punishment is "cruel and unusual."  If the Eighth Amendment does not bar moderate spanking in public schools, it is because moderate spanking is not "cruel and unusual," not because it is not "punishment" as the majority suggests.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>By no means is it suggested that just because spanking of school children is "punishment" within the meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the school disciplinary process is in any way "criminal," and therefore subject to the full panoply of criminal procedural guarantees.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#692">430 U.

In <em>Trop,</em> the petitioner was convicted of desertion by a military court-martial and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge.  After he was punished for the offense he committed, petitioner\'s application for a passport was turned down.  Petitioner was told that he had been deprived of the "rights of citizenship" under \xc2\xa7 401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940 because he had been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces.  The plurality took the view that denationalization in this context was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The majority would have us believe that the determinative factor in <em>Trop</em> was that the petitioner had been convicted of desertion; yet there is no suggestion in <em>Trop</em> that the disposition of the military court-martial had anything to do with the decision in that case.  Instead, while recognizing that the Eighth Amendment extends only to punishments that are penal in nature, the plurality adopted a purposive approach for determining when punishment is penal.</p>\n<p>"In deciding whether or not a law is penal, this Court has generally based its determination upon the purpose of the statute.  If the statute imposes a disability for the purposes of punishment -- that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to deter others, etc. -- it has been considered penal.  But a statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose."</p>\n<p>356 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/356/86/case.html#96">356 U.

Such deliberate indifference to a prisoner\'s medical needs clearly is not punishment inflicted for the commission of a crime; it is merely misconduct by a prison official.  Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has held that whipping a prisoner with a strap in order to maintain discipline is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  <em>Jackson v. Bishop,</em> 404 F.2d 571 (1968) (Blackmun, J.).  <em>See also Knecht v.

If this were the case, the Court\'s present thesis would have little practical significance.  If, rather than holding that the Due Process Clause affords a remedy by way of the express commands of the Eighth Amendment, the majority would recognize a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for a deprivation of "liberty" flowing from an excessive paddling, the Court\'s opinion is merely a lengthy word of advice with respect to the drafting of civil complaints.</p>\n<p>Petitioners in this case did raise the substantive due process issue in their petition for certiorari, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#659">430 U.

If it is probable that school children would be entitled to protection under some theory of substantive due process, the Court should not now affirm the judgment below, but should amend the grant of certiorari and set this case for reargument.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In support of its policy considerations, the only cases from this Court cited by the majority are <em>Morrissey v.

Indeed, corporal punishment is seldom authorized in state prisons.  <em>See Jackson v. Bishop, supra</em> at 580, where MR.

Respondents concede that some of the petitioners who were punished "denied misconduct," and that, "in some cases, the punishments may have been mistaken. . . ."  Brief for Respondents 60-61.  The Court of Appeals panel below noted numerous instances of students punished despite claims of innocence, 498 F.2d 248, 256-258 (CA5 1974), and was "particularly disturbed by the testimony that whole classes of students were corporally punished for the misconduct of a few."  <em>Id.</em> at 268 n. 36.  To the extent that the majority focuses on the incidence of and remedies for unduly severe punishments, it fails to address petitioners\' claim that procedural safeguards are required to reduce the risk of punishments that are simply mistaken.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority\'s assurances to the contrary, it is unclear to me whether and to what extent Florida law provides a damages action against school officials for excessive corporal punishment.  Giving the majority the benefit of every doubt, I think it is fair to say that the most a student punished on the basis of mistaken allegations of misconduct can hope for in Florida is a recovery for unreasonable or bad faith error.  But I strongly suspect that even this remedy is not available.</p>\n<p>Although the majority does not cite a single case decided under Florida law that recognizes a student\'s right to sue a school official to recover damages for excessive punishment, I am willing to assume that such a tort action does exist in Florida.  I nevertheless have serious doubts about whether it would ever provide a recovery to a student simply because he was punished for an offense he did not commit.  All the cases in other jurisdictions cited by the majority, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#663">430 U. S. 663</a></span> n. 28, involved allegations of punishment disproportionate to the misconduct with which the student was charged; none of the decisions even suggest that a student could recover by showing that the teacher incorrectly imposed punishment for something the student had not done.  The majority appears to agree that the damages remedy is available only in cases of punishment unreasonable in light of the misconduct charged.  It states:</p>\n<p>"<em>In those cases where severe punishment is contemplated,</em> the available civil and criminal sanctions for abuse . . . afford significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#678">430 U. S. 678</a></span>. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Even if the common law remedy for excessive punishment extends to punishment that is "excessive" only in the sense that it is imposed on the basis of mistaken facts, the school authorities are still protected from personal liability by common law immunity.  (They are protected by statutory immunity for liability for enforcing disciplinary rules "[e]xcept in the case of excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment."  Fla.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 232.275 (1976).)  At a minimum, this immunity would protect school officials from damages liability for reasonable mistakes made in good faith.</p>\n<p>"Although there have been differing emphases and formulations of the common law immunity of public school officials in cases of student expulsion or suspension, state courts have generally recognized that such officers should be protected from tort liability under state law for all good faith, nonmalicious action taken to fulfill their official duties."</p>\n<p><em>Wood v. Strickland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/308/case.html">420 U.

S. 318</a></span> n. 9 (citing state cases).  Florida has applied this rule to a police officer\'s determination of probable cause to arrest; the officer is not liable in damages for an arrest not based on probable cause if the officer reasonably believed that probable cause existed.  <em>Miami v. Albro,</em> 120 So.2d 23, 26 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1960); <em>cf. Middleton v. Fort Walton Beach,</em> 113 So.2d 431 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1959) (police officer would be personally liable for intentional tort of making an arrest pursuant to warrant he knew to be void); <em>Wilson v. O\'Neal,</em> 118 So.2d 101 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1960) (law enforcement officer not liable in damages for obtaining an arrest warrant on the basis of an incorrect identification).  There is every reason to think that the Florida courts would apply a similar immunity standard in a hypothetical damages suit against a school disciplinarian.</p>\n<p>A final limitation on the student\'s damages remedy under Florida law is that the student can recover only from the personal assets of the official; the school board\'s treasury is absolutely protected by sovereign immunity from damages for the torts of its agents.  <em>Buck v. McLean,</em> 115 So.2d 764 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1959).  A teacher\'s limited resources may deter the jury from awarding, or prevent the student from collecting, the full amount of damages to which he is entitled.  <em>Cf. Bonner v.

The Court there held that, in levying on a taxpayer\'s assets pursuant to a jeopardy assessment, revenue agents must obtain a warrant before searching the taxpayer\'s office, but not before seizing his property in a manner that involves no invasion of privacy.  <em>G. M. Leasing</em> thus reflects the principle that the case for advance procedural safeguards (such as a magistrate\'s determination of probable cause) is more compelling when the Government finally inflicts an injury that cannot be repaired in a subsequent judicial proceeding (invasion of privacy) than when it inflicts a temporary injury which can be undone (seizure of property).  The infliction of bodily punishment, like the invasion of privacy, presents this most compelling case for advance procedural safeguards</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>To the extent that the majority attempts to find "a relevant analogy in the criminal law" -- warrantless arrests on probable cause -- to its holding here, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#679">430 U.

If the majority forthrightly applied its present due process analysis to the area of criminal prosecutions, the police officer not only could arrest a suspect without a warrant, but also could convict the suspect without a trial and sentence him to a short jail term.

Coughlin, supra,</em> dismissing an allegation by a prisoner that prison guards acting under color of state law had deprived him of property without due process of law by negligently failing to close the door of his cell after a search, with the foreseeable consequence that his trial transcript was stolen.  The panel held that the right to recover under state law for the negligence of state employees provided the prisoner with due process of law.  The decision is distinguishable from the instant case on two grounds.  First, recovery was not barred by sovereign or official immunity, and the state remedy ensured that the prisoner would be "made whole for any loss of property."  517 F.2d at 1319, and n. 23.  <em>Cf.

The point here, of course, is that the student cannot be made whole for the infliction of wrongful punishment.  Second, the State cannot hold a pre-deprivation hearing where it does not intend to inflict the deprivation; the best it can do to protect the individual from an unauthorized and inadvertent act is to provide a damages remedy.  517 F.2d at 1319 n. 25.

Generally, adequate notice and a fair opportunity to be heard in advance of any deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest are essential.  The Court has recognized, however, that the wording of the command that there shall be no deprivation "without" due process of law is consistent with the conclusion that a post-deprivation remedy is sometimes constitutionally sufficient. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>When only an invasion of a property interest is involved, there is a greater likelihood that a damages award will make a person completely whole than when an invasion of the individual\'s interest in freedom from bodily restraint and punishment has occurred.  In the property context, therefore, frequently a post-deprivation state remedy may be all the process that the Fourteenth Amendment requires.  It may also be true -- although I do not express an opinion on the point -- that an adequate state remedy for defamation may satisfy the due process requirement when a State has impaired an individual\'s interest in his reputation.  On that hypothesis, the Court\'s analysis today gives rise to the thought that <em>Paul v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/693/case.html">424 U.
