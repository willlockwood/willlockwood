The county court, upon the suggestion of those commissioners, submitted to the voters a proposition to subscribe for $250,000 of the stock, and, in obedience to their vote, ordered that the county court subscribe that amount, and that bonds to that amount, for sums and payable at times specified in the order, with the signatures of the presiding judge and the clerk of the county court and the seal of the county, should be sold or disposed of by a committee appointed for the purpose, and a list of them entered upon the records of the county.  The presiding judge and clerk issued such bonds for a greater amount, so signed and sealed, and with a certificate on the back of each, signed by the judge only, that it was issued as authorized by the statute and by an order of the county court in pursuance thereof.  All the bonds as they were delivered were entered upon the records of the county court, in a register open to public inspection.  <em>Held</em> that the county court had power to issue bonds to the amount of $250,000 only; that the bonds issued in excess of that amount were unlawful and void, even as against a purchaser before maturity, for value, and without notice of the over-issue; that the bonds to that amount, which were first delivered, were the valid ones, and that the county was not estopped to deny the validity of the others, either by the certificate endorsed thereon by the judge, or by payment of interest on all the bonds. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 117 U.

On March 22, 1870, were delivered bonds, payable in twenty years, to the amount of $92,500; the amount of like bonds previously delivered being $35,000, and the amount of all bonds previously delivered being $227,950.  Of the bonds delivered to the railroad company before February 17, 1870, there were afterwards returned by the company and cancelled and destroyed by the county bonds payable in five years to the amount of $100, and bonds payable in fifteen years to the amount of $3,000, leaving the excess issued $67,350.</p>\n<p>Among the records of the county court was a register, open to public inspection, in which were registered all the bonds as they were delivered.</p>\n<p>The coupons on all the bonds were paid by the county up to and including January 1, 1877.  The county also paid, before July 1, 1877, all or nearly all the bonds payable in five years, as well as five bonds of $100 each payable in 10 years.  The other bonds have not been paid.</p>\n<p>The court, against the defendant\'s objection, admitted testimony of the plaintiff that at various dates from February 1, 1870, to July 9, 1875, he purchased, before maturity and for value, the bonds and coupons sued on.  These consisted mostly of bonds payable in ten years, to the amount of $9,000, being some of those delivered to the railroad company on February 17, 1870, and the unpaid coupons annexed, and of coupons for $1,380, detached from some of the bonds payable in twenty years, which had been delivered to the railroad company on March 22, 1870.  Payment of the bonds and coupons held by the plaintiff was demanded by him on January 1, 1879, and refused by the county.</p>\n<p>Upon a bill filed May 12, 1875, by taxpayers of the county against the county court, the railroad company, and various bondholders by name (not including the present plaintiff), the circuit court of the county, on January 24, 1876, adjudged that the issue of bonds beyond $250,000 was unlawful and void, and that the county court be restrained by injunction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 117 U.

But the court overruled the motion, and at the plaintiff\'s request, instructed the jury that if they believed that the plaintiff purchased the bonds and coupons sued on before their maturity and for value and without notice that more than $250,000 of bonds had been issued by the defendant, the law was for the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff, before purchasing the bonds, was not bound to examine the records of the county court, and cannot be presumed to have known what the records contained when he made the purchase.

The defendant excepted to these rulings and instructions, and after verdict for the plaintiff, sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The county court had no power to subscribe for stock in the railroad corporation, or to issue bonds therefor, except as authorized by statute.  The statute authorized the county court to subscribe for such an amount of stock only as should be fixed and proposed by the commissioners named in the statute and be approved by the vote of a majority of the voters of the county, and the authority of the county court either to levy taxes or to issue bonds was limited to the amount so proposed and voted.  That amount was $250,000.  The county court therefore had no authority to issue bonds for a greater amount, and any bonds issued in excess of that amount were unlawful and void.  By the statute, the bonds were to be in such sums, and payable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="664">Page 117 U. S. 664</a></p><p> at such times, as the county court should determine.  The county court ordered that the bonds should be executed and made payable $50,000 in five years, $50,000 in ten years, $75,000 in fifteen years, and $75,000 in twenty years, and that the bonds should be signed by the judge and the clerk of the county court, and have the seal of the county impressed on each.  Notwithstanding this, bonds so signed and sealed were issued of each class to larger amount, amounting in all to $320,450, showing, after deducting bonds returned and cancelled, an excess of $67,350.  To the extent of this excess the bonds were invalid, and the county is liable upon bonds to the amount of $250,000 only.  It does not deny its liability to that amount.</p>\n<p>Then comes the question which of the bonds are valid and which invalid.  We can have no doubt that the test is which were first delivered if that can be ascertained, and without regard to the classification of bonds according to times of payment in the order of the county court, for, as the county court was authorized to determine at what time the bonds should be payable, anyone taking a bond signed by the presiding judge and the clerk, and bearing the seal of the county, had the right to presume that it was valid, provided the county court had not already issued bonds to the amount limited by the statute and by the vote.</p>\n<p>The certificate of the judge of the county court upon the back of each bond that it was issued as authorized by the statute, and by an order of the county court in pursuance thereof, cannot estop the county to deny that the particular bond is void because the county court, at the time of issuing it, had exhausted the power conferred by the act of the legislature and the vote of the people.  The certificate is not a recital in the bond.  It is not the act of the county court, is not under its seal, nor signed by its clerk, but is simply the certificate of the person holding the office of judge of that court.  Neither the statute nor the vote of the people nor the order of the county court empowered him to make such a certificate or to determine the question whether the county court had exceeded the power conferred upon it.  An officer\'s certificate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 117 U. S. 665</a></p><p> of a fact which he has no authority to determine is of no legal effect.  <em>Dixon County v. Field,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/83/case.html">111 U. S. 83</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Nor can the payment of interest on all the bonds have the effect of ratifying bonds issued beyond the lawful limit, for a ratification can have no greater force than a previous authority, and the county cannot ratify what it could not have authorized.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/676/case.html">Marsh v. Fulton County,</a></span></em> 10 Wall. 676.</p>\n<p>The necessary consequence is that the court below erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on all the bonds and coupons sued on if he purchased them before their maturity and for value and without notice that more than $250,000 of bonds had been issued by the defendant.  <em>Merchants\' Bank v. Bergen County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/384/case.html">115 U.

What part of his bonds and coupons the plaintiff may enforce against the county may depend upon further evidence of the exact dates of the delivery and the purchase of the several bonds that may be introduced upon another trial of this case, or perhaps in some other suit to which all the bondholders may be made parties, and therefore no opinion is expressed upon that question.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
