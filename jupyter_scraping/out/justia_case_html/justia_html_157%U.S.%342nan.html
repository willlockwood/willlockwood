The record of that court showed the following matters:</p>\n<p>The original action was brought in November, 1889, by "W. N.

Ellenwood," ordered "that the said action do stand revived in the name of said L. W. Ellenwood as such administrator, and proceed in his favor."</p>\n<p>The defendant filed an answer protesting against "the revivor of this action in the name of L. W. Ellenwood, as administrator of the estate of Latimer Bailey, deceased," and setting up that "said L. W. Ellenwood is not the successor in office of said W. N. Walton, as the administrator of the estate of said Latimer Bailey, deceased," and that Walton never was such administrator, and any appointment of him as such was void for want of jurisdiction in the court which appointed him.</p>\n<p>Upon the defendant\'s application, and after the introduction of evidence and a hearing, the court adjudged that the order reviving the action in Ellenwood\'s name be vacated and set aside, and that the action be abated and stricken from the docket.  To this judgment "the said L. W. Ellenwood duly excepted," and "the plaintiff, L. W. Ellenwood, as administrator of the estate of Latimer Bailey, deceased," tendered a bill of exceptions, which was allowed by the court on May 27, 1891.</p>\n<p>On June 19, 1891, a bond was filed in the clerk\'s office, executed by "L.

Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 32; 1 Stat. 91; Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 954.</p><p>At first it was treated by this Court as of course that a writ of error which contained no return day might be amended by inserting the day, and that the want of a date to the teste of a writ of error, as well as the omission to state the district in which the circuit court was held, might be made good by amendment, when there was enough in the record to amend by.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/4/12/case.html">Mossman v.

Pendleton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/339/case.html">115 U. S. 339</a></span>.  But the amendment rests in the discretion of the court, and will not be allowed if there is danger of prejudice to the adverse party or if there is any other good reason against it, as for instance that the main question presented by the record has been often decided by this Court.  <em>Pearson v. Yewdall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/95/294/case.html">95 U. S. 294</a></span>.</p><p>In the present case, the writ of error, describing, with gratuitous abbreviation, "W. N. Walton, adm\'r of the estate of Latimer Bailey, d\'c\'d," as the plaintiff in error, was manifestly intended to be sued out by and in behalf of the administrator of Latimer Bailey\'s estate.  The record sent up with the writ of error shows that the whole controversy was whether Ellenwood was legally such administrator, in place of Walton, by whom the original action had been brought, and that the exceptions to the decision below were taken and tendered, and the bond to prosecute the writ of error was given, by Ellenwood.  The case is clearly one in which "the statement of the title of the action or parties thereto in the writ is defective," and in which "the defect can be remedied by reference to the accompanying record," and the amendment asked for cannot prejudice the adverse party, and the merits of the case have not been discussed by counsel.  The amendment should therefore be allowed.</p><p>The description of Ellenwood, like that of Walton, both in the record and in the proposed amendment, gives him no Christian name beyond initial letters.  It is true, as argued by his counsel, that he might have had no Christian name.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/413/case.html">Breedlove v. Nicolet,</a></span></em> 7 Pet. 413,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/413/case.html#431">32 U. S. 431</a></span>.  But the affidavit filed in opposition to the motion to amend shows that he had one, </p><p><a class="page-number">Page 157 U. S. 348</a></p><p> and that his real name was Lowell W. Ellenwood.  The description of him by initials is therefore but an illustration of a loose and careless practice, which this Court does not countenance.  <em>Monroe Cattle Co. v. Becker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/47/case.html">147 U. S. 47</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/47/case.html#58">147 U. S. 58</a></span>.</p><p>The result is that the writ of error is to be amended by inserting the name of Lowell W. Ellenwood in the place of the name of W. N. Walton wherever that name appears in the writ of error.</p><p><em>Amendment allowed.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
