S. 857</a></p><p></p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to decide whether a felon possessing a firearm may be convicted and concurrently sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 922(h)(1) for receiving that firearm, and under 18 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 1202(a)(1) for possessing the same weapon.  469 U.S. 816 (1984).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>After driving around Honaker, Virginia, with several acquaintances, including petitioner Truman Ball, Hubert Romans discovered that his .32-caliber nickel-plated Rossi revolver was missing from the back seat of his car. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He reported the incident to the Russell County Sheriff\'s Department.  Subsequently, a neighbor notified the Sheriff that Ball had threatened him with a pistol matching the description of Romans\' revolver.  Later that same day, the police located Ball at another neighbor\'s home where Ball had tried unsuccessfully to sell the revolver.  When the police told Ball he was under arrest, Ball fled hut was promptly apprehended with Romans\' revolver in his possession.</p>\n<p>Ball, a previously convicted felon, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] was indicted on charges of receiving a firearm shipped in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h)(1) and 924(a), and possessing that firearm, 18 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 1202(a)(1). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  It is conceded that both counts rest on the same conduct.  Ball was convicted on both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="858">Page 470 U. S. 858</a></p><p> counts [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] by a jury in the Western District of Virginia and sentenced to consecutive terms of three years\' imprisonment on the receipt count and two years\' imprisonment on the possession count, the latter sentence suspended with two years\' probation.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Ball challenged the validity of the consecutive sentences.  The Government conceded that, under <em>United States v. Burton,</em> 629 F.2d 975 (CA4 1980), <em>cert. denied,</em> 450 U.S. 968 (1981), consecutive sentences could not be imposed for unlawful receipt and unlawful possession of the same firearm when the unlawful possession was incident to its unlawful receipt.  The Court of Appeals accepted this concession and adhered to its statement in <em>Burton</em> that "Congress in these firearms statutes created separate offenses, but did not authorize pyramiding penalties."  734 F.2d 965, 966 (CA4 1984) (citing <em>Burton, supra,</em> at 977).  The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to modify the sentences to make them concurrent.</p>\n<p>The application of the firearms statutes, \xc2\xa7 922(h)(1) and \xc2\xa7 1202(a)(1), charging a convicted felon with receiving and possessing the same gun, has produced conflicting decisions among the Courts of Appeals. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  We reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="859">Page 470 U. S. 859</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case requires the Court once again to resolve the "partial redundancy" of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a), provisions of Titles IV and VII, respectively, of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  <em>E.g., United States v. Batchelder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/case.html">442 U. S. 114</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/case.html#118">442 U. S. 118</a></span> (1979); <em>United States v. Bass,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html">404 U. S. 336</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html#341">404 U. S. 341</a></span>-343, and n. 9 (1971).  In these two Titles of the Omnibus Act, Congress sought to control the interstate traffic and availability of firearms.  Although Congress\' purposes are obvious, courts understandably have had difficulty applying the overlapping provisions of the Act.  This case affords an opportunity to address the application of Titles IV and VII to one set of circumstances -- where a single act is relied upon to establish a convicted felon\'s unlawful receipt and his unlawful possession of the same firearm. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>It is clear that a convicted felon may be prosecuted simultaneously for violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a) involving the same firearm.  This Court has long acknowledged the Government\'s broad discretion to conduct criminal prosecutions, including its power to select the charges to be brought in a particular case.  <em>E.g., United States v. Goodwin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/368/case.html">457 U. S. 368</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/368/case.html#382">457 U. S. 382</a></span> (1982); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/75/448/case.html#454">Confiscation Cases,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 454,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/454/case.html#457">74 U. S. 457</a></span>-459 (1869). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="860">Page 470 U. S. 860</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Batchelder,</em> this Court recognized that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a) proscribed similar conduct where the defendant is a convicted felon, but concluded that</p>\n<p>"each substantive statute, in conjunction with its own sentencing provision, operates independently of the other."</p>\n<p>442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/case.html#118">442 U. S. 118</a></span>.  This Court rejected the argument that \xc2\xa7 1202(a) impliedly repealed \xc2\xa7 922(h) with respect to acts covered by both provisions, noting that both the statutory language and the legislative history showed that the two provisions were to be applied independently.  <em>See id.</em> at 118-121. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Under these circumstances, there is no bar to the Government\'s proceeding with prosecution simultaneously under the two statutes. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="861">Page 470 U. S. 861</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>To say that a convicted felon may be prosecuted simultaneously for violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a), however, is not to say that he may be convicted and punished for two offenses.  Congress can be read as allowing charges under two different statutes with conviction and sentence confined to one.  Indeed, "[a]ll guides to legislative intent," <em>United States v. Woodward,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/105/case.html">469 U. S. 105</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/105/case.html#109">469 U. S. 109</a></span> (1985), show that Congress intended a felon in Ball\'s position to be convicted and punished for only one of the two offenses if the possession of the firearm is incidental to receiving it.</p>\n<p>This Court has consistently relied on the test of statutory construction stated in <em>Blockburger v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/299/case.html">284 U. S. 299</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/299/case.html#304">284 U. S. 304</a></span> (1932), to determine whether Congress intended the same conduct to be punishable under two criminal provisions.  The appropriate inquiry under <em>Blockburger</em> is "whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not."  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Woodward, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/105/case.html#107">469 U. S. 107</a></span>; <em>Albernaz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html">450 U. S. 333</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html#337">450 U. S. 337</a></span> (1981); <em>Whalen v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/684/case.html">445 U. S. 684</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/684/case.html#691">445 U. S. 691</a></span>-692 (1980).  The assumption underlying the <em>Blockburger</em> rule is that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes.</p>\n<p>For purposes of applying the <em>Blockburger</em> test in this setting as a means of ascertaining congressional intent, "punishment" must be the equivalent of a criminal conviction, and not simply the imposition of sentence.  Congress could not have intended to allow two convictions for the same conduct, even if sentenced under only one; Congress does not create criminal offenses having no sentencing component.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/11/32/case.html">United States v. Hudson &amp; Goodwin,</a></span></em> 7 Cranch 32,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/11/34/case.html">11 U. S. 34</a></span> (1812); <em>Tennessee v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html">100 U. S. 257</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html#275">100 U.

S. 862</a></p><p> <em>Cf.</em> Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 32(b)(1), which provides that the sentence is a necessary component of a "judgment of conviction."</p>\n<p>Applying this rule to the firearms statutes, it is clear that Congress did not intend to subject felons to two convictions; proof of illegal receipt of a firearm necessarily includes proof of illegal possession of that weapon.  "[W]hen received, a firearm is necessarily possessed."  <em>United States v. Martin,</em> 732 F.2d 591, 592 (CA7 1984). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In other words, Congress seems clearly to have recognized that a felon who receives a firearm must also possess it, and thus had no intention of subjecting that person to two convictions for the same criminal act.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a) supports this reading of congressional intent.  Titles IV and VII, enacted together as components of the Omnibus Act, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] disclose</p>\n<p>"Congress\' worry about the easy availability of firearms, especially to those persons who pose a threat to community peace."</p>\n<p><em>Lewis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html">445 U.

Accordingly, "[e]ach [Title] seeks to keep a firearm from <em>any person . . . who has been convicted\' of a felony. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html#64">445 U. S. 64</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 922(h), the receipt statute, is part of a "<em>carefully constructed package of gun control legislation,\' which had been in existence for many years."  <em>Batchelder,</em> 442 U.S. at </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="863">Page 470 U.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  One principal purpose of Title IV was to make\n</em></p>\n<p>"it possible to keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency. . . ."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 28 (1968).</p>\n<p>Section 1202(a), on the other hand, was a "last-minute Senate amendment" to the Omnibus Act, "hastily passed, with little discussion, no hearings, and no report."  <em>United States v. Bass,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html#344">404 U. S. 344</a></span> (footnote omitted).  The circumstances surrounding consideration of Title VII and the haste in which it was enacted may well explain why it does not dovetail neatly with the prohibition that was, at the time of its passage, already contained in Title IV. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Title VII was enacted as supplementary legislation; Title VII filled the gaps in and expanded the coverage of Title IV. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In short, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="864">Page 470 U. S. 864</a></p><p> we are persuaded that Congress had no intention of creating duplicative punishment for one limited class of persons falling within the overlap between the two Titles -- convicted felons who receive firearms and who, by definition, possess them.  The independent but overlapping statutes simply are not "directed to separate evils" under the circumstances.  <em>Albernaz,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html#343">450 U. S. 343</a></span>. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Having concluded that Congress did not intend petitioner\'s conduct to be punishable under both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a), the only remedy consistent with the congressional intent is for the District Court, where the sentencing responsibility resides, to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the underlying convictions.  The remedy of ordering one of the sentences to be served concurrently with the other cannot be squared with Congress\' intention.  One of the convictions, as well as its concurrent sentence, is unauthorized punishment for a separate offense.  <em>See Missouri v. Hunter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/359/case.html">459 U. S. 359</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/359/case.html#368">459 U. S. 368</a></span> (1983).</p>\n<p>The second conviction, whose concomitant sentence is served concurrently, does not evaporate simply because of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="865">Page 470 U. S. 865</a></p><p> the concurrence of the sentence.  The separate <em>conviction,</em> apart from the concurrent sentence, has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not be ignored.  For example, the presence of two convictions on the record may delay the defendant\'s eligibility for parole or result in an increased sentence under a recidivist statute for a future offense.  Moreover, the second conviction may be used to impeach the defendant\'s credibility, and certainly carries the societal stigma accompanying any criminal conviction.  <em>See Benton v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/case.html">395 U. S. 784</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/case.html#790">395 U. S. 790</a></span>-791 (1969); <em>Sibron v.

S. 54</a></span>-56 (1968).  Thus, the second conviction, even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment.</p>\n<p>We emphasize that, while the Government may seek a multiple-count indictment against a felon for violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(h) and 1202(a) involving the same weapon where a single act establishes the receipt and possession, the accused may not suffer two convictions or sentences on that indictment.  If, upon the trial, the district judge is satisfied that there is sufficient proof to go to the jury on both counts, he should instruct the jury as to the elements of each offense.

S. 123</a></span>-124, interpreting the reference to "either" statute to require the Government to proceed under only one of the two provisions.  The Court\'s observation was a response to the claim that the two statutes permitted excessive prosecutorial discretion because the Government could, in effect, choose the penalty to apply in a given case by proceeding under one statute instead of the other.  The Court\'s reference to "either" statute merely reaffirmed the Government\'s discretion to charge under one statute rather than the other.  The Court had no intention of restricting the Government to prosecuting for only a single offense, an issue not before the Court.  This is confirmed by <em>Batchelder\'s</em> conclusion that the two statutes are "each fully enforceable on [their] own terms."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/114/case.html#119">442 U.

Section 922(h), although maintaining \xc2\xa7 2(f)\'s operative phrase, expanded the categories of persons prohibited from receiving firearms.  <em>See</em> Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Senator Tydings, for example, explained that "Title VII . . . is . . . primarily designed to restrict access to handguns to criminals, juveniles, and fugitives."  114 Cong.Rec. 13639 (1968).  <em>See also id.</em> at 13868, 14773 (remarks of Sen.

Section 922(h), for example, covers persons who are under indictment for a felony, who are fugitives, and who are narcotics offenders.  Section 1202(a), on the other hand, covers persons dishonorably discharged from the service, illegal aliens, and persons who have renounced their citizenship.  Senator Long explained that the assortment of persons brought within the ambit of \xc2\xa7 1202(a) reflected those responsible for the rash of assassinations and publicized murders in "recent history," which included the deaths of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as the murders of several civil rights workers in the South.  114 Cong.Rec. 14773 (1968).  Only two groups -- convicted felons and adjudicated mental incompetents -- fall within the overlap between the two provisions.  There is no suggestion in the legislative history that these persons pose a greater threat to society such that Congress thought they deserved to be punished more severely, <em>i.e.,</em> under both statutes for a single act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>This appears to be the import of the Government\'s concession in <em>Taylor v.

Before this Court, the Government acknowledged that,</p>\n<p>"since receipt of a firearm will almost necessarily entail possession of that firearm, . . . we agree with petitioner that it is unlikely that Congress intended to permit consecutive punishment in the circumstances presented here."</p>\n<p>Memorandum for United States in <em>Taylor v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court unnecessarily volunteers the opinion that "there is no bar to the Government\'s proceeding with prosecution simultaneously under the two statutes."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/856/case.html#860">470 U.

Even if that opinion were well founded, I see no reason why this Court should go out of its way to encourage prosecutors to tilt the scales of justice against the defendant by employing such tactics.</p>\n<p>The views that JUSTICE MARSHALL expressed in his dissent in <em>Missouri v. Hunter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/359/case.html">459 U.

S. 371</a></span>-372 (1983), succinctly explain why I concur in the Court\'s judgment today:</p>\n<p>"[T]he entry of two convictions and the imposition of two sentences cannot be justified on the ground that the legislature could have simply created one crime but prescribed harsher punishment for that crime.  This argument incorrectly assumes that the total sentence imposed is all that matters, and that the number of convictions that can be obtained is of no relevance to the concerns underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause."</p>\n<p>"When multiple charges are brought, the defendant is \'put in jeopardy\' as to each charge.  To retain his freedom, the defendant must obtain an acquittal on all charges; to put the defendant in prison, the prosecution need only obtain a single guilty verdict.  The prosecution\'s ability to bring multiple charges increases the risk that the defendant will be convicted on one or more of those charges.  The very fact that a defendant has been arrested, charged, and brought to trial on several charges may suggest to the jury that he must be guilty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="868">Page 470 U. S. 868</a></p><p> of at least one of those crimes.  Moreover, where the prosecution\'s evidence is weak, its ability to bring multiple charges may substantially enhance the possibility that, even though innocent, the defendant may be found guilty on one or more charges as a result of a compromise verdict.  The submission of two charges, rather than one, gives the prosecution"</p>\n<p>"the advantage of offering the jury a choice -- a situation which is apt to induce a doubtful jury to find the defendant guilty of the less serious offense, rather than to continue the debate as to his innocence."</p>\n<p>"<em>Cichos v.
