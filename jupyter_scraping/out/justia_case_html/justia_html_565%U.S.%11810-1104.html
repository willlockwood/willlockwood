Robbins, \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 537\n, fairly summarizes the basic considerations the Court applies here.  In deciding whether to recognize a Bivens remedy, a court must first ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhether any alternative, existing process for protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding\xe2\x80\x9d damages remedy.  Even absent an alternative, \xe2\x80\x9ca Bivens remedy is a subject of judgment: \xe2\x80\x98the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 550.  In Bivens itself, the Court held that the \n \nFourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents\xe2\x80\x99 violation of the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s strictures, 403 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389, noting that the \n \nFourth Amendment prohibited conduct that state law might permit, id., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393, and that the interests protected on the one hand by state \xe2\x80\x9ctrespass\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d laws and on the other hand by the \n \nFourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cmay be inconsistent or even hostile,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 394.  It also stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 395, and found \xe2\x80\x9cno special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 396.  Bivens actions were allowed in Davis v. Passman, \n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228\n, for a \n \nFifth Amendment due process claim involving gender-based employment discrimination, and in Carlson v. Green, \n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 14\n, for an \n \nEighth Amendment claim based on federal government officials\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberat[e] indifferen[ce]\xe2\x80\x9d to a federal prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s medical needs, id., at 16, n.\xc2\xa01, 17.  Since Carlson, this Court has declined to imply a Bivens action in several different instances.  See, e.g., Bush v. Lucas, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367\n, Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61\n. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying Wilkie\xe2\x80\x99s approach here, Pollard cannot assert a Bivens claim, primarily because his \n \nEighth Amendment claim focuses on a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law.  And in the case of a privately employed defendant, state tort law provides an \xe2\x80\x9calternative, existing process\xe2\x80\x9d capable of protecting the constitutional interests at stake.  Wilkie, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 550.  The existence of that alternative remedy constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cconvincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding\xe2\x80\x9d damages remedy.  Ibid.  Pp. 3\xe2\x88\x927.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s contrary arguments are rejected.  First, he claims that Carlson authorizes an \n \nEighth Amendment-based Bivens action here, but Carlson involved government, not privately employed, personnel.  The potential existence of an \xe2\x80\x9cadequate alternative, existing process\xe2\x80\x9d differs dramatically for public and private employees, as prisoners ordinarily can bring state tort actions against private employees, but not against public ones.  Second, Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this Court should consider only whether federal laws provide adequate alternative remedies because of the \xe2\x80\x9cvagaries\xe2\x80\x9d of state tort law, Carlson, supra, at 23, was rejected in Malesko, supra, at 72\xe2\x88\x9273.  Third, Pollard claims that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here, but California, like every other State (as far as the Court is aware), has tort law that provides for negligence actions for claims such as his.  That the state law may prove less generous than would a Bivens action does not render the state law inadequate, and state remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent. Fourth, Pollard argues that there may be similar \n \nEighth Amendment claims that state tort law does not cover, but he offers no supporting cases.  The possibility of a future case, where an \n \nEighth Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from those at issue, provides insufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.

We consequently apply its approach here.  And we conclude that Pollard cannot assert a Bivens claim.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is primarily because Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nEighth Amendment claim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law.

The existence of that alternative here constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cconvincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in dam- ages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Our reasoning is best understood if we set forth and explain why we reject Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPollard (together with supporting amici) asks us to imply a Bivens action for four basic reasons\xe2\x80\x94none of which we find convincing.  First, Pollard argues that this Court has already decided in Carlson that a federal prisoner may bring an \n \nEighth Amendment-based Bivens action against prison personnel; and we need do no more than simply apply Carlson\xe2\x80\x99s holding here.  Carlson, however, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought damages from personnel employed by the government, not personnel employed by a private firm.  446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25.  And for present purposes that fact\xe2\x80\x94of employment status\xe2\x80\x94makes a critical difference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, the potential existence of an adequate \xe2\x80\x9calternative, existing process\xe2\x80\x9d differs dramatically in the two sets of cases.  Prisoners ordinarily cannot bring state-law tort actions against employees of the Federal Government.  See 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act) (substituting United States as defendant in tort action against federal employee); Osborn v. Haley, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 225, \n238, \n241 (2007)\n (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee through removal and substitution of United States as defendant).  But prisoners ordinarily can bring state-law tort actions against employees of a private firm.  Infra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting opinion in Malesko, namely that a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s suit against a private prison-management firm should fall within Carlson\xe2\x80\x99s earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal employee, is a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal agent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare Malesko, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70, and n. 4 (majority opinion), with id., at 76\xe2\x80\x9377, 82 (dissenting opinion).  In rejecting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the Court explained that the context in Malesko was \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally different\xe2\x80\x9d from the contexts at issue in earlier cases, including Carlson.  534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70.  That difference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of the defendant, i.e., a corporate employer rather than an individual employee, ibid., and in part reflected the existence of alternative \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d state tort remedies, id., at 72\xe2\x80\x9373.  This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to square Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s argument with Malesko\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Pollard argues that, because of the \xe2\x80\x9cvagaries\xe2\x80\x9d of state tort law, Carlson, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 23, we should consider only whether federal law provides adequate alternative remedies.  See id., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 23 (considering adequacy of federal remedies); see also, e.g., Schweiker, supra, at 423 (similar); Bush, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 378 (similar).  But cf. Carlson, supra, at 24 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[R]elevant Indiana statute would not permit survival of the [state tort] claim\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  This argument flounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it in Malesko.  Compare 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (majority opinion), with id., at 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making similar suggestion).  State tort law, after all, can help to deter constitutional violations as well as to provide compensation to a violation\xe2\x80\x99s victim.  And it is consequently unsurprising that several cases have considered the adequacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determining whether to imply a Bivens remedy.  See, e.g., Bivens, 403 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 394 (state tort law \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent or even hostile\xe2\x80\x9d to \n \nFourth Amendment); Davis, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 245, n. 23 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. Malesko, supra, at 70 (noting that the Court has implied Bivens action only where any alternative remedy against individual officers was \xe2\x80\x9cnonexistent\xe2\x80\x9d or where plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9clacked any alternative remedy\xe2\x80\x9d at all).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, Pollard argues that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here.  Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s claim, however, is a claim for physical or related emotional harm suffered as a result of aggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state tort law typically forbids.  That claim arose in California, where state tort law provides for ordinary negligence actions, for actions based upon \xe2\x80\x9cwant of ordinary care or skill,\xe2\x80\x9d for actions for \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent failure to diagnose or treat,\xe2\x80\x9d and for actions based upon the failure of one with a custodial duty to care for another to protect that other from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unreasonable risk of physical harm.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71714(a), 1714.8(a) (West 2009 and Supp. 2012); Giraldo v. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 168 Cal. App. 4th 231, 248, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 371, 384 (2008) (quoting Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557, 562, 592 P. 2d 820, 824 (1979)).  California courts have specifically applied this law to jailers, including private operators of prisons.  Giraldo, supra, at 252, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 387 (\xe2\x80\x9c[J]ailers owe prisoners a duty of care to protect them from foreseeable harm\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Lawson v. Superior Ct., 180 Cal.

See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314A(4), 320 (1963\xe2\x80\x931964).  We have found specific authority indicating that state law imposes general tort duties of reasonable care (including medical care) on prison employees in every one of the eight States where privately managed secure federal facilities are currently lo- cated.

Civ. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73333.2(b) (West 1997), or by forbidding recovery for emotional suffering unconnected with physical harm, see 629 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 864, or by imposing procedural obstacles, say, initially requiring the use of expert administrative panels in medical malpractice cases, see, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa72853, (Supp. 2010); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 231, \xc2\xa760B (West 2010).  But we cannot find in this fact sufficient basis to determine state law inadequate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tState-law remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent.  See Bush, supra, at 388 (administrative remedies adequate even though they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not provide complete relief\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, federal law as well as state law contains limitations.  Prisoners bringing federal lawsuits, for example, ordinarily may not seek damages for mental or emotional injury unconnected with physical injury. See \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(e).  And Bivens actions, even if more generous to plaintiffs in some respects, may be less generous in others.  For example, to show an \n \nEighth Amendment violation a prisoner must typically show that a defendant acted, not just negligently, but with \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Farmer v. Brennan, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 825, \n834 (1994)\n.  And a Bivens plaintiff, unlike a state tort law plaintiff, normally could not apply principles of respondeat superior and thereby obtain recovery from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s potentially deep-pocketed employer.  See Ash- croft v. Iqbal, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662, \n676 (2009)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRather, in principle, the question is whether, in general, state tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives for potential defendants to comply with the \n \nEighth Amendment while also providing roughly similar compensation to victims of violations.  The features of the two kinds of actions just mentioned suggest that, in practice, the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  And we have found nothing here to convince us to the contrary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, Pollard argues that there \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d be similar kinds of \n \nEighth Amendment claims that state tort law does not cover.  But Pollard does not convincingly show that there are such cases.  Compare Brief for Respondent Pollard 32 (questioning the availability of state tort remedies for \xe2\x80\x9cprisoners [who] suffer attacks by other inmates, preventable suicides, or the denial of heat, ventilation or movement\xe2\x80\x9d), with Giraldo, supra, at 248\xe2\x80\x93249, 85 Cal Rptr. 3d, at 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (courts have long held that prison officials must protect, e.g., transgender inmate from foreseeable harm by other inmates), and Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314A(4), 320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRegardless, we concede that we cannot prove a negative or be totally certain that the features of state tort law relevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we have described them.  Nonetheless, we are certain enough about the shape of present law as applied to the kind of case before us to leave different cases and different state laws to another day.  That is to say, we can decide whether to imply a Bivens action in a case where an \n \nEighth Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from those at issue here when and if such a case arises.  The possibility of such a different future case does not provide sufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, where, as here, a federal prisoner seeks damages from privately employed personnel working at a privately operated federal prison, where the conduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the \n \nEighth Amendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law (such as the conduct involving improper medical care at issue here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state tort law.

Even if the narrowest rationale of Bivens did apply here, however, I would decline to extend its holding.  Bivens is \xe2\x80\x9ca relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d by constitutional implication.  Correctional Services Corp. v.

See Carlson v. Green, \n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 14 (1980)\n (Bivens action); Estelle v. Gamble, \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 97 (1976)\n (\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 action).  For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion I joined in Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61\n\xe2\x80\x9383 (2001) (opinion of Stevens, J.), I would not deny the same character of relief to Pollard, a prisoner placed by federal contract in a privately operated prison.  Pollard may have suffered \xe2\x80\x9caggravated instances\xe2\x80\x9d of conduct state tort law forbids, ante, at 9 (opinion of the Court), but that same aggravated conduct, when it is engaged in by official actors,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t also offends the Federal Constitution, see Estelle, 429 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  Rather than remitting Pollard to the \xe2\x80\x9cvagaries\xe2\x80\x9d of state tort law, Carlson, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 23, I would hold his injuries, sustained while serving a feder-al sentence, \xe2\x80\x9ccompensable according to uniform rules of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, \n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388, \n409 (1971)\n (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, there is stronger cause for providing a federal remedy in this case than there was in Malesko.  There, the question presented was whether a Bivens action lies against a private corporation that manages a facility housing federal prisoners.  Malesko, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 63.  Suing a corporate employer, the majority observed in Malesko, would not serve to deter individual officers from conduct transgressing constitutional limitations on their authority.  Id., at 70\xe2\x80\x9371.  Individual deterrence, the Court reminded, was the consideration central to the Bivens decision.  Malesko, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70.  Noting the availability of state tort remedies, the majority in Malesko declined to \xe2\x80\x9cexten[d] Bivens beyond [that decision\xe2\x80\x99s] core premise,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., deterring individual officers.  Malesko, 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 71\xe2\x80\x9373.  Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s case, in contrast, involves Bivens\xe2\x80\x99 core concern:  His suit seeking damages directly from individual officers would have precisely the deterrent effect the Court found absent in Malesko.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, I would hold that relief potentially available under state tort law does not block Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s recourse to a federal remedy for the affront to the Constitution he suffered.  Accordingly, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit ruled that petitioners acted under color of federal law, Pollard v.
