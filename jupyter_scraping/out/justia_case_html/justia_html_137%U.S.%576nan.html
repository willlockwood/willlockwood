CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court..</p>\n<p>In this cause, trial by jury was waived by agreement of the parties in writing, duly filed, and the case was tried by the court.  But the record discloses no finding upon the facts, either general or special, in accordance with the statutes (Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 649, 700), and no questions are therefore open to our revision as an appellate tribunal.  As the circuit court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, its judgment must be presumed to be right, and on that ground</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
