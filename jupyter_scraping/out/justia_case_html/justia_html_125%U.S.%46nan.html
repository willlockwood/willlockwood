The plaintiff moved to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction and also moved to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the facts as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The defendant contended in the courts of New York that those courts had no jurisdiction because the plaintiff\'s right to maintain her action depended upon the question whether the second reissue of her patent was valid or invalid under the patent laws of the United States, and that of that question the courts of the United States had exclusive jurisdiction.  The judgments or each court of the state, holding that the question of the validity of that reissue could not be contested in this action, and assuming jurisdiction to render judgment against the defendant, necessarily involved a decision against the immunity claimed by the defendant under the Constitution and laws of the United States, which this Court has jurisdiction to review.</p>\n<p>The motion to dismiss must therefore be denied, but the decision was so clearly right that the motion to affirm is granted.</p>\n<p>The action was upon an agreement in writing by which the plaintiff, as owner of letters patent already once reissued, granted to the defendant an exclusive license to make and sell the patented articles within a certain territory during the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 125 U. S. 52</a></p><p> term of the patent and of any extension or renewal thereof, and the defendant expressly acknowledged the validity of the letters patent and stipulated that the plaintiff might, without prejudice to this agreement, obtain further reissues, and promised to pay to the plaintiff certain royalties so long as no decision adverse to the validity of the patent should have been rendered.</p>\n<p>The defendant contended that this was a case arising under the patent laws, of which the courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 629, cl. 9; \xef\xbf\xbd 711, cl. 5.  But it is clearly established by a series of decisions of this Court that an action upon such an agreement as that here sued on is not a case arising under the patent laws.  It has been decided that a bill in equity in the circuit court of the United States by the owner of letters patent to enforce a contract for the use of the patent right or to set aside such a contract because the defendant has not complied with its terms is not within the acts of Congress by which an appeal to this Court is allowable in cases arising under the patent laws, without regard to the value of the matter in controversy.

S. 613</a></span>, a patentee filed a bill in equity in a state court setting up a contract by which he agreed to assign his patent to the defendants, and they agreed to pay him certain royalties, and alleging that the defendants had refused to account for or pay such royalties to him, and had fraudulently excluded him from inspecting their books of account.  The defendants answered that the plaintiff had been paid all the royalties to which he was entitled, and that if he claimed more, it was because he insisted that goods made under another patent were an infringement of his.  This Court held that it was not a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, removable as such into the circuit court under the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, \xc2\xa7 2, 18 Stat. 470.  It was said by Chief Justice Taney in <em>Wilson v. Sandford,</em> and repeated by the Court in <em>Hartell v. Tilghman</em> and in <em>Albright v. Texas:</em></p>\n<p>"The dispute in this case does not arise under any act of Congress, nor does the decision depend upon the construction of any law in relation to patents.  It arises out of the contract stated in the bill, and there is no act of Congress providing for or regulating contracts of this kind.  The rights of the parties depend altogether upon common law and equity principles."</p>\n<p>10 How.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/51/99/case.html#101">51 U.

Whether that court was right in its suggestion that it would have no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the second reissue if incidentally drawn in question in an action upon an agreement between the parties we need not consider, inasmuch as it expressly declined to pass upon any such question because it held that, in this action to recover royalties due under the agreement, the defendant, while continuing to enjoy the privileges of the license, was estopped to deny the validity of the patent or of any reissue thereof.  The decision was based upon the contract between the parties, and the court did not decide, nor was it necessary for the determination of the case that it should decide, any question depending on the construction or effect of the patent laws of the United States.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/59/289/case.html">Kinsman v. Parkhurst,</a></span></em> 18 How. 289; <em>Brown v. Atwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/327/case.html">92 U. S. 327</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* Peckham, J.  We think this case is controlled by that of <em>Marston v. Swett,</em> reported upon two appeals to this court.  <em>See</em> 66 N.Y. 206; 82 N.Y. 526.</p>\n<p>The general and material features of the two cases are similar.  In both, there was an agreement on the part of the plaintiff to refrain from manufacturing in consideration, among other things, of the promise of the defendant to pay the royalties.  While continuing the manufacture under the license, the defendant ought not to escape liability to pay the royalties.  The defendant\'s counsel, it is true, seeks to distinguish this case from <em>Marston v. Swett, supra,</em> because, as he says, since the reissue of the patent in 1881, which he insists was wholly void, the defendant has no protection from the manufacture by others, for the reason that by the surrender of the patent of 1878 and the reissue of 1881, there was no valid patent in existence, and the consideration for the promise to pay royalties had therefore wholly failed.</p>\n<p>There was consideration enough for the promise to pay such royalties in that the plaintiff bound herself not to manufacture, and because the defendant could not be called to account as an alleged infringer while manufacturing under the license.</p>\n<p>If it were a question of the validity of the reissue of 1881, and a decision of that question were necessary to the decision of this case, the defendant is, of course, correct in his claim that a state court has no jurisdiction to determine such an issue; but within the decision of the <em>Marston</em> case, no such question arises.  The defendant has protection enough to base its promise to pay royalty upon, as long as it so conducts itself towards the plaintiff as to prevent her from treating it as an infringer.  In other words, so long as the defendant continues to manufacture under its license (the patent not having been legally annulled), and thus elects to treat the agreement as in existence, it prevents the plaintiff from treating the defendant in any other light than that of a licensee.  If the defendant desired to repudiate any obligation under this agreement, it should have given notice to the plaintiff that it refused to longer recognize its binding force, and that it would thereafter manufacture under a claim of right founded upon the alleged invalidity of the patent.  Otherwise, the defendant in claiming to manufacture under the license and refusing to pay the royalties thereunder would, if successful, prevent the plaintiff from recovering anything from it.  She could not treat the defendant as an infringer because it was manufacturing under a license from her, and she could not collect the royalties under the license (although herself refraining from manufacturing, as she had agreed), because the defendant would allege the invalidity of the patent, although continuing to manufacture under cover of a license from its owner.  Such doctrine cannot stand a moment.  Of course, as is said in the <em>Marston</em> case, from the time that the patent is mulled by proper legal proceedings, no royalties could be collected, even though no notice of a repudiation of the agreement had been thereafter served.</p>\n<p>There is another ground upon which it seems to me this judgment might well rest.  Under the clause in the agreement between the parties which provided for a forfeiture of all rights thereunder if one party should willfully violate one of its provisions, the plaintiff gave notice of such forfeiture to the defendant based upon its refusal to pay the royalties which it had acknowledged to be due for the quarter ending October 31, 1581 (the very quarter in question here), an account of which it had rendered under the oath of its secretary, as provided for in such agreement.  Subsequently to the service of such notice, the plaintiff withdrew the same at the request of the defendant and upon its promise to pay these very royalties which it had already acknowledged to be due.  A failure to carry out such promise gives, as it seems to me, a good cause of action.</p>\n<p>The defendant says there was no consideration for such a promise, because there was no patent upon which to ground a license and the defendant therefore had no license and no protection; but the plaintiff, of course, contended that the reissued patent was valid, and at the request of the defendant the plaintiff withdrew her notice of forfeiture of the license, and thus reinstated the defendant in its possession, and freed it from the liability to be proceeded against as an infringer and put to expense and inconvenience in the defense of such a litigation.  This was saved at the request of the defendant and upon its special promise to pay the royalties.  Plainly here was a good and sufficient consideration for the defendant\'s promise.</p>\n<p>The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.  All concur.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
