CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93340.Argued March 28, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 20, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioners, hoteliers in respondent city, initiated this litigation over the application of an ordinance requiring them to pay a $567,000 fee for converting residential rooms to tourist rooms.  They initially sought mandamus in California state court, but that action was stayed when they filed suit in Federal District Court asserting, <em>inter alia</em>, facial and as-applied challenges to the ordinance under the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Takings Clause.  Although the District Court granted the city summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit abstained from ruling on the facial challenge under <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</em> v. <em>Pullman Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/index.html">312 U. S. 496</a>, because the pending state mandamus action could moot the federal question.  The court did, however, affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that the as-applied claim was unripe.  Back in state court, petitioners attempted to reserve the right to return to federal court for adjudication of their federal takings claims.  Ultimately, the California courts rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 various state-law takings claims, and they returned to the Federal District Court, advancing a series of federal takings claims that depended on issues identical to those previously resolved in the state courts.  In order to avoid being barred from suit by the general rule of issue preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt their federal takings claims from the reach of the full faith and credit statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738.  Relying on the <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank of Johnson City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html">473 U. S. 172</a>, 195, holding that takings claims are not ripe until a State fails \xe2\x80\x9cto provide adequate compensation for the taking,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners argued that, unless courts disregard \xc2\xa71738 in takings cases, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state court without any realistic possibility of ever obtaining federal review.  Holding, <em>inter alia,</em> that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial attack was barred by issue preclusion, the District Court reasoned that \xc2\xa71738 requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any state-court judgment that would have such effect under the State\xe2\x80\x99s laws.  The court added that because California courts had interpreted the relevant substantive state takings law coextensively with federal law, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 federal claims constituted the same claims the state courts had already resolved.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention that general preclusion principles should be cast aside whenever plaintiffs must litigate in state court under <em>Pullman</em> and/or <em>Williamson County</em>.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0This Court will not create an exception to the full faith and credit statute in order to provide a federal forum for litigants seeking to advance federal takings claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9323.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention that whenever plaintiffs reserve their federal takings claims in state court under <em>England</em> v. <em>Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/index.html">375 U. S. 411</a>, federal courts should review the reserved federal claims <em>de novo</em>, regardless of what issues the state court may have decided or how it may have decided them.  The <em>England </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical case\xe2\x80\x9d in which reservations of federal issues are appropriate makes clear that the decision was aimed at cases fundamentally distinct from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99.  <em>England </em>cases generally involve federal constitutional challenges to a state statute that can be avoided if a state court construes the statute in a particular manner.  <em>Id.,</em> at 420.  In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that is functionally identical to the federal question, but to avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-law determination that may moot the federal controversy.  See <em>id.</em>, at 416\xe2\x80\x93417, and n.\xc2\xa07.  Additionally, the Court made clear that the effective reservation of a federal claim was dependent on the condition that plaintiffs take no action to broaden the scope of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s review beyond deciding the antecedent state-law issue<em>.  Id.,</em> at 419.  Because the Ninth Circuit invoked <em>Pullman </em>abstention after determining that a ripe federal question existed as to the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial takings challenge, they were entitled to insulate from preclusive effect that one federal issue while they returned to state court to resolve their mandamus petition.  Petitioners, however, chose to advance broader issues than the limited ones in the mandamus petition, putting forth facial and as-applied takings challenges to the city ordinance in their state action.  By doing so, they effectively asked the state court to resolve the same federal issue they had previously asked it to reserve.  <em>England </em>does not support the exercise of any such right.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied takings claims fare no better.  The Ninth Circuit found those claims unripe under <em>Williamson County, </em>and therefore affirmed their dismissal.  They were never properly before the District Court, and there was no reason to expect that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedings.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Federal courts are not free to disregard \xc2\xa71738 simply to guarantee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federal court.  Petitioners misplace their reliance on the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Santini </em>decision, which held that parties who are forced to litigate their state-law takings claims in state court pursuant to <em>Williamson County</em> cannot be precluded from having those very claims resolved by a federal court.  The <em>Santini</em> court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is unpersuasive for several reasons.  First, both petitioners and <em>Santini</em> ultimately depend on an assumption that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federal claims in a federal forum.  This Court has repeatedly held to the contrary.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Allen</em> v. <em>McCurry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/index.html">449 U. S. 90</a>, 103\xe2\x80\x93104.  Second, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument assumes that courts may simply create exceptions to \xc2\xa71738 wherever they deem them appropriate.  However, this Court has held that no such exception will be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied partial repeal.  <em>E.g., Kremer</em> v. <em>Chemical Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/index.html">456 U. S. 461</a>, 468.  Congress has not expressed any intent to exempt federal takings claims from \xc2\xa71738.  Third, petitioners have overstated <em>Williamson County</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reach throughout this litigation.  Because they were never required to ripen in state court their claim that the city ordinance was facially invalid for failure to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, see <em>Yee </em>v.<em> Escondido,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 534, they could have raised the heart of their facial takings challenges directly in federal court.  With respect to those federal claims that did require ripening, petitioners are incorrect that <em>Williamson County</em> precludes state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s request for compensation under state law together with a claim that, in the alternative, the denial of compensation would violate the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738, for claims brought under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, who own and operate a hotel in San Francisco, California (hereinafter City), initiated this litigation in response to the application of a city ordinance that required them to pay a $567,000 \xe2\x80\x9cconversion fee\xe2\x80\x9d in 1996.  After the California courts rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 various state-law takings claims, they advanced in the Federal District Court a series of federal takings claims that depended on issues identical to those that had previously been resolved in the state-court action.  In order to avoid the bar of issue preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt from \xc2\xa71738\xe2\x80\x99s reach claims brought under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument is predicated on <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank of Johnson City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html">473 U.

Unless courts disregard \xc2\xa71738 in takings cases, petitioners argue, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state court without any realistic possibility of ever obtaining review in a federal forum.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of this argument conflicted with the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Santini </em>v. <em>Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service</em>, 342 F.\xc2\xa03d 118 (2003).  We granted certiorari<em> </em>to resolve the conflict, 543 U.

In December 1906, shortly after the great earthquake and fire destroyed most of the city, the hotel\xe2\x80\x94then called the \xe2\x80\x9cNew California Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94opened its doors to house dislocated individuals, immigrants, artists, and laborers.  The City officially licensed the facility to operate as a hotel and restaurant in 1916, and in 1922 the hotel was given its current name.  When the hotel fell into financial difficulties and a \xe2\x80\x9cdilapidated condition\xe2\x80\x9d in the early 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, Robert and Thomas Field purchased the facility, restored it, and began to operate it as a bed and breakfast inn.  See <em>San Remo Hotel, L. P.</em> v. <em>City and County of San Francisco</em>, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 5 (Cal. App. 2000) (officially depublished).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1979, San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Supervisors responded to \xe2\x80\x9ca severe shortage\xe2\x80\x9d of affordable rental housing for elderly, disabled, and low-income persons by instituting a moratorium on the conversion of residential hotel units into tourist units. San Francisco Residential Hotel Unit Conversion and Demolition Ordinance (hereinafter Hotel Conversion Ordinance or HCO) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa741.3(a)\xe2\x80\x93(g), Pet. for  Cert. 195a\xe2\x80\x93197a.  Two years later, the City enacted the first version of the Hotel Conversion Ordinance to regulate all future conversions.  San Francisco Ordinance No. 330\xe2\x80\x9381, codified in \xc2\xa741.1 <em>et seq.</em>  Under the 1981 version of the HCO, a hotel owner could convert residential units into tourist units only by obtaining a conversion permit.  And those permits could be obtained only by constructing new residential units, rehabilitating old ones, or paying an \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d fee into the City\xe2\x80\x99s Residential Hotel Preservation Fund Account.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa741.12\xe2\x80\x9341.13, Pet. for Cert. 224a\xe2\x80\x93231a.  The City substantially strengthened the HCO in 1990 by eliminating several exceptions that had existed in the 1981 version and increasing the size of the \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d fee hotel owners must pay when converting residential units.  See 145 F.\xc2\xa03d 1095, 1099 (CA9 1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The genesis of this protracted dispute lies in the 1981 HCO\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that each hotel \xe2\x80\x9cfile an initial unit usage report containing\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cnumber of residential and tourist units in the hotel[s] as of September 23, 1979.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa741.6(b)(1), Pet. for Cert. 206a.  Jean Iribarren was operating the San Remo Hotel, pursuant to a lease from petitioners, when this requirement came into effect.  Iribarren filed the initial usage report for the hotel, which erroneously reported that all of the rooms in the hotel were \xe2\x80\x9cresidential\xe2\x80\x9d units.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The consequence of that initial classification was that the City zoned the San Remo Hotel as \xe2\x80\x9cresidential hotel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, a hotel that consisted entirely of residential units.  And that zoning determination ultimately meant that, despite the fact that the San Remo Hotel had operated in practice as a tourist hotel for many years, 145 F. 3d, at 1100, petitioners were required to apply for a conditional use permit to do business officially as a \xe2\x80\x9ctourist hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d 27 Cal. 4th 643, 654, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d\n87, 94 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the HCO was revised in 1990, petitioners applied to convert all of the rooms in the San Remo Hotel into tourist use rooms under the relevant HCO provisions and requested a conditional use permit under the applicable zoning laws.  In 1993, the City Planning Commission granted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 requested conversion and conditional use permit, but only after imposing several conditions, one of which included the requirement that petitioners pay a $567,000 \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d fee.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioners appealed, arguing that the HCO requirement was unconstitutional and otherwise improperly applied to their hotel.  See <em>id.,</em> at 656, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 95.  The City Board of Supervisors rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 appeal on April 19, 1993.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 1993, Petitioners filed for a writ of administrative mandamus in California Superior Court.  That action lay dormant for several years, and the parties ultimately agreed to stay that action after petitioners filed for relief in Federal District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners filed in federal court for the first time on May 4, 1993.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 first amended complaint alleged four counts of due process (substantive and procedural) and takings (facial and as-applied)[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] violations under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, one count seeking damages under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, for those violations, and one pendent state-law claim.  The District Court granted respondents summary judgment.  As relevant to this action, the court found that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial takings claim was untimely under the applicable statute of limitations, and that the as-applied takings claim was unripe under <em>Williamson County, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html">473 U. S. 172</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, petitioners took the unusual position that the court should not decide their federal claims, but instead should abstain under <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</em> v. <em>Pullman Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/index.html">312 U. S. 496</a> (1941), because a return to state court could conceivably moot the remaining federal questions.  See App. 67\xe2\x80\x9368; see also 145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1101.  The Court of Appeals obliged petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request with respect to the facial challenge, a request that respondents apparently viewed as an \xe2\x80\x9coutrageous act of chutzpah.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1105.  That claim, the court reasoned, was \xe2\x80\x9cripe the instant the 1990 HCO was enacted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1102, and appropriate for <em>Pullman </em>abstention principally because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9centire case\xe2\x80\x9d hinged on the propriety of the planning commission\xe2\x80\x99s zoning designation\xe2\x80\x94the precise subject of the pending state mandamus action, 145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The court, however, affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied takings claim\xe2\x80\x94the claim that the application of the HCO to the San Remo Hotel violated the Takings Clause\xe2\x80\x94was unripe.  Because petitioners had failed to pursue an inverse condemnation action in state court, they had not yet been denied just compensation as contemplated by <em>Williamson County</em>.  145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the court appended a footnote stating that petitioners would be free to raise their federal takings claims in the California courts.  If, however, they wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cretain [their] right to return to federal court for adjudication of [their] federal claim, [they] must make an appropriate reservation in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1106, n. 7 (citations omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  That is precisely what petitioners attempted to do when they reactivated the dormant California case.  Yet petitioners advanced more than just the claims on which the federal court had abstained, and phrased their state claims in language that sounded in the rules and standards established and refined by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s takings jurisprudence.  Petitioners claimed, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9cimposition of the fee \xe2\x80\x98fails to substantially advance a legitimate government interest\xe2\x80\x99 and that \xe2\x80\x98[t]he amount of the fee imposed is not roughly proportional to the impact\xe2\x80\x99 of the proposed tourist use of the San Remo Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d  27 Cal. 4th, at 656, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 95 (quoting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 second amended state complaint).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state trial court dismissed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 amended complaint, but the intermediate appellate court reversed.  The court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the payment of the \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d fee effected a taking should have been evaluated under heightened scrutiny.  Under more exacting scrutiny, the fee failed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cessential nexus\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crough proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d tests because, <em>inter alia</em>, it was based on the original flawed designation that the San Remo Hotel was an entirely \xe2\x80\x9cresidential use\xe2\x80\x9d facility.  See <em>id.,</em> at 657\xe2\x80\x93658, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 96\xe2\x80\x9397 (summarizing appellate court opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Supreme Court reversed over the partial dissent of three justices.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The court initially noted that petitioners had reserved their federal causes of action and had sought no relief for any violation of the Federal Constitution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 649, n.\xc2\xa01, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 91, n.\xc2\xa01.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In the portion of its opinion discussing the Takings Clause of the California Constitution, however, the court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cwe appear to have construed the clauses congruently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 664, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 100\xe2\x80\x93101 (citing cases).  Accordingly, despite the fact that petitioners sought relief only under California law, the state court decided to \xe2\x80\x9canalyze their takings claim under the relevant decisions of both this court and the United States Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>., 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 101.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal constitutional issue debated by the parties was whether a heightened level of scrutiny applied to the claim that the housing replacement fee \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Lucas</em> v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/1003/index.html">505 U.

Rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that heightened scrutiny should apply, the court emphasized the distinction between discretionary exactions imposed by executive officials on an ad hoc basis and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generally applicable zoning regulations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislative determinations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  27 Cal. 4th, at 666\xe2\x80\x93668, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 102\xe2\x80\x93104 (quoting, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dolan</em>, 512 U. S., at 385, 391, n. 8).  The court situated the HCO within the latter category, reasoning that the ordinance relied upon fixed fees computed under a formula that is generally applicable to broad classes of property owners.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The court concluded that the less demanding \xe2\x80\x9creasonable relationship\xe2\x80\x9d test should apply to the HCO\xe2\x80\x99s monetary assessments, 27 Cal. 4th, at 671, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 105.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable relationship\xe2\x80\x9d test, the court upheld the HCO on its face and as-applied to petitioners.  As to the facial challenge, the court concluded that the HCO\xe2\x80\x99s mandated conversion fees \xe2\x80\x9cbear a reasonable relationship to the loss of housing . . . in the <em>generality </em>or <em>great majority </em>of cases. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 673, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 107.  With respect to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied challenge, the court concluded that the conversion fee was reasonably based on the number of units designated for conversion, which itself was based on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 own estimate that had been provided to the City in 1981 and had remained unchallenged for years.  <em>Id.</em>, at 678, and n. 17, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 110\xe2\x80\x93111, and n. 17.  The court therefore reversed the appellate court and reinstated the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order dismissing petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners did not seek a writ of certiorari from the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this Court.  Instead, they returned to Federal District Court by filing an amended complaint based on the complaint that they had filed prior to invoking <em>Pullman </em>abstention.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The District Court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial attack on the HCO was not only barred by the statute of limitations, but also by the general rule of issue preclusion.  See Pet. for Cert. 85a\xe2\x80\x9386a.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The District Court reasoned that 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738 requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any state-court judgment that would have preclusive effect under the laws of the State in which the judgment was rendered.  Because California courts had interpreted the relevant substantive state takings law coextensively with federal law, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 federal claims constituted the same claims that had already been resolved in state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  The court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention that general preclusion principles should be cast aside whenever plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cmust litigate in state court pursuant to <em>Pullman </em>and/or <em>Williamson County</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d 1088, 1096 (CA9 2004).  Relying on unambiguous Circuit precedent and the absence of any clearly contradictory decisions from this Court, the Court of Appeals found itself bound to apply general issue preclusion doctrine.  Given that general issue preclusion principles governed, the only remaining question was whether the District Court properly applied that doctrine; the court concluded that it did.  The court expressly rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention \xe2\x80\x9cthat California takings law is not coextensive with federal takings law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1096, and held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable relationship\xe2\x80\x9d test was an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98equivalent determination\xe2\x80\x99 of such claims under the federal takings clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1098.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We granted certiorari and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article IV, \xc2\xa71, of the United States Constitution demands that \xe2\x80\x9cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.

See <em>Williamson County,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html">473 U.

Therefore, the argument goes, whenever plaintiffs reserve their claims under <em>England</em> v. <em>Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/411/index.html"></a><a href="/us/375/411/index.html">375 U. S. 411</a> (1964), federal courts should review the reserved federal claims <em>de novo</em>, regardless of what issues the state court may have decided or how it may have decided them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention.  Although petitioners were certainly entitled to reserve some of their federal claims, as we shall explain, <em>England </em>does not support their erroneous expectation that their reservation would fully negate the preclusive effect of the state-court judgment with respect to any and all federal issues that might arise in the future federal litigation.  Federal courts, moreover, are not free to disregard 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738 simply to guarantee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federal court.  We turn first to <em>England</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>England</em> involved a group of plaintiffs who had graduated from chiropractic school, but sought to practice in Louisiana without complying with the educational requirements of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Medical Practice Act.  375 U. S., at 412.  They filed suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the Act.  The District Court invoked <em>Pullman </em>abstention and stayed the proceedings to enable the Louisiana courts to decide a preliminary and essential question of state law\xe2\x80\x94namely, whether the state statute applied at all to chiropractors.  375 U. S., at 413.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The state court, however, reached beyond the state-law question and held not only that the statute applied to the plaintiffs but also that its application was consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  The Federal District Court then dismissed the federal action without addressing the merits of the federal claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, we held that when a federal court abstains from deciding a federal constitutional issue to enable the state courts to address an antecedent state-law issue, the plaintiff may reserve his right to return to federal court for the disposition of his federal claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 419.  In that case, the antecedent state issue requiring abstention was <em>distinct </em>from the reserved federal issue.  See <em>id.</em>, at 418\xe2\x80\x93419. Our discussion of the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical case\xe2\x80\x9d in which reservations of federal issues are appropriate makes clear that our holding was limited to cases that are fundamentally distinct from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99.  \xe2\x80\x9cTypical\xe2\x80\x9d <em>England </em>cases generally involve federal constitutional challenges to a state statute that can be avoided if a state court construes the statute in a particular manner.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that is functionally identical to the federal question.  To the contrary, the purpose of <em>Pullman</em> abstention in such cases is to avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-law determination that may moot the federal controversy.  See 375 U. S., at 416\xe2\x80\x93417, and n.\xc2\xa07.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Additionally, our opinion made it perfectly clear that the effective reservation of a federal claim was dependent on the condition that plaintiffs take no action to broaden the scope of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s review beyond decision of the antecedent state-law issue.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding in <em>England </em>does not support petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to relitigate issues resolved by the California courts.  With respect to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial takings claims, the Court of Appeals invoked <em>Pullman </em>abstention after determining that a ripe federal question existed\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe facial takings challenge to the 1990 HCO.\xe2\x80\x9d  145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1105.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  It did so because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98land use planning is a sensitive area of social policy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 pending state mandamus action had the potential of mooting their facial challenge to the HCO by overturning the City\xe2\x80\x99s original classification of the San Remo Hotel as a \xe2\x80\x9cresidential\xe2\x80\x9d property.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, petitioners were entitled to insulate from preclusive effect one federal issue\xe2\x80\x94their facial constitutional challenge to the HCO\xe2\x80\x94while they returned to state court to resolve their petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, however, chose to advance broader issues than the limited issues contained within their state petition for writ of administrative mandamus on which the Ninth Circuit relied when it invoked <em>Pullman </em>abstention.  In their state action, petitioners advanced not only their request for a writ of administrative mandate, 27 Cal. 4th, at 653, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 93, but also their various claims that the HCO was unconstitutional on its face and as applied for (1) its failure to substantially advance a legitimate interest, (2) its lack of a nexus between the required fees and the ultimate objectives sought to be achieved via the ordinance, and (3) its imposition of an undue economic burden on individual property owners.  <em>Id</em>., at 672\xe2\x80\x93676, 41 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 106\xe2\x80\x93109.  By broadening their state action beyond the mandamus petition to include their \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d claims, petitioners effectively asked the state court to resolve the same federal issues they asked it to reserve.  <em>England </em>does not support the exercise of any such right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied takings claims fare no better.  As an initial matter, the Court of Appeals did not abstain with respect to those claims.  Instead, the court found that they were unripe under <em>Williamson County</em>.  The court therefore affirmed the district court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of those claims.  145 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1106.  Unlike their  \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d claims, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied claims were never properly before the District Court, and there was no reason to expect that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedings.  See <em>Allen</em>, 449 U. S., at 101, n.\xc2\xa017.  In short, our opinion in <em>England </em>does not support petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to circumvent \xc2\xa71738.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 ultimate submission, however, does not rely on <em>England</em> alone.  Rather, they argue that federal courts simply should not apply ordinary preclusion rules to state-court judgments when a case is forced into state court by the ripeness rule of <em>Williamson County</em>.  For support, petitioners rely on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Santini</em>, 342 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 130.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In <em>Santini</em>, the Second Circuit held that parties \xe2\x80\x9cwho litigate state-law takings claims in state court involuntarily\xe2\x80\x9d pursuant to <em>Williamson County</em> cannot be precluded from having those very claims resolved \xe2\x80\x9cby a federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  342 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 130.  The court did not rest its decision on any provision of the federal full faith and credit statute or our cases construing that law.  Instead, the court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would be both ironic and unfair if the very procedure that the Supreme Court required [plaintiffs] to follow before bringing a Fifth Amendment takings claim . . . also precluded [them] from ever bringing a Fifth Amendment takings claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We find this reasoning unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, both petitioners and <em>Santini</em> ultimately depend on an assumption that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federal claims in a federal forum.  We have repeatedly held, to the contrary, that issues actually decided in valid state-court judgments may well deprive plaintiffs of the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to have their federal claims relitigated in federal court.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Migra</em> v. <em>Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/75/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/75/index.html">465 U. S. 75</a>, 84 (1984); <em>Allen</em>, 449 U. S., at 103\xe2\x80\x93104.  This is so even when the plaintiff would have preferred not to litigate in state court, but was required to do so by statute or prudential rules.  See <em>id.,</em> at 104.  The relevant question in such cases is not whether the plaintiff has been afforded access to a federal forum; rather, the question is whether the state court actually decided an issue of fact or law that was necessary to its judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Allen</em>, the plaintiff, Willie McCurry, invoked the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in an unsuccessful attempt to suppress evidence in a state criminal trial.  After he was convicted, he sought to remedy his alleged constitutional violation by bringing a suit for damages under 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71983 against the officers who had entered his home.  Relying on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the special role of federal courts in protecting civil rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the fact that \xc2\xa71983 provided the \xe2\x80\x9conly route to a federal forum,\xe2\x80\x9d the court of appeals held that McCurry was entitled to a federal trial unencumbered by collateral estoppel.  449 U. S., at 93.  We rejected that argument emphatically.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe actual basis of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding appears to be a generally framed principle that every person asserting a federal right is entitled to one unencumbered opportunity to litigate that right in a federal district court, regardless of the legal posture in which the federal claim arises.  But the authority for this principle is difficult to discern.  It cannot lie in the Constitution, which makes no such guarantee, but leaves the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal district courts to the wisdom of Congress.  And no such authority is to be found in \xc2\xa71983 itself . . . .  There is, in short, no reason to believe that Congress intended to provide a person claiming a federal right an unrestricted opportunity to relitigate an issue already decided in state court simply because the issue arose in a state proceeding in which he would rather not have been engaged at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 103\xe2\x80\x93104.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Allen</em>, we are presently concerned only with issues <em>actually decided</em> by the state court that are dispositive of federal claims raised under \xc2\xa71983.  And, also as in <em>Allen, </em>it is clear that petitioners would have preferred not to have been forced to have their federal claims resolved by issues decided in state court.  Unfortunately for petitioners, it is entirely <em>unclear </em>why their preference for a federal forum should matter for constitutional or statutory purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only distinction between this case and <em>Allen </em>that is possibly relevant is the fact that petitioners here originally invoked the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court, which abstained on <em>Pullman </em>grounds while petitioners returned to state court.  But petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied takings claims were never properly before the District Court because they were unripe.  And, as we have already explained, the Court of Appeals invoked <em>Pullman </em>abstention only with respect to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d takings challenge, which petitioners then gratuitously presented to the state court.  At a bare minimum, with respect to the facial takings claim, petitioners were \xe2\x80\x9cin an offensive posture in [their] state court proceeding, and could have proceeded first in federal court had [they] wanted to litigate [their \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d] federal claim in a federal forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Migra, </em>465 U. S., at 85, n.\xc2\xa07.  Thus, the only distinction between this case and <em>Allen </em>is a distinction of no relevant significance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second reason we find petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument unpersuasive is that it assumes that courts may simply create exceptions to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738 wherever courts deem them appropriate.  Even conceding, <em>arguendo, </em>the laudable policy goal of making federal forums available to deserving litigants, we have expressly rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a fundamental departure from traditional rules of preclusion, enacted into federal law, can be justified only if plainly stated by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kremer</em> v. <em>Chemical Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/index.html">456 U. S. 461</a>, 485 (1982).  Our cases have therefore made plain that \xe2\x80\x9can exception to \xc2\xa71738 will not be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied partial repeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 468 (citing <em>Allen</em>, 449 U. S., at 99).  Even when the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s resort to state court is involuntary and the federal interest in denying finality is robust, we have held that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmust \xe2\x80\x98clearly manifest\xe2\x80\x99 its intent to depart from \xc2\xa71738.\xe2\x80\x9d  456 U. S., at 477.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same concerns animate our decision here.  Congress has not expressed any intent to exempt from the full faith and credit statute federal takings claims.  Consequently, we apply our normal assumption that the weighty interests in finality and comity trump the interest in giving losing litigants access to an additional appellate tribunal.  As we explained in <em>Federated Department Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moitie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/394/index.html">452 U. S. 394</a>, 401 (1981),</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwe do not see the grave injustice which would be done by the application of accepted principles of res judicata.  \xe2\x80\x98Simple justice\xe2\x80\x99 is achieved when a complex body of law developed over a period of years is evenhandedly applied.  The doctrine of res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual judge\xe2\x80\x99s ad\xc2\xa0hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.  There is simply \xe2\x80\x98no principle of law or equity which sanctions the rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of <em>res judicata</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Heiser</em> v. <em>Woodruff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/726/index.html">327 U.

Petitioners were never required to ripen the heart of their complaint\xe2\x80\x94the claim that the HCO was facially invalid because it failed to substantially advance a legitimate state interest\xe2\x80\x94in state court.

Petitioners therefore could have raised most of their facial takings challenges, which by their nature requested relief distinct from the provision of \xe2\x80\x9cjust compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d directly in federal court.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]<em> </em> Alternatively, petitioners had the option of reserving their facial claims while pursuing their as-applied claims along with their petition for writ of administrative mandamus.  Petitioners did not have the right, however, to seek state review of the same substantive issues they sought to reserve.  The purpose of  the <em>England </em>reservation is not to grant plaintiffs a second bite at the apple in their forum of choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to those federal claims that did require ripening, we reject petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contention that <em>Williamson County</em> forbids plaintiffs from advancing their federal claims in state courts.  The requirement that aggrieved property owners must seek \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so,\xe2\x80\x9d 473 U. S., at 194, does not preclude state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s request for compensation under state law and the claim that, in the alternative, the denial of compensation would violate the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  Reading <em>Williamson County </em>to preclude plaintiffs from raising such claims in the alternative would erroneously interpret our cases as requiring property owners to \xe2\x80\x9cresort to piecemeal litigation or otherwise unfair procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates</em> v. <em>Yolo County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/340/index.html">477 U. S. 340</a>, 350, n. 7 (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is hardly a radical notion to recognize that, as a practical matter, a significant number of plaintiffs will necessarily litigate their federal takings claims in state courts.  It was settled well before <em>Williamson County </em>that \xe2\x80\x9ca claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  473 U. S., at 186.  As a consequence, there is scant precedent for the litigation in federal district court of claims that a state agency has taken property in violation of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s takings clause.  To the contrary, most of the cases in our takings jurisprudence, including nearly all of the cases on which petitioners rely, came to us on writs of certiorari from state courts of last resort.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, this is not the only area of law in which we have recognized limits to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to press their federal claims in federal courts.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a>, 116 (1981) (holding that taxpayers are \xe2\x80\x9cbarred by the principle of comity from asserting \xc2\xa71983 actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  State courts are fully competent to adjudicate constitutional challenges to local land-use decisions.  Indeed, state courts undoubtedly have more experience than federal courts do in resolving the complex factual, technical, and legal questions related to zoning and land-use regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At base, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim amounts to little more than the concern that it is unfair to give preclusive effect to state-court proceedings that are not chosen, but are instead <em>required</em> in order to ripen federal takings claims.  Whatever the merits of that concern may be, we are not free to disregard the full faith and credit statute solely to preserve the availability of a federal forum.  The Court of Appeals was correct to decline petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to ignore the requirements of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n<right><em>It is so ordered<right></right></em></right></p><em>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although petitioners asked this Court to review two separate questions, our grant of certiorari was limited exclusively to the question whether \xe2\x80\x9ca Fifth Amendment Takings claim [is] barred by issue preclusion based on a judgment denying compensation solely under state law, which was rendered in a state court proceeding that was required to ripen the federal Takings claim?\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.

Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not \xe2\x80\x9cclaim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 195\xe2\x80\x93196.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not clear to me that <em>Williamson County</em> was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in<em> Williamson County</em> purported to interpret the Fifth Amendment in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 194, n. 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a \xc2\xa71983 action\xe2\x80\x9d).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.  <em>Suitum</em> v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/725/index.html">520 U. S. 725</a>, 733\xe2\x80\x93734 (1997).  It is not obvious that either constitutional or prudential principles require claimants to utilize all state compensation procedures before they can bring a federal takings claim.  Cf. <em>Patsy</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/index.html">457 U. S. 496</a>, 516 (1982) (holding that plaintiffs suing under \xc2\xa71983 are not required to have exhausted state administrative remedies).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today attempts to shore up the state-litigation requirement by referring to <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981).  <em>Ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  There, we held that the principle of comity (reflected in the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341) bars taxpayers from asserting \xc2\xa71983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  <em>Id.</em>, at 102\xe2\x80\x93103, 107\xe2\x80\x93113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation,\xe2\x80\x9d a principle which predated the enactment of \xc2\xa71983 itself.  <em>Id.</em>, at 103, 107\xe2\x80\x93114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.  <em>Id.</em>, at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time <em>Williamson County</em> was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in <em>Fair Assessment</em>.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the First Amendment, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Renton</em> v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/41/index.html">475 U. S. 41</a> (1986); <em>Young</em> v. <em>American Mini Theatres, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/50/index.html">427 U. S. 50</a> (1976), or the Equal Protection Clause, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cleburne</em> v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html">473 U. S. 432</a> (1985); <em>Village of Belle Terre</em> v. <em>Boraas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/1/index.html">416 U. S. 1</a> (1974).  In short, the affirmative case for the state-litigation requirement has yet to be made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, <em>Williamson County</em>\xe2\x80\x99s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.\xc2\xa0 <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the <em>Rooker</em>-<em>Feldman</em> doctrine might, insofar as <em>Williamson County</em> can be read to characterize the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 denial of compensation as a required element of the Fifth Amendment takings claim.  See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Saudi Basic Industries Corp.</em>, 544 U. S. ___ (2005).  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em>, at 22, <em>Williamson</em> <em>County</em> all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federal courts to enforce the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s just compensation guarantee.  The basic principle that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and to adjudicate federal takings claims is sound, see <em>ante</em>, at 23, and would apply to any number of federal claims.  Cf. 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 (providing for limited federal habeas review of state-court adjudications of alleged violations of the Constitution).  But that principle does not explain why federal takings claims in particular should be singled out to be confined to state court, in the absence of any asserted justification or congressional directive.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I joined the opinion of the Court in <em>Williamson County</em>.  But further reflection and experience lead me to think that the justifications for its state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic.  Here, no court below has addressed the correctness of <em>Williamson County</em>, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolving the issue could not benefit petitioners.  In an appropriate case, I believe the Court should reconsider whether plaintiffs asserting a Fifth Amendment takings claim based on the final decision of a state or local government entity must first seek compensation in state courts.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In creating the state-litigation rule, the Court, in addition to relying on the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, analogized to <em>Ruckelshaus</em> v. <em>Monsanto Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/index.html">467 U. S. 986</a> (1984), and <em>Parratt</em> v. <em>Taylor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/527/index.html">451 U. S. 527</a> (1981).  As several of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <em>amici</em> in this case have urged, those cases provided limited support for the state-litigation requirement.  See Brief for Defenders of Property Rights et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 9\xe2\x80\x9312; Brief for Elizabeth J. Neumont et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 10\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, in some States the courts themselves apply the state-litigation requirement from <em>Williamson County</em> <em>Regional Planning Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/172/index.html">473 U. S. 172</a> (1985), refusing to entertain any federal takings claim until the claimant receives a final denial of compensation through all the available state procedures.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Breneric Assoc.</em> v. <em>City of Del Mar</em>, 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188\xe2\x80\x93189, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324, 338\xe2\x80\x93339 (1998); <em>Melillo</em> v. <em>City of New Haven</em>, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A.\xc2\xa02d 133, 138, n. 28 (1999).  This precludes litigants from asserting their federal takings claim even in <em>state</em> court.  The Court tries to avoid this anomaly by asserting that, for plaintiffs attempting to raise a federal takings claim in state court as an alternative to their state claims,<em> Williamson County</em> does not command that the state courts themselves impose the state-litigation requirement.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  But that is so only if <em>Williamson County</em>\xe2\x80\x99s state-litigation requirement is merely a prudential rule, and not a constitutional mandate, a question that the Court today conspicuously leaves open.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
