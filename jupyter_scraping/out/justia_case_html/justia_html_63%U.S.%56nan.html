The first of these sources was the Congressional township fund and the lands belonging thereto.  Then followed an enumeration of ten different sources from which revenue was derived, all of which were united into one common fund.  This was directed, by an act of the legislature, to be apportioned amongst the several counties of the state, according to the enumeration of scholars therein, without taking into consideration the Congressional township fund in such distribution.</p>\n<p>But the constitution also contained the following section, being section seven, in the eighth article, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p>"All trust funds held by the state shall remain inviolate, and be faithfully and exclusively applied to the purposes for which the trust was created."</p>\n<p>It is evident that, under this act of the legislature, Springfield Township might have received less than the interest of the sum for which section sixteen had been sold, the proceeds of which had been invested.

The case is reported in 7 Ind. 636. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 63 U. S. 68</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act declares that where is drawn in question the construction of any statute of the United States and the decision is against the right set up or claimed by either party under the act of Congress, such decision may be reexamined, and reversed or affirmed, in the Supreme Court on writ of error.</p>\n<p>Here it is claimed for the inhabitants of the township that the fund arising from the proceeds of the sixteenth section shall not be estimated in distributing the general school fund of the state derived from taxes paid into the state treasury.  The acts of the legislature equalize the amount that shall be appropriated for the education of each scholar throughout the state, taking into the estimate the moneys derived from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 63 U. S. 69</a></p><p> the proceeds of the sixteenth section, with the proviso, that the whole of the proceeds shall be expended in the township.  If it be <em>more,</em> then an equal portion to each scholar elsewhere furnished by the state fund -- still the township has the benefit of such excess, but receives nothing from the treasury, and if it be less, then the deficiency is made up, so as to equalize according to the general provision.</p>\n<p>And the question here is whether the state laws violate the acts of Congress providing that the proceeds of the sixteenth section shall be for the use of schools in the township.  And our opinion is that expending the proceeds of the sixteenth section for the exclusive use of schools "in the township" where the section exists is a compliance with the legislation of Congress on the subject; nor is the state bound to provide any additional fund for a township receiving the bounty of Congress, no matter to what extent other parts of the state are supplied from the treasury.</p>\n<p>The law is a perfectly just one, but if it were otherwise and the school fund was distributed partially, nevertheless those receiving the bounty from Congress have no right to call on this Court to interfere with the power exercised by the state legislature in laying and collecting taxes and in appropriating them for educational purposes, at its discretion.</p>\n<p>We hold that a true construction was given to the acts of Congress referred to, and order that the judgment be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
