Reported below:  407 A.2d 198.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>The appeal is dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE WHITE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Appellants, a half brother and sister, are the natural parents of five children who were in the custody of the Division of Social Services of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services at the beginning of this litigation. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  After determining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 450 U. S. 383</a></p><p> that the children should be put up for adoption, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the Division filed suit pursuant to Delaware law to obtain termination of appellants\' parental rights over their children.  The Superior Court of Delaware ordered termination, and the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Appellants appealed to this Court, arguing that the termination order and the Delaware statute authorizing it were unconstitutional.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  445 U.S. 942 (1980).</p>\n<p>The Court today dismisses this appeal for want of a properly presented federal question, thereby permitting the termination order to remain in effect despite the existence of a substantial federal constitutional challenge to the Delaware statutory scheme under which the order was entered. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Because I believe that the federal question <em>was</em> properly presented within the definition of that requirement in our cases, I dissent from this dismissal.  Instead, I would vacate the judgment below and remand for reconsideration in light of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 450 U. S. 384</a></p><p> supervening changes in the factual circumstances and the applicable state law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants challenge the constitutionality of certain portions of the former Del.Code Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1101-1112 (1975), in effect while this litigation was pending in the state courts.  These provisions established a</p>\n<p>"procedure for termination of parental rights for the purpose of adoption or, if a suitable adoption plan cannot be effected, for the purpose of providing for the care of the child by some other plan which may or may not contemplate the continued possibility of eventual adoption."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1103.  Petitions for termination of parental rights could be filed by certain specified categories of persons, including the Division.  \xc2\xa7 1104(8).  Upon a finding by the Superior Court that the parents were "not fitted to continue to exercise parental rights," \xc2\xa7 1103(4), and that termination of existing parental rights would be "in the best interests of the child," the court was required to issue an order of termination, and to transfer parental rights to another person, organization, or agency.  \xc2\xa7 1108(a).  The effect of the termination order was</p>\n<p>"that all of the rights, duties, privileges and obligations recognized by law between the [parents] and the child shall forever thereafter cease to exist as fully and to all intents and purposes as if the child and the [parents] were and always had been strangers."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1112.  Either an order of termination or the consent of the natural parents was required before children in the custody of the State could be placed for adoption.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 907-908.</p>\n<p>Appellants argue here, as they did at each stage of the litigation in the state courts, that this statutory scheme for termination of parental rights was invalid under the United States Constitution.  Specifically, they contend:  (1) that Del.Code Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa7 1103(4) (1975), which provides for such termination where the parent is "not fitted," is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite; (2) that a higher </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 450 U. S. 385</a></p><p> standard than the mere "preponderance of the evidence" is required to terminate parental rights; and (3) that substantive due process forbids termination of parental rights in the absence of a demonstration of a compelling state interest, in the form of specific findings of existing or threatened injury to the child. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  There is no doubt that appellants raised their federal constitutional claim in a timely manner in both the Superior Court [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the Supreme Court [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] of Delaware, nor that the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly considered and rejected the federal constitutional challenge. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Dismissal of this appeal for want of a properly presented federal question is, therefore, unwarranted.  The practice in this Court has been to dismiss an appeal taken under 28 U. S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2) for want of a properly presented federal question only when the federal question was not raised at the proper juncture in the state court proceedings or in accordance with reasonable state rules.  <em>Jones v.

S. 388</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The living situation of appellants and their children has changed dramatically since the trial court proceedings in this case.  Doe and Roe have ceased to live together, thus ending the incestuous relationship that formed the predicate for the Superior Court\'s original judgment of unfitness.  <em>See</em> App. to Juris.Statement 5b.  According to their attorney, Doe now resides in another State, while Roe has married and now lives with her husband and his child in Delaware.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4.  Doe and Roe have not seen their five children since 1975. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The children, who ranged in age from 11 months to 4 years old when the Superior Court issued its first order of termination in 1975, are now about 6 to 9 years old.  The children have never lived together as a family, and are now in four separate placements.  Appellants\' attorney stated at oral argument that "the eventual goal of the mother" is to obtain custody of her children, and that she would permit the father to visit them.  <em>Id.</em> at 3.  There is no evidence on any of these matters in the record, because it has been closed since December, 1976.  <em>Id.</em> at 39.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Del.Code Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa7 1103 (1975), was amended, effective July 11, 1980, to alter the standard for termination of parental rights.  Instead of requiring a finding of "unfitness" as a predicate for termination, the new statute provides for termination if the parents "are not able, or have failed, to plan adequately for the child\'s physical needs or his mental and emotional health and development" and:</p>\n<p>"a. In the case of a child in the care of an authorized agency:"</p>\n<p>"1. The child has been in the care of an authorized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 450 U.

The conditions which led to the child\'s placement still persist, and there appears to be little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied at an early date so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future."</p>\n<p>"b.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>As stated in <em>Bell v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/226/case.html">378 U.

That policy provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 450 U. S. 393</a></p><p> some support for the Court\'s otherwise inexplicable conclusion that the three federal questions raised by this appeal are somehow not "properly presented." [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  That policy also would provide some support for JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s view that this case should be remanded to the Delaware courts for further proceedings before this Court addresses any of the federal issues.  In my opinion, however, both the Court\'s disposition and JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s proposed disposition are inadequately supported by that policy, because adjudication of one of the federal questions presented in this case would be neither premature nor unnecessary.</p>\n<p>To explain my position, I shall focus on the question whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the termination of parental rights be supported by a higher standard of proof than a mere preponderance of the evidence. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  For the reasons stated by the Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 450 U. S. 394</a></p><p> in <em>Addington v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html">441 U. S. 418</a></span>, that question is undeniably substantial.  For the reasons stated by JUSTICE BRENNAN, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/382/case.html#384">450 U. S. 384</a></span>-387, there is no procedural defect in the record that provides a legitimate basis for the Court\'s conclusion that the question is not "properly presented" in this case.  In my opinion, the Court has the duty to decide that question now, because there is no reason to believe that delay will affect either the character of the question or the necessity of deciding it in this case.  Unlike JUSTICE BRENNAN, I believe that neither the change in the status of the appellants nor the change in the Delaware statute justifies a remand for further state court proceedings without first deciding whether the Federal Constitution requires that an order terminating parental rights be supported by clear and convincing evidence.  Neither in the Supreme Court of Delaware nor in this Court have appellants argued that the change in their living situation subsequent to the entry of the termination order is a sufficient basis for setting aside that order. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Of course, if there is an independent basis for vacating the order -- or if the state court decided to rely on postjudgment events to set aside its own decision -- a new proceeding to determine the welfare of appellants\' children undoubtedly should consider </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 450 U. S. 395</a></p><p> recent, as well as ancient, history.  I do not believe, however. that such recent events -- which are unrelated to the federal questions that support our appellate jurisdiction -- provide an appropriate basis for this Court to exercise its power to vacate the judgment of the Delaware Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Nor, in my opinion, does the enactment of the new Delaware statute make it appropriate for us to vacate the judgment of the Delaware Supreme Court.  This is not a case like <em>Bell v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/226/case.html">378 U. S. 226</a></span>, in which the State has made lawful the conduct that formed the basis of a criminal conviction pending on appeal, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] or otherwise has taken action that significantly changed the federal question presented by an appeal to this Court.  None of the parties and none of the many <em>amici curiae</em> suggest that the new Delaware statute has changed the standard of proof required by Delaware law.

S. 396</a></p><p> If it was unconstitutional to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard at the 1972 termination proceeding, it would be equally unconstitutional to apply that standard at a new proceeding held under the revised statute.  Because the constitutionality of applying that standard in a case of this kind is now squarely at issue, I believe we have the power and the obligation to resolve this federal question <em>before</em> any further proceedings are conducted.</p>\n<p>As the Court stated in <em>Patterson v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/600/case.html">294 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/600/case.html#607">294 U.

In my judgment, justice requires that we promptly resolve the critical federal question properly presented in this case, because this litigation involves the family status of growing children [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] and because this federal question is certain to reappear before us in the same form at a later date.  Accordingly, I would decide the standard of proof question and, thereafter, either remand to the Delaware Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 450 U.

I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants raise three constitutional objections to the termination order entered against them.  <em>See</em> BRENNAN, J., dissenting, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/382/case.html#384">450 U.

Is the Delaware statute, which provides for the permanent termination of the parent-child relationship where the parent is \'not fitted,\' unconstitutionally vague and indefinite in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?"</p>\n<p>"2. In light of the protected nature of the family relationship under decisions of this Court, does the Due Process Clause and this Court\'s decision in <em>Addington v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/441/418/case.html">441 U. S. 418</a></span> (1979), preclude the termination of the parent-child relationship based upon a mere \'preponderance of the evidence\'?"</p>\n<p>"3.

Because the substance of the unfitness standard has been revised in the new statute, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/382/case.html#388">450 U.

The new statutory language would clearly be relevant to these questions if, as a matter of state law, the new statute is applicable in this termination proceeding.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants did not seek a remand in the Delaware Supreme Court based upon the change in their status.  <em>See</em> BRENNAN, J., dissenting, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/382/case.html#391">450 U. S. 391</a></span>, n. 16. T hat court was informed of the changed circumstances, <em>see</em> App. to Juris.Statement 5a; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-14, 29-30, but it apparently concluded that the new circumstances did not warrant a remand to the trial court in the absence of a request by one of the parties.  In their opening brief in this Court, appellants do not even mention that the factual circumstances have changed, and, in their reply brief, they allude to their present status only in the vaguest of terms.  It was only at oral argument that appellants\' counsel squarely addressed the details of their present living situation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court noted in <em>Bell:</em></p>\n<p>"Petitioners\' convictions were affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals on January 9, 1962.  Since that date, Maryland has enacted laws that abolish the crime of which petitioners were convicted."</p>\n<p>378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/226/case.html#228">378 U. S. 228</a></span>.  In addition, it is not at all clear that the Delaware courts would regard the enactment of the new statute as a reason to modify or vacate the termination order entered against appellants.  In <em>Bell,</em> the Court emphasized the fact that, under Maryland law, the supervening change in the governing criminal statute probably would result in reversal of the petitioners\' convictions by the state courts.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/226/case.html#230">378 U. S. 230</a></span>-237.  In this case, we do not know what effect, if any, the new statute is likely to have on termination proceedings initiated and substantially completed prior to its enactment.  The State of Delaware, in its brief in this Court, has not suggested that the new statute has any bearing, as a matter of state law, on this litigation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Both the original and the revised statutes are silent with respect to the standard of proof applicable in termination proceedings.  The Delaware Supreme Court, in its consideration of the standard of proof issue in this case, did not rely upon any specific language of the termination statute, but rather based its conclusion primarily upon the civil, nonpenal nature of termination proceedings in Delaware.  <em>See</em> App. to Juris.Statement 9-1la; <em>In re Five Minor Children,</em> 407 A.2d 198, 200 (1979).  Nothing on the face of the new statute suggests that it will be interpreted to change the civil nature of Delaware termination proceedings.  Thus, even if the new statute would be applicable in this case as a matter of state law, the federal constitutional question would remain the same.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The initial termination order was entered in 1975.  Appellants have not seen their five children, now ranging in age from 6 to 9 years old, since that time.  The children are presently in four separate foster homes, and apparently have never lived together as a family.  Because of the pendency of this proceeding, the children have been separated from each other and from their natural parents, and also have been ineligible for adoption because of the statutory requirement that the rights of the natural parents be finally terminated before adoption can take place without their consent.  <em>See</em> Del.Code Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 907, 908 (1975).  Further dely in a proceeding of this nature may well frustrate whatever hope remains that these children will ever be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and permanent family environment.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
