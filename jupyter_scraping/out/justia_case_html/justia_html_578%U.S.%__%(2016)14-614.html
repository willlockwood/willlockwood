In Maryland and other States that have deregulated their energy markets, \xe2\x80\x9cload serving entities\xe2\x80\x9d (LSEs) purchase electricity at wholesale from independent power generators for delivery to retail consumers.  Interstate wholesale transactions in deregulated markets typically occur through (1) bilateral contracting, where LSEs agree to purchase a certain amount of electricity from generators at a certain rate over a certain period of time; and (2) competitive wholesale auctions administered by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs), nonprofit entities that manage certain segments of the electricity grid.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">PJM Interconnection (PJM), an RTO overseeing a multistate grid, operates a capacity auction.  The capacity auction is designed to identify need for new generation and to accommodate long-term bilateral contracts for capacity.  PJM predicts demand three years into the future and assigns a share of that demand to each participating LSE.  Owners of capacity to produce electricity in three years\xe2\x80\x99 time then bid that capacity into the auction for sale to PJM at rates the sellers set in their bids.  PJM accepts bids until it has purchased enough capacity to satisfy anticipated demand.  All accepted capacity sellers receive the highest accepted rate, called the \xe2\x80\x9cclearing price.\xe2\x80\x9d  LSEs then must purchase, from PJM, enough electricity to satisfy their assigned share of overall projected demand.  FERC extensively regulates the structure of the capacity auction to ensure that it efficiently balances supply and demand, producing a just and reasonable clearing price.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D"><b>Concerned that the PJM capacity auction was failing to encourage development of sufficient new in-state generation, Maryland enacted its own regulatory program.  Maryland selected, through a proposal process, petitioner CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), to construct a new power plant and required LSEs to enter into a 20-year pricing contract (called a contract for differences) with CPV at a rate CPV specified in its proposal.  Under the terms of the contract, CPV sells its capacity to PJM through the auction, but\xe2\x80\x94through mandated payments from or to LSEs\xe2\x80\x94receives the contract price rather than the clearing price for these sales to PJM.  In a suit filed by incumbent generators (respondents here) against members of the Maryland Public Service Commission\xe2\x80\x94CPV intervened as a defendant\xe2\x80\x94the District Court issued a declaratory judgment holding that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program improperly sets the rate CPV receives for interstate wholesale capacity sales to PJM.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.  </b></p><b>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program is preempted because it disregards the interstate wholesale rate FERC requires.  A state law is preempted where \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Northwest Central Pipeline Corp.</i> v. <i>State Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Kan.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 493\n, as well as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98where, under the circumstances of [a] particular case, [the challenged state law] stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Crosby</i> v. <i>National Foreign Trade Council</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 363\n.  Exercising its exclusive authority over interstate wholesale sales, see\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824(b)(1), FERC has approved PJM\xe2\x80\x99s capacity auction as the sole ratesetting mechanism for capacity sales to PJM, and has deemed the clearing price <i>per\xc2\xa0se </i>just and reasonable.  However, Maryland\xe2\x80\x94through the contract for differences\xe2\x80\x94guarantees CPV a rate distinct from the clearing price for its interstate capacity sales to PJM.  By adjusting an interstate wholesale rate, Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program contravenes the FPA\xe2\x80\x99s division of authority between state and federal regulators.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">That Maryland was attempting to encourage construction of new in-state generation does not save its program.  States may regulate within their assigned domain even when their laws incidentally affect areas within FERC\xe2\x80\x99s domain.  But they may not seek to achieve ends, however legitimate, through regulatory means that intrude on FERC\xe2\x80\x99s authority over interstate wholesale rates, as Maryland has done here.  See <i>Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.</i> v. <i>Mississippi ex rel. Moore</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 354\n; <i>Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co.</i> v. <i>Thornburg</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 953\n.  Maryland and CPV analogize the contract for differences to traditional bilateral contracts for capacity.  Unlike traditional bilateral contracts, however, the contract for differences does not transfer ownership of capacity from one party to another outside the auction.  Instead, Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program operates within the auction, mandating LSEs and CPV to exchange money based on the cost of CPV\xe2\x80\x99s capacity sales to PJM.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program is rejected only because it disregards an interstate wholesale rate required by FERC.  Neither Maryland nor other States are foreclosed from encouraging production of new or clean generation through measures that do not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the auction.

FERC\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory scheme includes an auction-based market mechanism to ensure wholesale rates that are just and reasonable.  FERC\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, in Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s view, provided insufficient incentive for new electricity generation in the State.  Maryland therefore enacted its own regulatory program.  Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program provides subsidies, through state-mandated contracts, to a new generator, but conditions receipt of those subsidies on the new generator selling capacity into a FERC-regulated wholesale auction.  In a suit initiated by competitors of Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s new electricity generator, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s scheme impermissibly intrudes upon the wholesale electricity market, a domain Congress reserved to FERC alone.

A wholesale sale is defined as a \xe2\x80\x9csale of electric energy to any person for resale.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7824(d).  The FPA assigns to FERC responsibility for ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be just and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7824d(a).

Until relatively recently, most state energy markets were vertically integrated monopolies\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, one entity, often a state utility, controlled electricity generation, transmission, and sale to retail consumers.  Over the past few decades, many States, including Maryland, have deregulated their energy markets.  In deregulated markets, the organizations that deliver electricity to retail consumers\xe2\x80\x94often called \xe2\x80\x9cload serving entities\xe2\x80\x9d (LSEs)\xe2\x80\x94purchase that electricity at wholesale from independent power generators.  To ensure reliable transmission of electricity from independent generators to LSEs, FERC has charged nonprofit entities, called Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs), with managing certain segments of the electricity grid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Interstate wholesale transactions in deregulated markets typically occur through two mechanisms.  The first is bilateral contracting: LSEs sign agreements with generators to purchase a certain amount of electricity at a certain rate over a certain period of time.  After the parties have agreed to contract terms, FERC may review the rate for reasonableness.  See <i>Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.</i> v. <i>Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty.</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 527\n\xe2\x80\x93548 (2008) (Because rates set through good-faith arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length negotiation are presumed reasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cFERC may abrogate a valid contract only if it harms the public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, RTOs and ISOs administer a number of competitive wholesale auctions: for example, a \xe2\x80\x9csame-day auction\xe2\x80\x9d for immediate delivery of electricity to LSEs facing a sudden spike in demand; a \xe2\x80\x9cnext-day auction\xe2\x80\x9d to satisfy LSEs\xe2\x80\x99 anticipated near-term demand; and a \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity auction\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure the availability of an adequate supply of power at some point far in the future.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These cases involve the capacity auction administered by PJM Interconnection (PJM), an RTO that oversees the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 mid-Atlantic and Midwestern States and the District of Columbia.  The PJM capacity auction functions as follows.  PJM predicts electricity demand three years ahead of time, and assigns a share of that demand to each participating LSE.  Owners of capacity to produce electricity in three years\xe2\x80\x99 time bid to sell that capacity to PJM at proposed rates.  PJM accepts bids, beginning with the lowest proposed rate, until it has purchased enough capacity to satisfy projected demand.  No matter what rate they listed in their original bids, all accepted capacity sellers receive the highest accepted rate, which is called the \xe2\x80\x9cclearing price.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  LSEs then must purchase from PJM, at the clearing price, enough electricity to satisfy their PJM-assigned share of overall projected demand.  The capacity auction serves to identify need for new generation: A high clearing price in the capacity auction encourages new generators to enter the market, increasing supply and thereby lowering the clearing price in same-day and next-day auctions three years\xe2\x80\x99 hence; a low clearing price discourages new entry and encourages retirement of existing high-cost generators.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The auction is designed to accommodate long-term bilateral contracts for capacity.  If an LSE has acquired a certain amount of capacity through a long-term bilateral contract with a generator, the LSE\xe2\x80\x94not the generator\xe2\x80\x94is considered the owner of that capacity for purposes of the auction.  The LSE sells that capacity into the auction, where it counts toward the LSE\xe2\x80\x99s assigned share of PJM-projected demand, thereby reducing the net costs of the LSE\xe2\x80\x99s required capacity purchases from PJM.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  LSEs generally bid their capacity into the auction at a price of $0, thus guaranteeing that the capacity will clear at any price.  Such bidders are called \xe2\x80\x9cprice takers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the fixed costs of building generating facilities often vastly exceed the variable costs of producing electricity, many generators also function as price takers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">FERC extensively regulates the structure of the PJM capacity auction to ensure that it efficiently balances supply and demand, producing a just and reasonable clearing price.  See <i>EPSA</i>,<i> </i>577 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (the clearing price is \xe2\x80\x9cthe price an efficient market would produce\xe2\x80\x9d).  Two FERC rules are particularly relevant to these cases.  First, the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) requires new generators to bid capacity into the auction at or above a price specified by PJM, unless those generators can prove that their actual costs fall below the MOPR price.  Once a new generator clears the auction at the MOPR price, PJM deems that generator an efficient entrant and exempts it from the MOPR going forward, allowing it to bid its capacity into the auction at any price it elects, including $0.  Second, the New Entry Price Adjustment (NEPA) guarantees new generators, under certain circumstances, a stable capacity price for their first three years in the market.  The NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee eliminates, for three years, the risk that the new generator\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the auction might so decrease the clearing price as to prevent that generator from recovering its costs.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Around 2009, Maryland electricity regulators became concerned that the PJM capacity auction was failing to encourage development of sufficient new in-state generation.  Because Maryland sits in a particularly congested part of the PJM grid, importing electricity from other parts of the grid into the State is often difficult.  To address this perceived supply shortfall, Maryland regulators proposed that FERC extend the duration of the NEPA from three years to ten.  FERC rejected the proposal.  <i>PJM</i>, 126 FERC \xc2\xb662,563 (2009).  \xe2\x80\x9c[G]iving new suppliers longer payments and assurances unavailable to existing suppliers,\xe2\x80\x9d FERC reasoned, would improperly favor new generation over existing generation, throwing the auction\xe2\x80\x99s market-based price-setting mechanism out of balance.  <i>Ibid.  </i>See also <i>PJM</i>,<i> </i>128 FERC \xc2\xb661,789 (2009) (order on petition for rehearing) (\xe2\x80\x9cBoth new entry and retention of existing efficient capacity are necessary to ensure reliability and both should receive the same price so that the price signals are not skewed in favor of new entry.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shortly after FERC rejected Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s NEPA proposal, the Maryland Public Service Commission promulgated the Generation Order at issue here.  Under the order, Maryland solicited proposals from various companies for construction of a new gas-fired power plant at a particular location, and accepted the proposal of petitioner CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV).  Maryland then required LSEs to enter into a 20-year pricing contract (the parties refer to this contract as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract for differences\xe2\x80\x9d) with CPV at a rate CPV specified in its accepted proposal.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Unlike a traditional bilateral contract for capacity, the contract for differences does not transfer ownership of capacity from CPV to the LSEs.  Instead, CPV sells its capacity on the PJM market, but Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program guarantees CPV the contract price rather than the auction clearing price.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If CPV\xe2\x80\x99s capacity clears the PJM capacity auction and the clearing price falls below the price guaranteed in the contract for differences, Maryland LSEs pay CPV the difference between the contract price and the clearing price.  The LSEs then pass the costs of these required payments along to Maryland consumers in the form of higher retail prices.  If CPV\xe2\x80\x99s capacity clears the auction and the clearing price exceeds the price guaranteed in the contract for differences, CPV pays the LSEs the difference between the contract price and the clearing price, and the LSEs then pass the savings along to consumers in the form of lower retail prices.  Because CPV sells its capacity exclusively in the PJM auction market, CPV receives no payment from Maryland LSEs or PJM if its capacity fails to clear the auction.  But CPV is guaranteed a certain rate if its capacity does clear, so the contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms encourage CPV to bid its capacity into the auction at the lowest possible price.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Prior to enactment of the Maryland program, PJM had exempted new state-supported generation from the MOPR, allowing such generation to bid capacity into the auction at $0 without first clearing at the MOPR price.  Responding to a complaint filed by incumbent generators in the Maryland region who objected to Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program (and the similar New Jersey program), FERC eliminated this exemption.  <i>PJM</i>, 135 FERC \xc2\xb661,106 (2011).  See also 137 FERC \xc2\xb661,145 (2011) (order on petition for rehearing) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur intent is not to pass judgment on state and local policies and objectives with regard to the development of new capacity resources, or unreasonably interfere with those objectives.  We are forced to act, however, when subsidized entry supported by one state\xe2\x80\x99s or locality\xe2\x80\x99s policies has the effect of disrupting the competitive price signals that PJM\xe2\x80\x99s [capacity auction] is designed to produce, and that PJM as a whole, including other states, rely on to attract sufficient capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>New Jersey Bd. of Pub. Util. </i>v. <i>FERC</i>, 744 F.\xc2\xa03d 74, 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (CA3 2014) (upholding FERC\xe2\x80\x99s elimination of the state-supported generation exemption).  In the first year CPV bid capacity from its new plant into the PJM capacity auction, that capacity cleared the auction at the MOPR rate, so CPV was thereafter eligible to function as a price taker.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to seeking the elimination of the state-supported generation exemption, incumbent generators\xe2\x80\x94respondents here\xe2\x80\x94brought suit in the District of Maryland against members of the Maryland Public Service Commission in their official capacities.  The incumbent generators sought a declaratory judgment that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program violates the Supremacy Clause by setting a wholesale rate for electricity and by interfering with FERC\xe2\x80\x99s capacity-auction policies.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  CPV intervened as a defendant.  After a six-day bench trial, the District Court issued a declaratory judgment holding that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program improperly sets the rate CPV receives for interstate wholesale capacity sales to PJM.  <i>PPL Energyplus, LLC </i>v. <i>Nazarian</i>, 974 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 790, 840 (Md. 2013).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhile Maryland may retain traditional state authority to regulate the development, location, and type of power plants within its borders,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s power is necessarily limited by FERC\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive authority to set wholesale energy and capacity prices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 829.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fourth Circuit affirmed.

Exercising this authority, FERC has approved the PJM capacity auction as the sole ratesetting mechanism for sales of capacity to PJM, and has deemed the clearing price <i>per\xc2\xa0se </i>just and reasonable.  Doubting FERC\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, Maryland\xe2\x80\x94through the contract for differences\xe2\x80\x94requires CPV to participate in the PJM capacity auction, but guarantees CPV a rate distinct from the clearing price for its interstate sales of capacity to PJM.  By adjusting an interstate wholesale rate, Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program invades FERC\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory turf.

See<i> ibid.</i> (distinguishing between \xe2\x80\x9cmeasures <i>aimed directly</i> at interstate purchasers and wholesalers for resale, and those aimed at subjects left to the States to regulate\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem we have identified with Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program mirrors the problems we identified in <i>Mississippi Power &amp; Light</i> and <i>Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co.</i> v. <i>Thornburg</i>,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 953 (1986)\n.  In each of those cases, a State determined that FERC had failed to ensure the reasonableness of a wholesale rate, and the State therefore prevented a utility from recovering\xe2\x80\x94through retail rates\xe2\x80\x94the full cost of wholesale purchases.  See<i> Mississippi Power &amp; Light</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 360\xe2\x80\x93364; <i>Nantahala</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 956\xe2\x80\x93962.  This Court invalidated the States\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to second-guess the reasonableness of interstate wholesale rates.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Once FERC sets such a rate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we observed in <i>Mississippi Power &amp; Light</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a State may not conclude in setting retail rates that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.  A State must rather give effect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to give FERC plenary authority over interstate wholesale rates, and to ensure that the States do not interfere with this authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373 (quoting <i>Nantahala</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 966).  True, Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program does not prevent a utility from recovering through retail sales a cost FERC mandated it incur\xe2\x80\x94Maryland instead guarantees CPV a certain rate for capacity sales to PJM regardless of the clearing price.  But <i>Mississippi Power &amp; Light </i>and <i>Nantahala</i> make clear that States interfere with FERC\xe2\x80\x99s authority by disregarding interstate wholesale rates FERC has deemed just and reasonable, even when States exercise their traditional authority over retail rates or, as here, in-state generation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The contract for differences, Maryland and CPV respond, is indistinguishable from traditional bilateral contracts for capacity, which FERC has long accommodated in the auction.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and n. 3.  But the contract at issue here differs from traditional bilateral contracts in this significant respect: The contract for differences does not transfer ownership of capacity from one party to another outside the auction.  Instead, the contract for differences operates within the auction; it mandates that LSEs and CPV exchange money based on the cost of CPV\xe2\x80\x99s capacity sales to PJM.  Notably, because the contract for differences does not contemplate the sale of capacity outside the auction, Maryland and CPV took the position, until the Fourth Circuit issued its decision, that the rate in the contract for differences is not subject to FERC\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness review.  See \xc2\xa7824(b)(1) (FERC has jurisdiction over contracts for \xe2\x80\x9c<i>the sale of electric energy</i> at wholesale in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our holding is limited: We reject Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program only because it disregards an interstate wholesale rate required by FERC.  We therefore need not and do not address the permissibility of various other measures States might employ to encourage development of new or clean generation, including tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of state-owned generation facilities, or re-regulation of the energy sector.  Nothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose Maryland and other States from encouraging production of new or clean generation through measures \xe2\x80\x9cuntethered to a generator\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale market participation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 40.

The LSE bids the 50 units of capacity it already owns into the PJM auction, and PJM pays the LSE $2,500 for those 50 units.  Although the LSE then must pay PJM $5,000 for the 100 units it must purchase to satisfy projected demand, the net cost to the LSE of auction participation is only $2,500.

First, consider a hypothetical situation where the clearing price falls below the price guaranteed in the contract for differences.  Assume that CPV\xe2\x80\x99s plant produces 10,000 units of electricity a year, and that the 20-year price guaranteed under the contract is $30/unit.  Assume further that, in a given year during the duration of the price guarantee, the clearing price is $20/unit, and CPV\xe2\x80\x99s capacity clears the auction.  CPV receives payments from Maryland LSEs of $10/unit, or $100,000, and payments from PJM of $20/unit, or $200,000.  The rate CPV receives from the capacity auction is therefore $30/unit\xe2\x80\x94the contract price\xe2\x80\x94not $20/unit\xe2\x80\x94the clearing price.  Under PJM auction rules, Maryland LSEs then must purchase from PJM, at the clearing price of $20/unit, enough capacity to satisfy their assigned shares of anticipated demand.  Assume that PJM requires Maryland LSEs to purchase 40,000 units of capacity.  Total capacity-auction expenses for Maryland LSEs would therefore include both the payment to CPV ($100,000) and the full cost of purchasing capacity from PJM ($800,000), or $900,000.  Absent Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program, the LSEs\xe2\x80\x99 capacity-auction expenses would have included only the total cost of capacity purchases from PJM, or $800,000.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Because neither CPV nor Maryland has challenged whether plaintiffs may seek declaratory relief under the Supremacy Clause, the Court assumes without deciding that they may.

Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program therefore intrudes on the exclusive federal jurisdiction over wholesale electricity rates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the Court applies the FPA\xe2\x80\x99s framework in reaching that conclusion, see <i>ante,</i> at 12, it also relies on principles of implied pre-emption, see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Because we can resolve these cases based on the statute alone, I would affirm based solely on the FPA.  Accord-ingly, I concur in the judgment and I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to the extent that it holds that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s program invades FERC\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3560257">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">Nos. 14\xe2\x80\x93614 and 14\xe2\x80\x93623</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-VideFirstLine">W.

The Federal Power Act authorizes the States to regulate energy production.\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7824(b).  It then instructs the Federal Government to step in and regulate wholesale purchases and energy transportation.  \xc2\xa7824(a).  Finally,it allows the States to assume control over the ultimate sale of energy to consumers.  \xc2\xa7824(b).  In short, theFederal Power Act, like all collaborative federalism stat-utes, envisions a federal-state relationship marked by interdependence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Pre-emption inquiries related to such collaborative programs are particularly delicate.  This Court has said that where \xe2\x80\x9ccoordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal pre-emption becomes a less persuasive one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>New York State Dept. of Social Servs. </i>v. <i>Dublino</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405,\n421 (1973)\n.  That is not to say that pre-emption has no role in such programs, but courts must be careful not to confuse the \xe2\x80\x9ccongressionally designed interplay between state and federal regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. </i>v.<i> State Corporation, Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Kan.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 493,\n518 (1989)\n, for impermissible tension that requires pre-emption under the Supremacy Clause.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this context, therefore, our general exhortation not to rely on a talismanic pre-emption vocabulary applies with special force.  See<i> Hines </i>v.<i> Davidowitz</i>,\n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52,\n67 (1941)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court . . . has made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference.  But none of these expressions provides an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I understand today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to reflect these principles.  Using the purpose of the Federal Power Act as the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate touchstone\xe2\x80\x9d of its pre-emption inquiry, <i>Altria Group, Inc. </i>v. <i>Good</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70,\n76 (2008)\n, rather than resting on generic pre-emption frameworks unrelated to the Federal Power Act, the Court holds that Maryland has impermissibly impeded the performance of one of FERC\xe2\x80\x99s core regulatory duties.  Ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d wholesale rates is a central purpose of the Act.  See<i> </i>16 \xc2\xa7824d(a).  Pursuant to its mandate to set such rates, FERC has approved the PJM Interconnection capacity auction as the proper mechanism to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d rate for the sale of petitioner CPV Maryland, LLC\xe2\x80\x99s energy at wholesale.  <i>Ante</i>, at 12.  Maryland, however, has acted to guarantee CPV a rate different from FERC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d rate and has thus contravened the goals of the Federal Power Act.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Such actions must be preempted. <i>Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. </i>v.<i> Mississippi ex rel. Moore</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 354,\n374 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cStates may not regulate in areas where FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court, however, also rightly recognizes the importance of protecting the States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to contribute, within their regulatory domain, to the Federal Power Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of ensuring a sustainable supply of efficient and price-effective energy.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Endorsing those conclusions, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</b></div>'
