JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question to be decided in this case is whether federal labor policy preempts the authority of a state labor relations board to grant an employer covered by the National Labor Relations Act an order enjoining a union and its members from continuing to refuse to work overtime pursuant to a union policy to put economic pressure on the employer in negotiations for renewal of an expired collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>A collective bargaining agreement between petitioner Lodge 76 (Union) and respondent Kearney &amp; Trecker </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 427 U. S. 134</a></p><p> Corp. (employer) was terminated by the employer pursuant to the terms of the agreement on June 19, 1971.  Good faith bargaining over the terms of a renewal agreement continued for over a year thereafter, finally resulting in the signing of a new agreement effective July 23, 1972.  A particularly controverted issue during negotiations was the employer\'s demand that the provision of the expired agreement under which, as for the prior 17 years, the basic workday was seven and one-half hours, Monday through Friday, and the basic workweek was 37 1/2 hours, be replaced with a new provision providing a basic workday of eight hours and a basic workweek of 40 hours, and that the terms on which overtime rates of pay were payable be changed accordingly.</p>\n<p>A few days after the old agreement was terminated the employer unilaterally began to make changes in some conditions of employment provided in the expired contract, <em>e.g.,</em> eliminating the checkoff of Union dues, eliminating the Union\'s office in the plant, and eliminating Union lost time.  No immediate change was made in the basic workweek or workday, but in March, 1972, the employer announced that it would unilaterally implement, as of March 13, 1972, its proposal for a 40-hour week and eight-hour day.  The Union response was a membership meeting on March 7 at which strike action was authorized and a resolution was adopted binding Union members to refuse to work any overtime, defined as work in excess of seven and one-half hours in any day or 37 1/2 hours in any week.  Following the strike vote, the employer offered to "defer the implementation" of its workweek proposal if the Union would agree to call off the concerted refusal to work overtime.  The Union, however, refused the offer and indicated its intent to continue the concerted ban on overtime.  Thereafter, the employer did not make effective the proposed changes in the workday and workweek </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 427 U. S. 135</a></p><p> before the new agreement became effective on July 23, 1972.  Although all but a very few employees complied with the Union\'s resolution against acceptance of overtime work during the negotiations, the employer did not discipline, or attempt to discipline, any employee for refusing to work overtime.</p>\n<p>Instead, while negotiations continued, the employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the Union\'s resolution violated \xc2\xa7 8(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b)(3).  The Regional Director dismissed the charge on the ground that the "policy prohibiting overtime work by its member employees . . . does not appear to be in violation of the Act," and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the Board under <em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/477/case.html">361 U. S. 477</a></span> (1960).  However, the employer also filed a complaint before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission charging that the refusal to work overtime constituted an unfair labor practice under state law.  The Union filed a motion before the Commission to dismiss the complaint for want of "jurisdiction over the subject matter" in that jurisdiction over "the activity of the [Union] complained of [is] preempted by" the National Labor Relations Act.  App. 11.  The motion was denied and the Commission adopted the Conclusion of Law of its Examiner that</p>\n<p>"the concerted refusal to work overtime, is not an activity which is arguably protected under Section 7 or arguably prohibited under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and . . therefore, the . . . Commission is not preempted from asserting its jurisdiction to regulate said conduct."</p>\n<p>The Commission also adopted the further Conclusion of Law that the Union</p>\n<p>"by authorizing . . . the concerted refusal to work overtime . . . engaged in a concerted effort to interfere with production and . . . committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 427 U. S. 136</a></p><p> of Section 111.06(2)(h). . . . [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Commission thereupon entered an order that the Union, <em>inter alia,</em> "[i]mmediately cease and desist from authorizing, encouraging or condoning any concerted refusal to accept overtime assignments. . . ."  The Wisconsin Circuit Court affirmed and entered judgment enforcing the Commission\'s order.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court. 67 Wis.2d 13, 226 N.W.2d 203 (1975).  We granted certiorari, 423 U.S. 890 (1975).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>"The national . . .Act . . . leaves much to the states, though Congress has refrained from telling us how much.

Federal labor policy as reflected in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, has been construed not to preclude the States from regulating aspects of labor relations that involve</p>\n<p>"conduct touch[ing] interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that . . we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act."</p>\n<p><em>San Diego Unions v.

Jacksonville Terminal Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/369/case.html">394 U.

Each of these distinct aspects of labor law preemption has had its own history in our decisions, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p>We consider first preemption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board.  This line of preemption analysis was developed in <em>San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra,</em> and its history was recently summarized in <em>Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/274/case.html">403 U.

S. 290</a></span>-291 (1971):</p>\n<p>"[V]arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling with this preemption problem.  Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 427 U. S. 139</a></p><p> labor relations, which were preempted.  <em>See, e.g., Automobile Workers v. Russell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/356/634/case.html">356 U. S. 634</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/356/634/case.html#645">356 U. S. 645</a></span> (1958).  Others made preemption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, <em>e.g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/348/468/case.html">348 U. S. 468</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/348/468/case.html#479">348 U. S. 479</a></span>-480 (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, <em>e.g., Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/336/245/case.html">336 U. S. 245</a></span> (1949). . . .  [N]one of these approaches proved satisfactory, however, and each was ultimately abandoned.  It was, in short, experience -- not pure logic -- which initially taught that each of these methods sacrificed important federal interests in a uniform law of labor relations centrally administered by an expert agency without yielding anything in return by way of predictability or ease of judicial application."</p>\n<p>"The failure of alternative analyses and the interplay of the foregoing policy considerations, then, led this Court to hold in <em>Garmon,</em> 359 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/359/236/case.html#244">359 U. S. 244</a></span>:"</p>\n<p>"   When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \xc2\xa7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under \xc2\xa7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.  To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law."</p>\n<p><em>See also San Diego Unions v.

S. 140</a></p><p></p>\n<p>However, a second line of preemption analysis has been developed in cases focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left "to be controlled by the free play of economic forces."  <em>NLRB v Nash-Finch Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/138/case.html">404 U. S. 138</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/138/case.html#144">404 U. S. 144</a></span> (1971). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Concededly this inquiry was not made in 1949 in the so-called <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> case, <em>Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/245/case.html">336 U. S. 245</a></span> (1949), the decision of this Court heavily relied upon by the court below in reaching its decision that state regulation of the conduct at issue is not preempted by national labor law.  In <em>Briggs-Stratton,</em> the union, in order to bring pressure on the employer during negotiations, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 427 U. S. 141</a></p><p> adopted a plan whereby union meetings were called at irregular times during working hours without advance notice to the employer or any notice as to whether or when the workers would return.  In a proceeding under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board issued an order forbidding the union and its members to engage in concerted efforts to interfere with production by those methods.  This Court did not inquire whether Congress meant that such methods should be reserved to the union "to be controlled by the free play of economic forces."  Rather, because these methods were "neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it," the Court held that there "was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate" such conduct.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/245/case.html#265">336 U. S. 265</a></span>.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> holding that state power is not preempted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by \xc2\xa7 7 nor prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8 of the federal Act, a holding premised on the statement that "[t]his conduct is governable by the State or it is entirely ungoverned," 336 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/245/case.html#254">336 U. S. 254</a></span>, was undercut by subsequent decisions of this Court.  For the Court soon recognized that a particular activity might be "protected" by federal law not only when it fell within \xc2\xa7 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be "unrestricted by <em>any</em> governmental power to regulate" because it was among the permissible</p>\n<p>"economic weapons in reserve, . . . actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized."</p>\n<p><em>NLRB v.

The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good faith bargaining over the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.  During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer\'s business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union\'s bargaining demands.  The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company\'s reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in "sit-in-mornings," "doing what comes naturally," and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders\' signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders\' petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there.  361 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/477/case.html#480">361 U.

Thus, the Board, in the guise of determining good or bad faith in negotiations, could regulate what economic weapons a party might summon to its aid.  And if the Board could regulate the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining, it would be in a position to exercise considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract.  As the parties\' own devices became more limited, the Government might have to enter even more directly into the negotiation of collective agreements.  Our labor policy is not presently erected on a foundation of government control of the results of negotiations.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.

Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.

Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in <em>H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB,</em> 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/99/case.html#109">397 U.

It is not contended, and on the record could not be contended, that the Union policy against overtime work was enforced by violence or threats of intimidation or injury to property.  Workers simply left the plant at the end of their workshift and refused to volunteer for or accept overtime or Saturday work.  In sustaining the order of the Wisconsin Commission, the Wisconsin Supreme Court relied on <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> as dispositive against the Union\'s claim of preemption, 67 Wis.2d at 19, 226 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 427 U. S. 155</a></p><p> N.W.2d at 206.  The court held further that the refusal to work overtime was neither arguably protected under \xc2\xa7 7 nor arguably prohibited under \xc2\xa7 8 of the federal Act, <em>id.</em> at 23-24, 226 N.W.2d at 208, an analysis which, as developed, is largely inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.  <em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents</em> was distinguished on the ground that that case dealt only with NLRB power "to regulate . . . strike tactics," and left such "regulation . . . to the states."  67 Wis.2d at 22, 226 N.W.2d at 207.  Finally, the court rejected the Union\'s argument, relying on <em>Teamsters Union v. Morton,</em> that the refusal to work overtime was affirmatively "permitted" under federal law, stating:  "Congress has not <em>focused upon\' partial . . . strikes," and therefore "[p]olicing of such conduct is left wholly to the states."  67 Wis.2d at 26, 226 N.W.2d at 209.\n</em></p>\n<p>Since <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union\'s refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Wisconsin Stat. \xc2\xa7 111.06(2) (1974) provides:</p>\n<p>"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employe individually or in concert with others:"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(h) To take unauthorized possession of property of the employer or to engage in any concerted effort to interfere with production except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, <em>Automobile Workers v.

And as I understand the Court\'s holding today, it assumes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 427 U. S. 157</a></p><p> that this activity remains unprotected. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by \xc2\xa7 8 of the Act, the Court\'s conclusion would also be supported by <em>Garmon.</em>  But ever since <em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/477/case.html">361 U.

Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/252/case.html">377 U. S. 252</a></span>.  But this is not such a case.  Despite the numerous statements in the Court\'s opinion about Congress\' intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.

But none of the cases reviewed in the Court\'s opinion so holds. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Ever since 1949, when <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States.</p>\n<p>If adherence to the rule of Briggs-Stratton would permit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 427 U.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Stability and predictability in the law are enhanced when the Court resists the temptation to overrule its prior decisions. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It is particularly inappropriate to do so when the Court is purporting to implement the intent of Congress with respect to an issue that Congress has yet to address.  <em>Edelman v.

Finally, I am not nearly as sanguine as the Court about the likelihood that this decision will clarify or harmonize a fairly confused area of the law.  In sum, I would adhere to prior precedent which is directly in point.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I recognize that there is some ambiguity in the Court\'s discussion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#152">427 U.

The ambiguity of the Court\'s rationale is inconsistent with its assumption that the employer is wholly free to use economic self-help without fear of committing an unfair labor practice.  In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court\'s opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in <em>Briggs-Stratton,</em> is unprotected by \xc2\xa7 7.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>A scholar who has criticized <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> has observed:</p>\n<p>"The omission of a federal prohibition against \'quickie\' strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously rejected such tactics."</p>\n<p>Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv.

Congress\' failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s quotation, <em>ibid.,</em> from <em>Hanna Mining, Co. v. Marine Engineers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/181/case.html">382 U. S. 181</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/181/case.html#187">382 U. S. 187</a></span>, when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in <em>San Diego Unions v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span>, which poses, but does not answer, the question whether preemption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <l=|427 132fn2="" 2|="" u.s.="">n. 2, <em>supra.</em></l=|427></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with the Court\'s conclusion that the holding in <em>Briggs-Stratton,</em> overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#151">427 U.

The decision in <em>Insurance Agents, supra,</em> is readily distinguishable.  <em>See</em> <l=|427 132fn2="" 3|="" u.s.="">n. 3, <em>supra.</em>  It is true that <em>Briggs-Stratton</em> has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by \xc2\xa7 7 or prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  <em>Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/274/case.html">403 U. S. 274</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/274/case.html#291">403 U. S. 291</a></span>; <em>San Diego Unions v.

But the rule established in <em>Garmon,</em> and reaffirmed in <em>Lockridge,</em> is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.</l=|427></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
