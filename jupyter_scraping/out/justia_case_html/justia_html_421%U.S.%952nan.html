Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#113">413 U.S. 49, 113</a> (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, the definition of \'obscene\' as contained in 26-2101, is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a>d 419 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia was rendered after Miller, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html">413 U.S. 483</a>, 494, 495 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). </p><p> Finally, it does not appear that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards.
