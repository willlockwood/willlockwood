That on 16 April, 1841, Hughes presented the said certificate to the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington, still falsely representing the land as subject to private entry and sale and that he had legally paid for the same, and did procure the commissioner to issue a patent to him.  That all the acts and doings of the register </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 52 U.

Whether, at the time of his procuring said patent from Washington, he, the said David Michael Hughes, did not have information or did not have reason to believe that the said land had formerly been entered and paid for by John Goodbee.</p>\n<p>9th.  Whether the said John Goodbee is now alive, and, if not, when did he die.</p>\n<p>10th.

In whose possession is said land now, and by what title do the present possessors hold it.  Is said title derived from John Goodbee, and how.</p>\n<p>The prayer of the bill was for an injunction to restrain Hughes from proceeding at law upon the patent to obtain possession of the land, and to restrain him from selling, disposing of, or parting with the same during the pendency of this suit, and that he may be decreed to deliver up the patent to the United States to be cancelled as having been issued to him in error and without right, and for further and general relief.</p>\n<p>Sewall and Hudson, the latter by his tutor, answered the bill, setting forth their title derived from Goodbee, praying to be dismissed from court and quieted in their title.</p>\n<p>Hughes demurred, and for special causes of demurrer assigned:</p>\n<p>1st.  That by the showing in said bill this Court has no jurisdiction of the matter presented, as the subject of controversy between this defendant and Sewall and Hudson, being all citizens of Louisiana.</p>\n<p>2d.  Because, by the showing in said bill, the United States, as complainants, have no interest whatever in the matter in controversy.</p>\n<p>3d.  That the case made by the bill shows that Robert Sewall </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 52 U. S. 557</a></p><p> and Franklin Hudson, who are defendants in this bill, are in point of interest the only proper parties to complain against this defendant, and are not properly his co-defendants.</p>\n<p>4th.  Because, by the case made by the bill, the United States appears to litigate the private rights of one citizen against another citizen without cause or authority so to do.</p>\n<p>5th.  Because there is no law to authorize the United States to invoke the courts of the United States to repeal, revoke, and cancel a deed for land given by the United States to a citizen when the whole price is acknowledged to have been received by the United States for the land sold.</p>\n<p>6th.  Because the complaint is in form an information by the district attorney of the United States in behalf of the United States and in behalf of Sewall and Hudson for matters only cognizable by a court of equity on a bill in chancery at the instance of the party aggrieved.</p>\n<p>7th.  Because the matter asserted as a preemption right to land in John Goodbee is in law no right of preemption.</p>\n<p>8th.  Because if the right asserted was originally good as a right of preemption in Goodbee, it is shown by the bill to have been lost and forfeited as such right for want of timely payment and for many other defects &amp;c. in said bill appearing.</p>\n<p>On the 24th of January, 1849, the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill.

JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Attorney of the United States for the District of Louisiana, on behalf of the United States, filed an information in the nature of a bill in chancery against David M. Hughes, having for its object the repeal and surrender of a patent for 175 46/100 acres of land, made to Hughes by the President of the United States, April 16, 1841.  The bill proceeds on the ground that said patent was fraudulently obtained, being in violation of the rights of Sewall and Hudson, deriving title from John Goodbee, who entered the land as his preemption claim under the Act of April 12, 1814, paid the purchase money, and got a certificate of purchase, in 1822, for 160 acres, but when the public surveys were executed, the legal subdivision was found to contain 15 46/100 acres more, to which Goodbee\'s right of preemption also extended.</p>\n<p>The validity of Goodbee\'s entries depends on the regulations of the land office, made in pursuance of statutes enacted by Congress, and which statutes and regulations are accurately set forth by the Attorney General in his argument in this cause, and need not be further stated here.</p>\n<p>It appears that in 1836 Hughes entered the same land with full knowledge that those holding possession under Goodbee\'s title were owners and cultivating a sugar plantation on it.  The existence of Goodbee\'s preemption right and better title was overlooked at the land office in Louisiana, where the entry of Hughes was made, and again at the General Land Office until after his patent had issued.</p>\n<p>As the bill was demurred to, no dispute can be raised on the question of fraud, nor can any doubt exist that this second purchase was fraudulently obtained, Sewall and Hudson being notoriously in possession of the land as owners when Hughes made his entry at the land office.</p>\n<p>1st.  The first and main objection made for defendant Hughes is that this proceeding is improper, and will not lie. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 52 U. S. 568</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is to be regretted that this was not a simple bill in equity brought by the United States against the defendant Hughes, praying that the patent might be annulled and surrendered by a decree in chancery, without any attempt of assimilating the proceeding to an information brought by the Attorney General on behalf of the Crown in England to repeal a patent.  In this country, the lands of the United States lying within the states are held and subject to be sold under the authority of Congress, as lands may be held and sold by individual owners or by ordinary corporations, and similar remedies may be employed by the United States as owners that are applicable in cases of others.  This, we think, is manifest.  It was so held in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/773/case.html">King v. United States,</a></span></em> 3 How. 773.</p>\n<p>In substance, this is a bill in equity for and on behalf of the United States because of an injury done to the United States by Hughes, the defendant, and we will not dismiss it for want of form.</p>\n<p>By the Constitution, Congress is vested with power to dispose of the public lands and to make all needful rules and regulations respecting them.  Under existing regulations, Goodbee had a right to enter the land in dispute in exclusion of others and did so, and the United States, as owner, having been paid for the land, was bound to make the purchaser a title in the same manner that an individual would have been bound under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p>As the patent to Hughes is a conveyance of the fee, the United States stand divested of the legal title, and therefore cannot fulfill their engagement with Goodbee and his alienees, to whom they stand bound for a legal title until the grant to Hughes is annulled.</p>\n<p>It is manifest that if the agents of an individual had been thus imposed on, the conveyance could be set aside because of mistake on part of such agents and fraud on part of the second purchaser in order that the first contract could be complied with.  Nor can it be conceived why the government should stand on a different footing from any other proprietor.</p>\n<p>Hughes has no right to complain, for so soon as it was discovered that he had defrauded the government and those claiming under it, his purchase money was tendered and a surrender of the patent demanded, but he refused to receive the money or surrender his legal advantage.</p>\n<p>2d.  The demurrer having been sustained, and the bill dismissed by the circuit court, it is insisted here that no appeal would lie, because the matter in dispute does not appear to have amounted to $2,000.  All the assignments from Goodbee down to the present owners Sewall and Hudson are exhibited </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 52 U. S. 569</a></p><p> with the bill as a part thereof, the first of which is a notarial conveyance from Goodbee to Bush dated in 1822.  It states that the consideration of $2,000 had been paid for the land, and, there being a sugar plantation on it, we assume its value to be quite equal now.  As we are bound by complainant\'s allegation of value, no controversy can be raised on the fact.  If, however, any objection existed, value could be proved here in like manner as is usually done in cases of ejectment, where there is no allegation what the property in dispute is worth.</p>\n<p><em>We are of opinion that the patent to Hughes should be vacated and annulled, and accordingly order that the decree of the Circuit Court of the District of Louisiana be reversed; and it is adjudged and decreed, that the patent made to David Michael Hughes by the President of the United States, on 16 April, A.D. 1841, for 175 46/100 acres of land, being for section 54 in township 10 of range 12 east, in the district of lands subject to sale at New Orleans, Louisiana, be, and the same is hereby, vacated, and declared null and void.
