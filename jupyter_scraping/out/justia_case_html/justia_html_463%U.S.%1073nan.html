The respondent class consists of all female employees who are enrolled in the plan or will enroll in the plan in the future.

Manhart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html">435 U. S. 702</a></span> (1978), this Court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an employer from requiring women to make larger contributions in order to obtain the same monthly pension benefits as men.  The question presented by this case is whether Title VII also prohibits an employer from offering its employees the option of receiving retirement benefits from one of several companies selected by the employer, all of which pay a woman lower monthly benefits than a man who has made the same contributions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Since 1974, the State of Arizona has offered its employees the opportunity to enroll in a deferred compensation plan administered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1076">Page 463 U. S. 1076</a></p><p> by the Arizona Governing Committee for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans (Governing Committee).  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 38-871 <em>et seq.</em> (1974 and Supp.1982-1983); Ariz. Regs. 2-9-01 <em>et seq.</em> (1975).  Employees who participate in the plan may thereby postpone the receipt of a portion of their wages until retirement.  By doing so, they postpone paying federal income tax on the amounts deferred until after retirement, when they receive those amounts and any earnings thereon. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>After inviting private companies to submit bids outlining the investment opportunities that they were willing to offer state employees, the State selected several companies to participate in its deferred compensation plan.  Many of the companies selected offer three basic retirement options:  (1) a single lump-sum payment upon retirement, (2) periodic payments of a fixed sum for a fixed period of time, and (3) monthly annuity payments for the remainder of the employee\'s life.  When an employee decides to take part in the deferred compensation plan, he must designate the company in which he wishes to invest his deferred wages.  Employees must choose one of the companies selected by the State to participate in the plan; they are not free to invest their deferred compensation in any other way.  At the time an employee enrolls in the plan, he may also select one of the pay-out options offered by the company that he has chosen, but when he reaches retirement age, he is free to switch to one of the company\'s other options.  If at retirement the employee decides to receive a lump-sum payment, he may also purchase any of the options then being offered by the other companies participating in the plan.  Many employees find an annuity contract to be the most attractive option, since receipt of a lump sum upon retirement requires payment of taxes on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1077">Page 463 U. S. 1077</a></p><p> the entire sum in one year, and the choice of a fixed sum for a fixed period requires an employee to speculate as to how long he will live.</p>\n<p>Once an employee chooses the company in which he wishes to invest and decides the amount of compensation to be deferred each month, the State is responsible for withholding the appropriate sums from the employee\'s wages and channeling those sums to the company designated by the employee.  The State bears the cost of making the necessary payroll deductions and of giving employees time off to attend group meetings to learn about the plan, but it does not contribute any moneys to supplement the employees\' deferred wages.</p>\n<p>For an employee who elects to receive a monthly annuity following retirement, the amount of the employee\'s monthly benefits depends upon the amount of compensation that the employee deferred (and any earnings thereon), the employee\'s age at retirement, and the employee\'s sex.  All of the companies selected by the State to participate in the plan use sex-based mortality tables to calculate monthly retirement benefits.  App. 12.  Under these tables, a man receives larger monthly payments than a woman who deferred the same amount of compensation and retired at the same age, because the tables classify annuitants on the basis of sex, and women, on average, live longer than men. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Sex is the only factor that the tables use to classify individuals of the same age; the tables do not incorporate other factors correlating with longevity such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption, weight, medical history, or family history.  <em>Id.</em> at 13. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1078">Page 463 U. S. 1078</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As of August 18, 1978, 1,675 of the State\'s approximately 35,000 employees were participating in the deferred compensation plan.  Of these 1,675 participating employees, 681 were women, and 572 women had elected some form of future annuity option.  As of the same date, 10 women participating in the plan had retired, and 4 of those 10 had chosen a lifetime annuity.  <em>Id.</em> at 6.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>On May 3, 1975, respondent Nathalie Norris, an employee in the Arizona Department of Economic Security, elected to participate in the plan.  She requested that her deferred compensation be invested in the Lincoln National Life Insurance Co.\'s fixed annuity contract.  Shortly thereafter, Arizona approved respondent\'s request and began withholding $199.50 from her salary each month.</p>\n<p>On April 25, 1978, after exhausting administrative remedies, respondent brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the State, the Governing Committee, and several individual members of the Committee.  Respondent alleged that the defendants were violating \xc2\xa7 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a), by administering an annuity plan that discriminates on the basis of sex.  Respondent requested that the District Court certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) consisting of all female employees of the State of Arizona "who are enrolled or will in the future enroll in the State Deferred Compensation Plan."  Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd V.</p>\n<p>On March 12, 1980, the District Court certified a class action and granted summary judgment for the plaintiff class, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] holding that the State\'s plan violates Title VII. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  486 F.Supp </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1079">Page 463 U. S. 1079</a></p><p> 645.  The court directed petitioners to cease using sex-based actuarial tables and to pay retired female employees benefits equal to those paid to similarly situated men. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, with one judge dissenting.  671 F.2d 330 (1982).  We granted certiorari to decide whether the Arizona plan violates Title VII and whether, if so, the relief ordered by the District Court was proper.  459 U.S. 904 (1982).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We consider first whether petitioners would have violated Title VII if they had run the entire deferred compensation plan themselves, without the participation of any insurance companies.  Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice</p>\n<p>"to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\'s race, color, religion, sex or national origin."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a)(1).  There is no question that the opportunity to participate in a deferred compensation plan constitutes a "conditio[n] or privileg[e] of employment," [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and that retirement benefits constitute a form of "compensation." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The issue we must decide is whether it is discrimination "because of . . . sex" to pay a retired woman lower monthly benefits than a man who deferred the same amount of compensation. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1080">Page 463 U.

We concluded that a plan requiring women to make greater contributions than men discriminates "because of . . . sex" for the simple reason that it treats each woman "<em>in a manner which, but for [her] sex, would [have been] different.\'"  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#711">435 U. S. 711</a></span>, quoting Developments in the Law, Employment Discrimination and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 84 Harv.L.Rev. 1109, 1170 (1971).\n</em></p>\n<p>We have no hesitation in holding, as have all but one of the lower courts that have considered the question, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] that the classification of employees on the basis of sex is no more permissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than at the pay-in stage. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We reject petitioners\' contention that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1082">Page 463 U. S. 1082</a></p><p> Arizona plan does not discriminate on the basis of sex because a woman and a man who defer the same amount of compensation will obtain upon retirement annuity policies having approximately the same present actuarial value. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Arizona has simply offered its employees a choice among different levels of annuity benefits, any one of which, if offered alone, would be equivalent to the plan at issue in <em>Manhart,</em> where the employer determined both the monthly contributions employees were required to make and the level of benefits that they were paid.  If a woman participating in the Arizona plan wishes to obtain monthly benefits equal to those obtained by a man, she must make greater monthly contributions than he, just as the female employees in <em>Manhart</em> had to make greater contributions to obtain equal benefits.  For any particular level of benefits that a woman might wish to receive, she will have to make greater monthly contributions to obtain that level of benefits than a man would have to make.  The fact that Arizona has offered a range of discriminatory benefit levels, rather than only one such level, obviously provides no basis whatsoever for distinguishing <em>Manhart.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1083">Page 463 U. S. 1083</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In asserting that the Arizona plan is nondiscriminatory because a man and a woman who have made equal contributions will obtain annuity policies of roughly equal present actuarial value, petitioners incorrectly assume that Title VII permits an employer to classify employees on the basis of sex in predicting their longevity.  Otherwise, there would be no basis for postulating that a woman\'s annuity policy has the same present actuarial value as the policy of a similarly situated man even though her policy provides lower monthly benefits. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  This underlying assumption -- that sex may properly be used to predict longevity -- is flatly inconsistent with the basic teaching of <em>Manhart:</em>  that Title VII requires employers to treat their employees as <em>individuals,</em> not "as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual, or national class."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#708">435 U. S. 708</a></span>.  <em>Manhart</em> squarely rejected the notion that, because women, as a class, live longer than men, an employer may adopt a retirement plan that treats every individual woman less favorably than every individual man.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#716">435 U. S. 716</a></span>-717.</p>\n<p>As we observed in <em>Manhart,</em> "[a]ctuarial studies could unquestionably identify differences in life expectancy based on race or national origin, as well as sex."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#709">435 U. S. 709</a></span> (footnote omitted).  If petitioners\' interpretation of the statute were correct, such studies could be used as a justification for paying employees of one race lower monthly benefits than employees of another race.  We continue to believe that "a statute that was designed to make race irrelevant in the employment market," <em>ibid.,</em> citing <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/case.html">401 U.

S. 436</a></span> (1971), could not reasonably be construed to permit such a racial classification.  And if it would be unlawful to use race-based actuarial tables, it must also be unlawful to use sex-based tables, for under Title VII, a distinction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1084">Page 463 U. S. 1084</a></p><p> based on sex stands on the same footing as a distinction based on race unless it falls within one of a few narrow exceptions that are plainly inapplicable here. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>What we said in <em>Manhart</em> bears repeating:  "Congress has decided that classifications based on sex, like those based on national origin or race, are unlawful."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#709">435 U. S. 709</a></span>.  The use of sex-segregated actuarial tables to calculate retirement benefits violates Title VII whether or not the tables reflect an accurate prediction of the longevity of women as a class, for under the statute, "[e]ven a true generalization about [a] class" cannot justify class-based treatment.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  <em>Manhart,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#718">435 U. S. 718</a></span>, n. 33.  Recognizing this limitation on the reach of the statute, we noted in <em>Manhart</em> that</p>\n<p>"[n]othing in our holding implies that it would be unlawful for an employer to set aside equal retirement contributions for each employee and let each retiree purchase the largest benefit which his or her accumulated contributions could command in the open market."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#717">435 U.

S. 1087</a></p><p> Relying on this caveat, petitioners contend that they have not violated Title VII, because the life annuities offered by the companies participating in the Arizona plan reflect what is available in the open market.  Petitioners cite a statement in the stipulation of facts entered into in the District Court that "[a]ll tables presently in use provide a larger sum to a male than to a female of equal age, account value and any guaranteed payment period."  App. 10. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1088">Page 463 U. S. 1088</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is no defense that all annuities immediately available in the open market may have been based on sex-segregated actuarial tables.  In context, it is reasonably clear that the stipulation on which petitioners rely means only that all the tables used by the companies taking part in the Arizona plan are based on sex, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] but our conclusion does not depend upon whether petitioners\' construction of the stipulation is accepted or rejected.  It is irrelevant whether any other insurers offered annuities on a sex-neutral basis, since the State did not simply set aside retirement contributions and let employees purchase annuities on the open market.  On the contrary, the State provided the opportunity to obtain an annuity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1089">Page 463 U. S. 1089</a></p><p> as part of its own deferred compensation plan.  It invited insurance companies to submit bids outlining the terms on which they would supply retirement benefits [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] and selected the companies that were permitted to participate in the plan.  Once the State selected these companies, it entered into contracts with them governing the terms on which benefits were to be provided to employees.  Employees enrolling in the plan could obtain retirement benefits only from one of those companies, and no employee could be contacted by a company except as permitted by the State.  Ariz.Regs. 2-9-06.A, 2-9-20.A (1975).</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, there can be no serious question that petitioners are legally responsible for the discriminatory terms on which annuities are offered by the companies chosen to participate in the plan.  Having created a plan whereby employees can obtain the advantages of using deferred compensation to purchase an annuity only if they invest in one of the companies specifically selected by the State, the State cannot disclaim responsibility for the discriminatory features of the insurers\' options. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Since employers are ultimately responsible for the "compensation, terms, conditions, [and] privileges of employment" provided to employees, an employer that adopts a fringe benefit scheme that discriminates among its employees on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin violates Title VII regardless of whether third parties are also involved in the discrimination. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1090">Page 463 U. S. 1090</a></p><p> this case, the State of Arizona was itself a party to contracts concerning the annuities to be offered by the insurance companies, and it is well established that both parties to a discriminatory contract are liable for any discriminatory provisions the contract contains, regardless of which party initially suggested inclusion of the discriminatory provisions.

When a court directs a change in benefits based on contributions made before the court\'s order, the court is awarding relief that is fundamentally retroactive in nature.  This is true because retirement benefits under a plan such as that at issue here represent a return on contributions which were made during the employee\'s working years and which were intended to fund the benefits without any additional contributions from any source after retirement. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1093">Page 463 U.

Absent special circumstances, a victim of a Title VII violation is entitled to whatever retroactive relief is necessary to undo any damage resulting from the violation.  <em>See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#418">422 U.

As to any disparity in benefits that is attributable to contributions made after our decision in <em>Manhart,</em> there are no special circumstances justifying the denial of retroactive relief.  Our ruling today was clearly foreshadowed by <em>Manhart.</em>  That decision should have put petitioners on notice that a man and a woman who make the same contributions to a retirement plan must be paid the same monthly benefits. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  To the extent that any disparity in benefits coming due after the date of the District Court\'s judgment is attributable to contributions made after <em>Manhart,</em> there is therefore no unfairness in requiring petitioners to pay retired female employees whatever sum is necessary each month to bring them up to the benefit level that they would have enjoyed had their post-<em>Manhart</em> contributions been treated in the same way as those of similarly situated male employees.</p>\n<p>To the extent, however, that the disparity in benefits that the District Court required petitioners to eliminate is attributable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1094">Page 463 U. S. 1094</a></p><p> to contributions made before <em>Manhart,</em> the court gave insufficient attention to this Court\'s recognition in <em>Manhart</em> that, until that decision, the use of sex-based tables might reasonably have been assumed to be lawful.  Insofar as this portion of the disparity is concerned, the District Court should have inquired into the circumstances in which petitioners, after <em>Manhart,</em> could have applied sex-neutral tables to the pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions of a female employee and a similarly situated male employee without violating any contractual rights that the latter might have had on the basis of his pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions.  If, in the case of a particular female employee and a similarly situated male employee, petitioners could have applied sex-neutral tables to pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions without violating any contractual right of the male employee, they should have done so in order to prevent further discrimination in the payment of retirement benefits in the wake of this Court\'s ruling in <em>Manhart.</em> [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Since a female employee in this situation should have had sex-neutral tables applied to her pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions, it is only fair that petitioners be required to supplement any benefits coming due after the District Court\'s judgment by whatever sum is necessary to compensate her for their failure to adopt sex-neutral tables.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, sex-neutral tables could not have been applied to the pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions of a particular female employee and any similarly situated male employee without violating the male employee\'s contractual rights, it would be inequitable to award such relief.  To do so would be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1095">Page 463 U. S. 1095</a></p><p> to require petitioners to compensate the female employee for a disparity attributable to pre-<em>Manhart</em> conduct even though such conduct might reasonably have been assumed to be lawful and petitioners could not have done anything after <em>Manhart</em> to eliminate that disparity short of expending state funds.  With respect to any female employee determined to fall in this category, petitioners need only ensure that her monthly benefits are no lower than they would have been had her post-<em>Manhart</em> contributions been treated in the same way as those of a similarly situated male employee.</p>\n<p>The record does not indicate whether some or all of the male participants in the plan who had not retired at the time <em>Manhart</em> was decided [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] had any contractual right to a particular level of benefits that would have been impaired by the application of sex-neutral tables to their pre-<em>Manhart</em> contributions.

The McCarran-Ferguson Act provides that</p>\n<p>"[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1012(b).  Although there are no reported Arizona cases indicating the effect of the Arizona statute cited by JUSTICE POWELL on classifications based on sex in annuity policies, we may assume that the statute would permit such classifications, for that assumption does not affect our conclusion that the application of Title VII in this case does not supersede the application of any state law regulating "the business of insurance."  As the Court of Appeals explained, 671 F.2d 330, 333 (1982), the plaintiff class in this case has not challenged the conduct of the business of insurance.  No insurance company has been joined as a defendant, and our judgment will in no way preclude any insurance company from offering annuity benefits that are calculated on the basis of sex-segregated actuarial tables.  All that is at issue in this case is <em>an employment practice:</em>  the practice of offering a male employee the opportunity to obtain greater monthly annuity benefits than could be obtained by a similarly situated female employee.  It is this conduct of the employer that is prohibited by Title VII.  By its own terms, the McCarran-Ferguson Act applies only to the business of insurance, and has no application to employment practices.  Arizona plainly is not itself involved in the business of insurance, since it has not underwritten any risks.  <em>See Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v.

After <em>Manhart,</em> an employer could not reasonably have assumed that a sex-based plan would be lawful.

This is contrary to our explicit recognition in <em>Los Angeles Dept. of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html">435 U. S. 702</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#717">435 U. S. 717</a></span> (1978), that Title VII "was [not] intended to revolutionize the insurance and pension industries."</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The State of Arizona provides its employees with a voluntary pension plan that allows them to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation until retirement.  If an employee chooses to participate, an amount designated by the employee is withheld from each paycheck and invested by the State on the employee\'s behalf.  When an employee retires, he or she may receive the amount that has accrued in one of three ways.  The employee may withdraw the total amount accrued, arrange for periodic payments of a fixed sum for a fixed time, or use the accrued amount to purchase a life annuity.</p>\n<p>There is no contention that the State\'s plan discriminates between men and women when an employee contributes to the fund.  The plan is voluntary, and each employee may contribute as much as he or she chooses.  Nor does anyone contend that either of the first two methods of repaying the accrued amount at retirement is discriminatory.  Thus, if Arizona had adopted the same contribution plan but provided only the first two repayment options, there would be no dispute that its plan complied with Title VII of the Civil Rights </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1097">Page 463 U. S. 1097</a></p><p> Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V).  The first two options, however, have disadvantages.  If an employee chooses to take a lump-sum payment, the tax liability will be substantial. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The second option ameliorates the tax problem by spreading the receipt of the accrued amount over a fixed period of time.  This option, however, does not guard against the possibility that the finite number of payments selected by the employee will fail to provide income for the remainder of his or her life.</p>\n<p>The third option -- the purchase of a life annuity -- resolves both of these problems.  It reduces an employee\'s tax liability by spreading the payments out over time, and it guarantees that the employee will receive a stream of payments for life.  State law prevents Arizona from accepting the financial uncertainty of funding life annuities.  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 38-871(C)(1) (Supp.1982-1983).  But to achieve tax benefits under federal law, the life annuity must be purchased from a company designated by the retirement plan.  Rev.Rul. 72-25, 1972-1 Cum.Bull. 127; Rev.Rul. 68-99, 1968-1 Cum. Bull 193.  Accordingly, Arizona contracts with private insurance companies to make life annuities available to its employees.  The companies that underwrite the life annuities, as do the vast majority of private insurance companies in the United States, use sex-based mortality tables.  Thus, the only effect of Arizona\'s third option is to allow its employees to purchase at a tax saving the same annuities they otherwise would purchase on the open market.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that Arizona\'s voluntary plan violates Title VII.  In the majority\'s view, Title VII requires an employer to follow one of three courses.  An employer must provide unisex annuities itself, contract with insurance companies to provide such annuities, or provide no annuities to its employees.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1091">463 U. S. 1091</a></span> (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment in part).  The first option is largely illusory.  Most </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1098">Page 463 U. S. 1098</a></p><p> employers do not have either the financial resources or administrative ability to underwrite annuities.  Or, as in this case, state law may prevent an employer from providing annuities.  If unisex annuities are available, an employer may contract with private insurance companies to provide them.  It is stipulated, however, that the insurance companies with which Arizona contracts do not provide unisex annuities, nor do insurance companies generally underwrite them.  The insurance industry either is prevented by state law from doing so [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] or it views unisex mortality tables as actuarially unsound.  An employer, of course, may choose the third option.  It simply may decline to offer its employees the right to purchase annuities at a substantial tax saving.  It is difficult to see the virtue in such a compelled choice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As indicated above, the consequences of the Court\'s holding are unlikely to be beneficial.  If the cost to employers of offering unisex annuities is prohibitive or if insurance carriers choose not to write such annuities, employees will be denied the opportunity to purchase life annuities -- concededly the most advantageous pension plan -- at lower cost. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  If, alternatively, insurance carriers and employers choose to offer these annuities, the heavy cost burden of equalizing benefits probably will be passed on to current employees.  There is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1099">Page 463 U. S. 1099</a></p><p> no evidence that Congress intended Title VII to work such a change.  Nor does <em>Manhart</em> support such a sweeping reading of this statute.  That case expressly recognized the limited reach of its holding -- a limitation grounded in the legislative history of Title VII and the inapplicability of Title VII\'s policies to the insurance industry.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We were careful in <em>Manhart</em> to make clear that the question before us was narrow.  We stated:  "All that is at issue today is a requirement that men and women make unequal contributions to an <em>employer-operated</em> pension fund."  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#717">435 U. S. 717</a></span> (emphasis added).  And our holding was limited expressly to the precise issue before us.  We stated that,</p>\n<p>"[a]lthough we conclude that the Department\'s practice violated Title VII, we do not suggest that the statute was intended to revolutionize the insurance and pension industries."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Manhart</em> had good reason for recognizing the narrow reach of Title VII in the particular area of the insurance industry.  Congress has chosen to leave the primary responsibility for regulating the insurance industry to the respective States.  <em>See</em> McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011 <em>et seq.</em> [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  This Act reflects the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1100">Page 463 U. S. 1100</a></p><p> long-held view that the "continued regulation . . . by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011; <em>see SEC v. National Securities, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/453/case.html">393 U.

Given the consistent policy of entrusting insurance regulation to the States, the majority is not justified in assuming that Congress intended in 1964 to require the industry to change longstanding actuarial methods, approved over decades by state insurance commissions. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1101">Page 463 U. S. 1101</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nothing in the language of Title VII supports this preemption of state jurisdiction.  Nor has the majority identified any evidence in the legislative history that Congress considered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1102">Page 463 U. S. 1102</a></p><p> the widespread use of sex-based mortality tables to be discriminatory or that it intended to modify its previous grant by the McCarran-Ferguson Act of exclusive jurisdiction to the States to regulate the terms of protection offered by insurance companies.  Rather, the legislative history indicates precisely the opposite.</p>\n<p>The only reference to this issue occurs in an explanation of the Act by Senator Humphrey during the debates on the Senate floor.  He stated that it was "unmistakably clear" that Title VII did not prohibit different treatment of men and women under industrial benefit plans. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  <em>See</em> 110 Cong.Rec. 13663-13664 (1964).  As we recognized in <em>Manhart,</em></p>\n<p>"[alt]hough he did not address differences in employee contributions based on sex, Senator Humphrey apparently assumed that the 1964 Act would have little, if any, impact on existing pension plans."</p>\n<p>435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#714">435 U. S. 714</a></span>.  This statement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1103">Page 463 U. S. 1103</a></p><p> was not sufficient, as <em>Manhart</em> held, to preclude the application of Title VII to an <em>employer</em>-operated plan.  <em>See ibid.</em>  But Senator Humphrey\'s explanation provides strong support for <em>Manhart\'s</em> recognition that Congress intended Title VII to have <em>only</em> that indirect effect on the private insurance industry.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>As neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history supports its holding, the majority is compelled to rely on its perception of the policy expressed in Title VII.  The policy, of course, is broadly to proscribe discrimination in employment practices.  But the statute itself focuses specifically on the individual, and "precludes treatment of individuals as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual, or national class."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#708">435 U. S. 708</a></span>.  This specific focus has little relevance to the business of insurance.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#724">435 U. S. 724</a></span> (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Insurance and life annuities exist because it is impossible to measure accurately how long any one individual will live.  Insurance companies cannot make individual determinations of life expectancy; they must consider instead the life expectancy of identifiable groups.  Given a sufficiently large group of people, an insurance company can predict with considerable reliability the rate and frequency of deaths within the group based on the past mortality experience of similar groups.  Title VII\'s concern for the effect of employment practices on the individual thus is simply inapplicable to the actuarial predictions that must be made in writing insurance and annuities.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The accuracy with which an insurance company predicts the rate of mortality depends on its ability to identify groups with similar mortality rates.  The writing of annuities thus requires that an insurance company group individuals according to attributes that have a significant correlation with mortality.  The most accurate classification system would be to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1104">Page 463 U. S. 1104</a></p><p> identify all attributes that have some verifiable correlation with mortality and divide people into groups accordingly, but the administrative cost of such an undertaking would be prohibitive.  Instead of identifying all relevant attributes, most insurance companies classify individuals according to criteria that provide both an accurate and efficient measure of longevity, including a person\'s age and sex.  These particular criteria are readily identifiable, stable, and easily verifiable.  <em>See</em> Benston, The Economics of Gender Discrimination in Employee Fringe Benefits:  <em>Manhart</em> Revisited, 49 U.Chi.L.Rev. 489, 499-501 (1982).</p>\n<p>It is this practice -- the use of a sex-based group classification -- that the majority ultimately condemns.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1083">463 U. S. 1083</a></span>-1086 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment in part).  The policies underlying Title VII, rather than supporting the majority\'s decision, strongly suggest -- at least for me -- the opposite conclusion.  This remedial statute was enacted to eradicate the types of discrimination in employment that then were pervasive in our society.  The entire thrust of Title VII is directed against <em>discrimination</em> --  disparate treatment on the basis of race or sex that intentionally or arbitrarily affects an individual.  But as JUSTICE BLACKMUN has stated, life expectancy is a</p>\n<p>"nonstigmatizing factor that demonstrably differentiates females from males and that is not measurable on an individual basis. . . .  [T]here is nothing arbitrary, irrational, or \'discriminatory\' about recognizing the objective and accepted . . . disparity in female-male life expectancies in computing rates for retirement plans."</p>\n<p><em>Manhart,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#724">435 U.

[<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Sex-based mortality tables reflect objective actuarial experience.  Because their use does not entail discrimination in any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1105">Page 463 U.

And certainly the policy underlying Title VII provides no warrant for extending the reach of the statute beyond Congress\' intent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court held that Arizona\'s voluntary pension plan violates Title VII, and ordered that future annuity payments to female retirees be made equal to payments received by similarly situated men. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] 486 F.Supp. 645 (Ariz.1980).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  671 F.2d 330 (1982).  The Court today affirms the Court of Appeals\' judgment insofar as it holds that Arizona\'s voluntary pension plan violates Title VII.  But this finding of a statutory violation provides no basis for approving the retroactive relief awarded by the District Court.  To approve this award would be both unprecedented and manifestly unjust.</p>\n<p>We recognized in <em>Manhart</em> that retroactive relief is normally appropriate in the typical Title VII case, but concluded that the District Court had abused its discretion in awarding such relief.  435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#719">435 U. S. 719</a></span>.  As we noted, the employer in <em>Manhart</em> may well have assumed that its pension program was lawful.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#720">435 U. S. 720</a></span>.  More importantly, a retroactive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1106">Page 463 U. S. 1106</a></p><p> remedy would have had a potentially disruptive impact on the operation of the employer\'s pension plan.  The business of underwriting insurance and life annuities requires careful approximation of risk.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#721">435 U. S. 721</a></span>.  Reserves normally are sufficient to cover only the cost of funding and administering the plan.  Should an unforeseen contingency occur, such as a drastic change in the legal rules governing pension and insurance funds, both the insurer\'s solvency and the insured\'s benefits could be jeopardized.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>This case presents no different considerations.  <em>Manhart</em> did put all employer-operated pension funds on notice that they could not "requir[e] that men and women make unequal contributions to [the] fund," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#717">435 U. S. 717</a></span>, but it expressly confirmed that an employer could set aside equal contributions and let each retiree purchase whatever benefit his or her contributions could command on the "open market," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#718">435 U. S. 718</a></span>.  Given this explicit limitation, an employer reasonably could have assumed that it would be lawful to make available to its employees annuities offered by insurance companies on the open market.</p>\n<p>As in <em>Manhart,</em> holding employers liable retroactively would have devastating results.  The holding applies to all employer-sponsored pension plans, and the cost of complying with the District Court\'s award of retroactive relief would range from $817 to $1,260 million annually for the next 15 to 30 years. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Department of Labor Cost Study 32.  In this case, the cost would fall on the State of Arizona.  Presumably other state and local governments also would be affected directly by today\'s decision.  Imposing such unanticipated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1107">Page 463 U.

Income, excise, and property taxes are being increased.  There is no justification for this Court, particularly in view of the question left open in <em>Manhart,</em> to impose this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public.  Accordingly, liability should be prospective only.

U.S. Dept. of Labor, Cost Study of the Impact of an Equal Benefits Rule on Pension Benefits 4 (1983) (hereinafter Department of Labor Cost Study).  This minimum cost assumes that employers will be free to use the least costly method of adjusting benefits.  This assumption may be unfounded.  If employers are required to "top up" benefits -- <em>i.e.,</em> calculate women\'s benefits at the rate applicable to men, rather than apply a unisex rate to both men and women -- the cost of providing purely prospective benefits would range from $428 to $676 million each year for at least the next 15 years.  <em>Id.</em> at 31.

The adverse effect of today\'s holding apparently will fall primarily on the State\'s employees.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>When this Court held for the first time that the Federal Government had the power to regulate the business of insurance, <em>see United States v.

S. 533</a></span> (1944) (holding the antitrust laws applicable to the business of insurance), Congress responded by passing the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  As initially proposed, the Act had a narrow focus.  It would have provided only:</p>\n<p>"\'That nothing contained in the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, or the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, shall be construed to apply to the business of insurance or to acts in the conduct of that business or in any wise to impair the regulation of that business by the several States.\'"</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1112, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, p. 2 (1944) (quoting proposed Act).  This narrow version, however, was not accepted.</p>\n<p>Congress subsequently proposed and adopted a much broader bill.  It recognized, as it previously had, the need to accommodate federal antitrust laws and state regulation of insurance.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1945).  But it also recognized that the decision in <em>South-Eastern Underwriters Assn.</em> had raised questions as to the general validity of state laws governing the business of insurance.  Some insurance carriers were reluctant to comply with state regulatory authority, fearing liability for their actions.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 143 at 2.  Congress thus enacted broad legislation</p>\n<p>"so that the several States may know that the Congress desires to protect the continued regulation . . . of the business of insurance by the several States."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The McCarran-Ferguson Act, as adopted, accordingly commits the regulation of the insurance industry presumptively to the States.  The introduction to the Act provides that</p>\n<p>"silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of [the] business [of insurance] by the several States."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011.  Section 2(b) of the Act further provides:</p>\n<p>"No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1012(b).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Most state laws regulating insurance and annuities explicitly proscribe "unfair discrimination between individuals in the same class."  Bailey, Hutchinson, &amp; Narber, The Regulatory Challenge to Life Insurance Classification, 25 Drake L.Rev. 779, 783 (1976) (emphasis omitted).  Arizona insurance law similarly provides that there shall be "[no] unfair discrimination between individuals of the same class."  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 20-448 (Supp.1982-1983).  Most States, including Arizona, have determined that the use of actuarially sound, sex-based mortality tables comports with this state definition of discrimination.  Given the provision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act that Congress intends to supersede state insurance regulation only when it enacts laws that "specifically relat[e] to the business of insurance," <em>see</em> <l=|463 1073fn2="" 5|="" u.s.="">n. 5, <em>supra,</em> the majority offers no satisfactory reason for concluding that Congress intended Title VII to preempt this important area of state regulation.</l=|463></p>\n<p>The majority states that the McCarran-Ferguson Act is not relevant, because the petitioners did not raise the issue in their brief.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1087">463 U. S. 1087</a></span>-1088, n. 17 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment in part).  This misses the point.  The question presented is whether Congress intended Title VII to prevent employers from offering their employees -- pursuant to state law -- actuarially sound, sex-based annuities.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act is explicitly relevant to determining congressional intent.  It provides that courts should not presume that Congress intended to supersede state regulation of insurance unless the Act in question "specifically relates to the business of insurance."  <em>See</em> <l=|463 1073fn2="" 5|="" u.s.="">n. 5, <em>supra.</em>  It therefore is necessary to consider the applicability of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in determining Congress\' intent in Title VII.  This presents two questions:  whether the action at issue under Title VII involves the "business of insurance" and whether the application of Title VII would "invalidate, impair, or supersede" state law.</l=|463></p>\n<p>No one doubts that the determination of how risk should be spread among classes of insureds is an integral part of the "business of insurance."  <em>See Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/205/case.html">440 U.

S. 73</a></span> (1959).  The majority argues, nevertheless, that the McCarran-Ferguson Act is inapposite, because Title VII will not supersede any state regulation.  Because Title VII applies to employers, rather than insurance carriers, the majority asserts that its view of Title VII will not affect the business of insurance.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1087">463 U. S. 1087</a></span>-1088, n. 17 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment in part).  This formalistic distinction ignores self-evident facts.  State insurance laws, such as Arizona\'s, allow employers to purchase sex-based annuities for their employees.  Title VII, as the majority interprets it, would prohibit employers from purchasing such annuities for their employees.  It begs reality to say that a federal law that thus denies the right to do what state insurance law allows does not "invalidate, impair, or supersede" state law.  <em>Cf. SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/65/case.html#67">359 U. S. 67</a></span>.  The majority\'s interpretation of Title VII -- to the extent it banned the sale of actuarially sound, sex-based annuities -- effectively would preempt state regulatory authority.  In my view, the commands of the McCarran-Ferguson Act are directly relevant to determining Congress\' intent in enacting Title VII.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Senator Humphrey\'s statement was based on the adoption of the Bennett Amendment, which incorporated the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 206(d), into Title VII.  <em>See County of Washington v. Gunther,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/161/case.html">452 U. S. 161</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/161/case.html#175">452 U. S. 175</a></span>, n. 15 (1981).  Although not free from ambiguity, the legislative history of the Equal Pay Act provides ample support for Senator Humphrey\'s interpretation of that Act.  In explaining the Equal Pay Act\'s affirmative defenses, the Senate Report on that statute noted that pension costs were "higher for women than men . . . because of the longer life span of women."  S.Rep. No. 176, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1963).  It then explained that the question of additional costs associated with employing women was one "that can only be answered by an <em>ad hoc</em> investigation."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, it concluded that, where it could be shown that there were in fact higher costs for women than men, an exception to the Equal Pay Act could be permitted "similar to those . . . for a bona fide seniority system or other exception noted above."  <em>Ibid.</em> .</p>\n<p>Even if other meanings might be drawn from the Equal Pay Act\'s legislative history, the crucial question is how Congress viewed the Equal Pay Act in 1964 when it incorporated it into Title VII.  The only relevant legislative history that exists on this point demonstrates unmistakably that Congress perceived -- with good reason -- that "the 1964 Act [Title VII] would have little, if any, impact on existing pension plans."  <em>Los Angeles Dept. of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html">435 U.

S. 1092</a></span> (concurring in judgment in part).  Annuity payments are funded by the employee\'s past contributions, and represent a return on those contributions.  In order to provide women with the higher level of periodic payments ordered by the District Court, the State of Arizona would be required to fund retroactively the deficiency in past contributions made by its women retirees.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The cost to employers of equalizing benefits varies according to three factors:  (i) whether the plan is a defined-contribution or a defined-benefit plan; (ii) whether benefits are to be equalized retroactively or prospectively; and (iii) whether the insurer may reallocate resources between men and women by applying unisex rates to existing reserves, or must top up women\'s benefits.  The figures in text assume, as the District Court appeared to hold, <em>see</em> 486 F.Supp. 645, 652 (Ariz.1980), that employers would be required to top up women\'s benefits.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>In this respect, I agree with JUSTICE O\'CONNOR that only benefits derived from contributions collected after the effective date of the judgment need be calculated without regard to the sex of the employee.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1111">463 U. S. 1111</a></span> (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, concurring.</p>\n<p>This case requires us to determine whether Title VII prohibits an employer from offering an annuity plan in which the participating insurance company uses sex-based tables for calculating monthly benefit payments.  It is important to stress that our judicial role is simply to discern the intent of the 88th Congress in enacting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] a statute covering only discrimination in employment.  What we, if sitting as legislators, might consider wise legislative policy is irrelevant to our task.  Nor, as JUSTICE MARSHALL notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1073/case.html#1078">463 U. S. 1078</a></span>-1079, n. 4, do we have before us any constitutional challenge.  Finally, our decision must ignore (and our holding has no necessary effect on) the larger issue of whether considerations of sex should be barred from all insurance plans, including individual purchases of insurance, an issue that Congress is currently debating.  <em>See</em> S. 372, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H.R. 100, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983).</p>\n<p>Although the issue presented for our decision is a narrow one, the answer is far from self-evident.  As with many </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1108">Page 463 U. S. 1108</a></p><p> other narrow issues of statutory construction, the general language chosen by Congress does not clearly resolve the precise question.  Our polestar, however, must be the intent of Congress, and the guiding lights are the language, structure, and legislative history of Title VII.  Our inquiry is made somewhat easier by the fact that this Court, in <em>Los Angeles Dept. of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html">435 U. S. 702</a></span> (1978), analyzed the intent of the 88th Congress on a related question.  The Court in <em>Manhart</em> found Title VII\'s focus on the individual to be dispositive of the present question.  Congress, in enacting Title VII, intended to prohibit an employer from singling out an employee by race or sex for the purpose of imposing a greater burden or denying an equal benefit because of a characteristic statistically identifiable with the group but empirically false in many individual cases.  <em>See Manhart,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#708">435 U. S. 708</a></span>-710.</p>\n<p>Despite JUSTICE POWELL\'s argument, ultimately I am persuaded that the result in <em>Manhart</em> is not distinguishable from the present situation.  <em>Manhart</em> did note that Title VII would allow an employer to set aside equal retirement contributions for each employee and let the retiree purchase whatever annuity his or her accumulated contributions could command on the open market.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#717">435 U. S. 717</a></span>-718.  In that situation, the employer is treating each employee without regard to sex.  If an independent insurance company then classifies persons on the basis of sex, the disadvantaged female worker cannot claim she was denied a privilege of employment, any more than she could complain of employment discrimination when the employer pays equal wages in a community where local merchants charge women more than men for identical items.  As I stressed above, Title VII covers only discrimination in <em>employment,</em> and thus simply does not reach these other situations.</p>\n<p>Unlike these examples, however, the employer here has done more than set aside equal lump sums for all employees.  Title VII clearly does not allow an employer to offer a plan </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1109">Page 463 U. S. 1109</a></p><p> to employees under which it will collect equal contributions, hold them in a trust account, and upon retirement disburse greater monthly checks to men than women.  Nor could an employer escape Title VII\'s mandate by using a third-party bank to hold and manage the account.  In the situation at issue here, the employer has used third-party insurance companies to administer the plan, but the plan remains essentially a "privileg[e] of employment," and thus is covered by Title VII.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a)(1). [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I join Parts I, II, and III of JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s opinion.  Unlike JUSTICE MARSHALL, however, I would not make our holding retroactive.  Rather, for reasons explained below, I agree with JUSTICE POWELL that our decision should be prospective.  I therefore join Part III of JUSTICE POWELL\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>In <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html">404 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#105">404 U. S. 105</a></span>-109 (1971), we set forth three criteria for determining when to apply a decision of statutory interpretation prospectively.  First, the decision must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly overshadowed.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#106">404 U. S. 106</a></span>.  Ultimately, I find this case controlled by the same principles of Title VII articulated by the Court in <em>Manhart.</em>  If this first criterion were the sole consideration for prospectivity, I might find it difficult to make today\'s decision prospective.  As reflected in JUSTICE POWELL\'s opinion, however, whether <em>Manhart</em> foreshadows today\'s decision is sufficiently debatable that the first criterion of the <em>Chevron</em> test does not compel retroactivity here.  Therefore, we must examine the remaining criteria of the <em>Chevron</em> test as well. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1110">Page 463 U. S. 1110</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The second criterion is whether retroactivity will further or retard the operation of the statute.  <em>Chevron, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#106">404 U. S. 106</a></span>-107.  <em>See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html">422 U. S. 405</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#421">422 U. S. 421</a></span> (1975) (backpay should be denied only for reasons that will not frustrate the central statutory purposes).  <em>Manhart</em> held that a central purpose of Title VII is to prevent employers from treating individual workers on the basis of sexual or racial group characteristics.  Although retroactive application will not retard the achievement of this purpose, that goal in no way requires retroactivity.  I see no reason to believe that a retroactive holding is necessary to ensure that pension plan administrators, who may have thought, until our decision today, that Title VII did not extend to plans involving third-party insurers, will not now quickly conform their plans to ensure that individual employees are allowed equal monthly benefits regardless of sex.  <em>See Manhart, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#720">435 U. S. 720</a></span>-721. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In my view, the third criterion -- whether retroactive application would impose inequitable results -- compels a prospective decision in these circumstances.  Many working men and women have based their retirement decisions on expectations of a certain stream of income during retirement.  These decisions depend on the existence of adequate reserves to fund these pensions.  A retroactive holding by this Court that employers must disburse greater annuity benefits than the collected contributions can support would jeopardize the entire pension fund.  If a fund cannot meet its obligations, "[t]he harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties."  <em>Manhart, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#722">435 U. S. 722</a></span>-723.  This real danger of bankrupting pension funds requires that our decision be made prospective.  Such a prospective holding is, of course, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1111">Page 463 U. S. 1111</a></p><p> consistent with our equitable powers under Title VII to fashion an appropriate remedy.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(g); <em>Manhart,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#718">435 U. S. 718</a></span>-719.</p>\n<p>In my view, then, our holding should be made prospective in the following sense.  I would require employers to ensure that benefits derived from contributions collected after the effective date of our judgment be calculated without regard to the sex of the employee. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  For contributions collected before the effective date of our judgment, however, I would allow employers and participating insurers to calculate the resulting benefits as they have in the past.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The 92d Congress made important amendments to Title VII, including extending its coverage to state employers such as the State of Arizona.  The 1972 amendments did not change the substantive requirements of Title VII, however.  Thus, it is the intent of the 88th Congress that is controlling here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The distinction between employment-related discrimination and discrimination not covered by Title VII is ably discussed by Van Alstyne, Equality for Individuals or Equality for Groups:  Implications of the Supreme Court Decision in the <em>Manhart</em> Case, 64 AAUP Bulletin 150 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Another goal of Title VII is to make persons whole for injuries suffered from unlawful employment discrimination.  <em>See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html">422 U. S. 405</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#418">422 U. S. 418</a></span> (1975).  Although this goal would suggest that the present decision should be made retroactive, it does not necessarily control the decision on retroactivity.  <em>See Manhart,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#719">435 U.

The Equal Pay Act proviso, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 206(d)(1), which forbids employers to cure violations of the Act by reducing the wage rate of any employee, would not require that employers "top up" benefits by using male-longevity tables for all workers.  First, although the Bennett Amendment of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(h), incorporates the Equal Pay Act defenses for disparate "compensation" as well as disparate "wages," <em>see Manhart, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#711">435 U. S. 711</a></span>-712, n. 22, the language of the Equal Pay Act proviso seems to apply only to wages.  Thus, it is questionable whether the proviso would apply at all to the retirement plan at issue here.  Second, even if the proviso has some relevance here, it should not be read to require a pension plan, whose entire function is actuarially to balance contributions with outgoing benefits, to calculate benefits on the basis of tables that do not reflect the composition of the workforce.  <em>Cf. Manhart, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/702/case.html#720">435 U. S. 720</a></span>, n. 36 (remedy should at least consider "ordering a refund of only the difference between contributions made by women and the contributions they would have made under an actuarially sound and nondiscriminatory plan").</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
