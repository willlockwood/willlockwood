After gaining three successive time extensions from the Bankruptcy Court, respondent Ryan, Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s creditor, filed a complaint on January 13, 1998, objecting to Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s discharge.  Ryan alleged that Kontrick had transferred property, within one year of filing his petition, with the intent to defraud creditors, and therefore did not qualify for discharge under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7727(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  Ryan filed an amended complaint on May 6, 1998, with leave of court, but without seeking or gaining a court-approved time extension.  The amended complaint alleged with particularity that Kontrick had fraudulently transferred money to his wife, first by removing his own name from the family\xe2\x80\x99s once-joint checking account, then by continuing regularly to deposit his salary checks into the account, from which his wife routinely paid family expenses (the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily-account\xe2\x80\x9d claim).  Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s June 10, 1998, answer to the amended complaint did not raise the untimeliness of the family-account claim; on the merits, the answer admitted the transfers to the family account but denied that Kontrick had violated \xc2\xa7727(a)(2)(A).  In response to Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment motion, which appended a statement of material facts, Kontrick cross-moved to strike portions of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment filings, but did not ask the court to strike the amended complaint\xe2\x80\x99s family-account allegations.  On February 25, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court awarded Ryan summary judgment on the family-account claim, concluding that Kontrick was not entitled to discharge because his transfers to the family account were made with intent to defraud at least creditor Ryan.  Kontrick then moved for reconsideration.  For the first time, Kontrick urged that the court was powerless to adjudicate the family-account claim.  The amended complaint containing that claim, Kontrick observed, was untimely under Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3).  Those rules, Kontrick maintained, establish a mandatory, unalterable time limit of the kind Kontrick called \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Bankruptcy Court denied reconsideration and entered final judgment, holding that Rule 4004\xe2\x80\x99s complaint-filing time instructions are not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Kontrick had waived the right to assert the untimeliness of the amended complaint by failing squarely to raise the point before the court reached the merits of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s objections to discharge.  The District Court sustained the denial of discharge, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  Both courts relied on decisions of sister Circuits holding that the timeliness provisions at issue are not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A debtor forfeits the right to rely on Rule 4004 if the debtor does not raise the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s time limitation before the bankruptcy court reaches the merits of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s objection to discharge.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Only Congress may determine a lower federal court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction.  U. S. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa71.  Congress did so, as pertinent here, by instructing that \xe2\x80\x9cobjections to discharges\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ore proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d within the bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(2)(J).  Congress did not build time constraints into that statutory authorization.  Rather, the time constraints applicable to objections to discharge are contained in Bankruptcy Rules prescribed pursuant to \xc2\xa72075.  Such rules \xe2\x80\x9cdo not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</em> v. <em>Kroger,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/index.html">437 U. S. 365</a>, 370.  As Bankruptcy Rule 9030 states, the Bankruptcy Rules \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  The filing deadlines prescribed in Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) are claim-processing rules that do not delineate what cases bankruptcy courts are competent to adjudicate.  Although Kontrick now concedes that those Rules are not properly labeled \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of describing a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction, he maintains that the Rules have the same import as provisions governing subject-matter jurisdiction.  A litigant generally may raise a court\xe2\x80\x99s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action.  <em>Mansfield, C.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em> v. <em>Swan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/index.html">111 U. S. 379</a>, 382.  Similarly, Kontrick urges, a debtor may challenge a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s objection to discharge as untimely under Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) at any time in the proceedings, even initially on appeal or certiorari.  The equation Kontrick advances overlooks the critical difference between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule.  Characteristically, a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties\xe2\x80\x99 litigation conduct; a claim-processing rule, on the other hand, even if unalterable on a party\xe2\x80\x99s application, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0No reasonable construction of complaint-processing rules would allow a litigant situated as Kontrick is to defeat a claim, as filed too late, after the party has litigated and lost the case on the merits.  The relevant claim-processing rules in this case, Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), include, among their primary purposes, affording the debtor an affirmative defense to a complaint filed outside the Rules 4004(a) and (b) time limits.  It is uncontested that Ryan filed his complaint objecting to Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s discharge outside those limits.  Kontrick urges that nothing occurring thereafter counts, for the Rules\xe2\x80\x99 time prescriptions are unalterable, allowing no recourse to equitable exceptions.  This case, however, involves no issue of equitable tolling or any other equity-based exception.  Neither at the time Ryan filed the amended complaint containing the family-account claim nor anytime thereafter did he assert circumstances\xe2\x80\x94equitable or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94qualifying him for a time extension.  The sole question is whether Kontrick forfeited his right to assert the untimeliness of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint by failing to raise the issue until after that complaint was adjudicated on the merits.  In other words, how long did the affirmative defense Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) afforded Kontrick linger in the proceedings?  The Seventh Circuit followed the proper path on this key question.  It noted that time bars generally must be raised in an answer or responsive pleading.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (made applicable to bankruptcy court adversary proceedings by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7008(a)).  An answer may be amended to include an inadvertently omitted affirmative defense, and even after the time to amend \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d has passed, \xe2\x80\x9cleave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a) (made applicable to adversary proceedings by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7015).  Kontrick not only failed to assert the time constraints of Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) in a pleading or amended pleading responsive to Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint.  In addition, Kontrick moved to delete certain items from Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment filings, but, even that far into the litigation, he did not ask the Bankruptcy Court to strike the family-account claim.  Ordinarily, a defense is lost if it is not included in the answer or amended answer.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7012(b) (Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)\xe2\x80\x93(h) apply in adversary proceedings).  Rules 12(h)(2) and (3) prolong the life of certain defenses, but time prescriptions are not among them.  Even if a defense based on Bankruptcy Rule 4004 could be equated to \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d the issue could be raised, at the latest, \xe2\x80\x9cat the trial on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(2).  Only lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is preserved post-trial.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).  Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to the family-account claim is not of that order.

Under the Bankruptcy Rules governing Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings, a creditor has \xe2\x80\x9c60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors\xe2\x80\x9d to file a complaint objecting to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s discharge.

In the matter before us a creditor, in an untimely pleading, objected to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s discharge.  The debtor, however, did not promptly move to dismiss the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s plea as impermissibly late.  Only after the Bankruptcy Court decided, on the merits, that the discharge should be refused did the debtor, in a motion for reconsideration, urge the untimeliness of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s plea.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bankruptcy Rule 4004\xe2\x80\x99s time prescription, the debtor maintains, is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, dispositive whenever raised in the proceedings.  Rejecting the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d characterization, the courts below held that Rule 4004\xe2\x80\x99s time prescription could not be invoked to upset an adjudication on the merits.  We agree that Rule 4004 is not \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, we hold that a debtor forfeits the right to rely on Rule 4004 if the debtor does not raise the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s time limitation before the bankruptcy court reaches the merits of the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s objection to discharge.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A debtor in a Chapter 7 liquidation case qualifies for an order discharging his debts if he satisfies the conditions stated in \xc2\xa7727(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.  11 U.

Ryan, a major creditor and Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s former associate in a cosmetic and plastic surgery practice, opposed Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s discharge.  After gaining three successive time extensions from the Bankruptcy Court, Ryan filed an original complaint on January 13, 1998, in which he objected to the discharge of any of Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s debts.  Ryan alleged that Kontrick had transferred property, within one year of filing the bankruptcy petition, with intent to defraud creditors, and therefore did not qualify for a discharge under 11 U.

The amended complaint particularized for the first time the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s violation of \xc2\xa7727(a)(2)(A) in this regard: Debtor Kontrick, creditor Ryan alleged, had fraudulently transferred money to Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s wife, first by removing Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s own name from the family\xe2\x80\x99s once-joint checking account, then by continuing regularly to deposit his salary checks into the account, from which his wife routinely paid family expenses (the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily-account\xe2\x80\x9d claim).  <em>Id.,</em> at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kontrick answered Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint on June 10, 1998.

In March 1999, after the parties engaged in acrimonious discovery, Ryan moved for summary judgment.  As Local Bankruptcy Rule 402(M) (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1994) instructs, Ryan appended to his motion \xe2\x80\x9ca statement of material facts as to which [he] contend[ed] there [was] no genuine issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kontrick cross-moved, in August 1999, to strike portions of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment filings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s motion to strike sought deletion of \xe2\x80\x9cnew allegations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, allegations making their first appearance in the litigation in Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment submissions\xe2\x80\x94Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s statement of facts pursuant to Local Rule 402(M), accompanying exhibits, and corresponding portions of the summary judgment motion and memorandum.

Although Kontrick noted that the family-account allegations were stated only in the amended complaint and were absent from the original complaint, <em>id.</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, he did not ask the court to strike those allegations.  His response, instead, and in line with Local Rule 402(N), addressed the substance of the family-account claim.  He admitted taking his name off the account, but observed that he did so \xe2\x80\x9cover four years before bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13.  He also acknowledged that, thereafter, he \xe2\x80\x9cdeposited his paycheck into the account the same way he had always done.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 25, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court ruled on the cross-motions, granting in part Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s motion to strike, awarding summary judgment to Ryan on the family-account claim, and dismissing the remaining claims.  The court used the amended complaint as its baseline; it struck as untimely \xe2\x80\x9callegations not included in [that] complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47; see <em>id.</em>, at 48\xe2\x80\x9350.

That course of conduct, coupled with Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s testimony,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the court concluded, sufficed to prove a violation of \xc2\xa7727(a)(2) (described <em>supra</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01).

He argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over the sole claim on which the court had granted summary judgment, the family-account claim.  See <em>id</em>., at 71.  The court was powerless to adjudicate the claim, Kontrick insisted, because the amended complaint containing the claim was untimely.  Governing Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), see <em>supra</em>, at 3, Kontrick maintained, establish a mandatory, unalterable time limit of the kind he then called \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71.

Kontrick does not contend in this Court that the timing rules in question affect the subject-matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.

Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though Kontrick concedes that Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) are not properly labeled \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of describing a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction, he maintains that the Rules have the same import as provisions governing subject-matter jurisdiction.  A litigant generally may raise a court\xe2\x80\x99s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance.  <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Swan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/index.html">111 U.

Characteristically, a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties\xe2\x80\x99 litigation conduct; a claim-processing rule, on the other hand, even if unalterable on a party\xe2\x80\x99s application, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn back now to the relevant claim-processing rules in this case.  Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), governing proceedings over which bankruptcy courts have subject-matter jurisdiction,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] serve three primary purposes.  First, they inform the pleader, <em>i.e.</em>, the objecting creditor, of the time he has to file a complaint.  Second, they instruct the court on the limits of its discretion to grant motions for complaint-filing-time enlargements.  Third, they afford the debtor an affirmative defense to a complaint filed outside the Rules 4004(a) and (b) limits.  This case involves the third office of the Rules.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is uncontested that creditor Ryan filed his complaint objecting to debtor Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s discharge outside the Rules\xe2\x80\x99 time limits.  Kontrick urges that nothing occurring thereafter counts, for the Rules\xe2\x80\x99 time prescriptions are unalterable, allowing no recourse to \xe2\x80\x9cequitable exceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 13, n.\xc2\xa04; see <em>id.</em>, at 8, 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  This case, however, involves no issue of equitable tolling or any other equity-based exception.  Neither at the time creditor Ryan filed the amended complaint containing the family-account claim nor anytime thereafter did he assert circumstances\xe2\x80\x94equitable or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94qualifying him for a time extension.  Whether the Rules, despite their strict limitations, could be softened on equitable grounds\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] is therefore a question we do not reach.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16 (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]uch of [Kontrick\xe2\x80\x99s] argument is actually directed to an issue that is not presented in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, whether the timing rules here in question are alterable by recourse to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98equitable exceptions imported from outside the rules.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) (quoting Brief for Petitioner 13); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether [the bankruptcy court] would have had discretion to allow a late complaint . . . isn\xe2\x80\x99t before the Court, because [Ryan has not] claimed that [in this case] there is any equitable groun[d] for enlarging or extending the deadline, so that question isn\xe2\x80\x99t presented.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can assume, <em>arguendo</em>, that had Kontrick timely asserted the untimeliness of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint, Kontrick would have prevailed in the litigation.  The question, in that event, would have been \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the time restrictions in th[e] Rules are in such \xe2\x80\x98emphatic form\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as to preclude equitable exceptions.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16 (citation omitted).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Carlisle</em>, 517 U.

Here, however, the sole question is whether Kontrick forfeited his right to assert the untimeliness of Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint by failing to raise the issue until after that complaint was adjudicated on the merits.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  In other words, how long did the affirmative defense Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) afforded Kontrick linger in the proceedings?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, we agree, followed the proper path on this key question.  See 295 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 734\xe2\x80\x93735.  Time bars, that court noted, generally must be raised in an answer or responsive pleading.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (made applicable to adversary proceedings in bankruptcy courts by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7008(a)).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  An answer may be amended to include an inadvertently omitted affirmative defense, and even after the time to amend \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d has passed, \xe2\x80\x9cleave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed.

As earlier recounted, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, Kontrick moved to delete certain items from Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment filings, but, even that far into the litigation, he did not ask the Bankruptcy Court to strike the family- account claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ordinarily, under the Bankruptcy Rules as under the Civil Rules, a defense is lost if it is not included in the answer or amended answer.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7012(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cRule 12(b)\xe2\x80\x93(h) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d); 5A C. Wright &amp; A.

Rules 12(h)(2) and (3) prolong the life of certain defenses, but time prescriptions are not among those provisions.  Even if a defense based on Bankruptcy Rule 4004 could be equated to \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\xe2\x80\x9d the issue could be raised, at the latest, \xe2\x80\x9cat the trial on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed.
