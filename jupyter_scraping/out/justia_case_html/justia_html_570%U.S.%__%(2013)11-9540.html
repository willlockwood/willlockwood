To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those crimes, courts use a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d: They compare the statutory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d crime\xe2\x80\x95i.e., the offense as commonly understood.

The Government sought an ACCA sentence enhancement, pointing to Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 three prior convictions, including one for burglary under California Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7459, which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who enters\xe2\x80\x9d certain locations \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  In imposing an enhanced sentence, the District Court rejected Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 argument that his \xc2\xa7459 conviction cannot serve as an ACCA predicate because \xc2\xa7459 goes beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d definition of burglary.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d 915, permits the application of the modified categorical approach to a prior conviction under a statute that is \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically broader than the generic offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  It found that Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7459 conviction, as revealed in the plea colloquy, rested on facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes like \xc2\xa7459 that contain a single, indivisible set of elements.

In Taylor v. United States, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575\n, and Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13\n, the Court approved the use of a modified categorical approach in a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow range of cases\xe2\x80\x9d in which a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element played a part in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  Because a sentencing court cannot tell, simply by looking at a divisible statute, which version of the offense a defendant was convicted of, the court is permitted to consult extra-statutory documents\xe2\x80\x94but only to assess whether the defendant was convicted of the particular \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory definition\xe2\x80\x9d that corresponds to the generic offense.  Nijhawan v. Holder, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29\n, and Johnson v. United States, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133\n, also emphasized this elements-based rationale for the modified categorical approach.  That approach plays no role here, where the dispute does not concern alternative elements but a simple discrepancy between generic burglary and \xc2\xa7459.

Aguila-Montes has no roots in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  In fact, it subverts those decisions, conflicting with each of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening to undo all its benefits.

The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach runs headlong into that congressional choice.  Instead of reviewing extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative element was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder ACCA, the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases the maximum penalty.  Accordingly, that finding would (at least) raise serious \n \nSixth Amendment concerns if it went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction.  That is why Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed determination about what facts must have supported a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25 (plurality opinion).  Yet the Ninth Circuit flouts this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision also creates the same \xe2\x80\x9cdaunting\xe2\x80\x9d difficulties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the categorical approach.  Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element of the relevant generic offense.  And the Aguila-Montes approach would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea deals.

But the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to imaginatively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavailing.  Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every element of the generic crime.

But that distinction is malleable and manipulable.  And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element, the problem is the same:  Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the generic crime.

If one alternative (say, a building) matches an element in the generic offense, but the other (say, an automobile) does not, the modified categorical approach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction.  The court can then do what the categorical approach demands: compare the elements of the crime of conviction (including the alternative element used in the case) with the elements of the generic crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case presents the question whether sentencing courts may also consult those additional documents when a defendant was convicted under an \xe2\x80\x9cindivisible\xe2\x80\x9d statute\xe2\x80\x94i.e., one not containing alternative elements\xe2\x80\x94that criminalizes a broader swath of conduct than the relevant generic offense.  That would enable a court to decide, based on information about a case\xe2\x80\x99s underlying facts, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate even though the elements of the crime fail to satisfy our categorical test.  Because that result would contravene our prior decisions and the principles underlying them, we hold that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Michael Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g).  That unadorned offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.  The Government, however, sought an enhanced sentence under ACCA, based on Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 prior state convictions for burglary, robbery, and felony harassment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tACCA prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years for a person who violates \xc2\xa7922(g) and \xe2\x80\x9chas three previous convictions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  The Act defines a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to mean any felony, whether state or federal, that \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDescamps argued that his prior burglary conviction could not count as an ACCA predicate offense under our categorical approach.  He had pleaded guilty to violating California Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7459 (West 2010), which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who enters\xe2\x80\x9d certain locations \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  That statute does not require the entry to have been unlawful in the way most burglary laws do.  Whereas burglary statutes generally demand breaking and entering or similar conduct, California\xe2\x80\x99s does not: It covers, for example, a shoplifter who enters a store, like any customer, during normal business hours.  See People v. Barry, 94 Cal. 481, 483\xe2\x80\x93484, 29 P. 1026, 1026\xe2\x80\x931027 (1892).  In sweeping so widely, the state law goes beyond the normal, \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d definition of burglary.  According to Descamps, that asymmetry of offense elements precluded his conviction under \xc2\xa7459 from serving as an ACCA predicate, whether or not his own burglary involved an unlawful entry that could have satisfied the requirements of the generic crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court disagreed.  According to the court, our modified categorical approach permitted it to examine certain documents, including the record of the plea colloquy, to discover whether Descamps had \xe2\x80\x9cadmitted the elements of a generic burglary\xe2\x80\x9d when entering his plea.  App. 50a.  And that transcript, the court ruled, showed that Descamps had done so.  At the plea hearing, the prosecutor proffered that the crime \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0involve[d] the breaking and entering of a grocery store,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and Descamps failed to object to that statement.  Ibid.  The plea proceed- ings, the District Court thought, thus established that Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 prior conviction qualified as a generic burglary (and so as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d) under ACCA.  Applying the requisite penalty enhancement, the court sentenced Descamps to 262 months in prison\xe2\x80\x94more than twice the term he would otherwise have received.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, relying on its recently issued decision in United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915 (2011) (en banc) (per curiam).  There, a divided en banc court took much the same view of the modified categorical approach as had the District Court in this case.  The en banc court held that when a sentencing court considers a conviction under \xc2\xa7459\xe2\x80\x94or any other statute that is \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically broader than the generic offense\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the court may scrutinize certain documents to determine the factual basis of the conviction.  See id., at 940.  Applying that approach, the Court of Appeals here found that Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 plea, as revealed in the colloquy, \xe2\x80\x9crested on facts that satisfy the elements of the generic definition of burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 Fed.

In those decisions, as shown below, the modified approach serves a limited function: It helps effectuate the categorical analysis when a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element played a part in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  So understood, the modified approach cannot convert Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 conviction under \xc2\xa7459 into an ACCA predicate, because that state law defines burglary not alternatively, but only more broadly than the generic offense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe begin with Taylor v. United States, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1990)\n, which established the rule for determining when a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction counts as one of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated predicate offenses (e.g., burglary).  Taylor adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cformal categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d: Sentencing courts may \xe2\x80\x9clook only to the statutory definitions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the elements\xe2\x80\x94of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior offenses, and not \xe2\x80\x9cto the particular facts underlying those convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 600.  If the relevant statute has the same elements as the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d ACCA crime, then the prior conviction can serve as an ACCA predicate; so too if the statute defines the crime more narrowly, because anyone convicted under that law is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. guilty of all the [generic crime\xe2\x80\x99s] elements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 599.  But if the statute sweeps more broadly than the generic crime, a conviction under that law cannot count as an ACCA predicate, even if the defendant actually committed the offense in its generic form.  The key, we emphasized, is elements, not facts.  So, for example, we held that a defendant can receive an ACCA enhancement for burglary only if he was convicted of a crime having \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic elements\xe2\x80\x9d of generic burglary\xe2\x80\x94i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And indeed, we indicated that the very statute at issue here, \xc2\xa7459, does not fit that bill because \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia defines \xe2\x80\x98burglary\xe2\x80\x99 so broadly as to include shoplifting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 591.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, Taylor recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow range of cases\xe2\x80\x9d in which sentencing courts\xe2\x80\x94applying what we would later dub the \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94may look beyond the statutory elements to \xe2\x80\x9cthe charging paper and jury instructions\xe2\x80\x9d used in a case.  Id., at 602.  To explain when courts should resort to that approach, we hypothesized a statute with alternative elements\xe2\x80\x94more particularly, a burglary statute (otherwise conforming to the generic crime) that prohibits \xe2\x80\x9centry of an automobile as well as a building.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  One of those alternatives (a building) corresponds to an element in generic burglary, whereas the other (an automobile) does not.  In a typical case brought under the statute, the prosecutor charges one of those two alternatives, and the judge instructs the jury accordingly.  So if the case involves entry into a building, the jury is \xe2\x80\x9cactually required to find all the elements of generic burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d as the categorical approach demands.  Ibid.  But the statute alone does not disclose whether that has occurred.  Because the statute is \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e., comprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime\xe2\x80\x94a later sentencing court cannot tell, without reviewing something more, if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was for the generic (building) or non-generic (automobile) form of burglary.  Hence Taylor permitted sentencing courts, as a tool for implementing the categorical approach, to examine a limited class of documents to determine which of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s alternative elements formed the basis of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13 (2005)\n, the hypothetical we posited in Taylor became real: We confronted a Massachusetts burglary statute covering entries into \xe2\x80\x9cboats and cars\xe2\x80\x9d as well as buildings.  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 17.  The defendant there pleaded guilty to violating the statute, and we first confirmed that Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach applies not just to jury verdicts, but also to plea agreements.  That meant, we held, that a conviction based on a guilty plea can qualify as an ACCA predicate only if the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily admitted [the] elements of the generic offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 26.  But as we had anticipated in Taylor, the divisible nature of the Massachusetts burglary statute confounded that inquiry: No one could know, just from looking at the statute, which version of the offense Shepard was convicted of.  Accordingly, we again authorized sentencing courts to scrutinize a restricted set of materials\xe2\x80\x94here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to determine if the defendant had pleaded guilty to entering a building or, alternatively, a car or boat.  Ibid.  Yet we again underscored the narrow scope of that review: It was not to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea,\xe2\x80\x9d but only to assess whether the plea was to the version of the crime in the Massachusetts statute (burglary of a building) corresponding to the generic offense.  Id., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (plurality opinion).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo more recent decisions have further emphasized the elements-based rationale\xe2\x80\x94applicable only to divisible statutes\xe2\x80\x94for examining documents like an indictment or plea agreement.  In Nijhawan v. Holder, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29 (2009)\n, we discussed another Massachusetts statute, this one prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0Breaking and Entering at Night\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in any of four alternative places: a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding, ship, vessel, or vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 35.  We recognized that when a statute so \xe2\x80\x9crefer[s] to several different crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d not all of which qualify as an ACCA predicate, a court must determine which crime formed the basis of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  Ibid.  That is why, we explained, Taylor and Shepard developed the modified categorical approach.  By reviewing the extra-statutory materials approved in those cases, courts could discover \xe2\x80\x9cwhich statutory phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d contained within a statute listing \xe2\x80\x9cseveral different\xe2\x80\x9d crimes, \xe2\x80\x9ccovered a prior conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41.  And a year later, we repeated that understanding of when and why courts can resort to those documents: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98modified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99 that we have approved permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Johnson v. United States, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133, \n144 (2010)\n (citation omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplied in that way\xe2\x80\x94which is the only way we have ever allowed\xe2\x80\x94the modified approach merely helps im- plement the categorical approach when a defendant was convicted of violating a divisible statute.  The modified approach thus acts not as an exception, but instead as a tool.  It retains the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99s central feature: a focus on the elements, rather than the facts, of a crime.  And it preserves the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99s basic method: comparing those elements with the generic offense\xe2\x80\x99s.  All the modified approach adds is a mechanism for making that comparison when a statute lists multiple, alternative elements, and so effectively creates \xe2\x80\x9cseveral different .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nijhawan, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41.  If at least one, but not all of those crimes matches the generic version, a court needs a way to find out which the defendant was convicted of.  That is the job, as we have always understood it, of the modified approach: to identify, from among several alternatives, the crime of conviction so that the court can compare it to the generic offense.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe modified approach thus has no role to play in this case.  The dispute here does not concern any list of alternative elements.  Rather, it involves a simple discrepancy between generic burglary and the crime established in \xc2\xa7459.  The former requires an unlawful entry along the lines of breaking and entering.  See 3 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa721.1(a) (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave).  The latter does not, and indeed covers simple shoplifting, as even the Government acknowledges.  See Brief for United States 38; Barry, 94 Cal., at 483\xe2\x80\x93484, 29 P., at 1026\xe2\x80\x931027.  In Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s words, then, \xc2\xa7459 \xe2\x80\x9cdefine[s] burglary more broadly\xe2\x80\x9d than the generic offense.  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599.  And because that is true\xe2\x80\x94because California, to get a conviction, need not prove that Descamps broke and entered\xe2\x80\x94a \xc2\xa7459 violation cannot serve as an ACCA predicate.  Whether Descamps did break and enter makes no difference.  And likewise, whether he ever admitted to breaking and entering is irrelevant.  Our decisions authorize review of the plea colloquy or other approved extra-statutory documents only when a statute defines burglary not (as here) overbroadly, but instead alternatively, with one statutory phrase corresponding to the generic crime and another not.  In that circumstance, a court may look to the additional documents to determine which of the statutory offenses (generic or non-generic) formed the basis of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  But here no uncertainty of that kind exists, and so the categorical approach needs no help from its modified partner.  We know Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 crime of conviction, and it does not correspond to the relevant generic offense.  Under our prior decisions, the inquiry is over.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals took a different view.  Dismissing everything we have said on the subject as \xe2\x80\x9clack[ing] conclusive weight,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ninth Circuit held in Aguila-Montes that the modified categorical approach could turn a conviction under any statute into an ACCA predicate offense.  655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 931.  The statute, like \xc2\xa7459, could contain a single, indivisible set of elements covering far more conduct than the generic crime\xe2\x80\x94and still, a sentencing court could \xe2\x80\x9cconside[r] to some degree the factual basis for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction\xe2\x80\x9d or, otherwise stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular acts the defendant committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 935\xe2\x80\x93936.  More specifically, the court could look to reliable materials (the charging document, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and so forth) to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhat facts\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9cconfident[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d be thought to underlie the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutorial theory of the case\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cfacts put forward by the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 936\xe2\x80\x93937.  It makes no difference, in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, whether \xe2\x80\x9cspecific words in the statute\xe2\x80\x9d of conviction \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0actually required\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the jury (or judge accepting a plea) \xe2\x80\x9cto find a particular generic element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 936 (quoting Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 602; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat approach\xe2\x80\x94which an objecting judge aptly called \xe2\x80\x9cmodified factual,\xe2\x80\x9d 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 948 (Berzon, J., concurring in judgment)\xe2\x80\x94turns an elements-based inquiry into an evidence-based one.  It asks not whether \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory definitions\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily require an adjudicator to find the generic offense, but instead whether the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s case realistically led the adjudicator to make that determi- nation.  And it makes examination of extra-statutory documents not a tool used in a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow range of cases\xe2\x80\x9d to identify the relevant element from a statute with multiple alternatives, but rather a device employed in every case to evaluate the facts that the judge or jury found.  By this point, it should be clear that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s new way of identifying ACCA predicates has no roots in our precedents.  But more: Aguila-Montes subverts those decisions, conflicting with each of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening to undo all its benefits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court offered three grounds for establishing our elements-centric, \xe2\x80\x9cformal categorical approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.  First, it comports with ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s text and history.  Second, it avoids the \n \nSixth Amendment concerns that would arise from sentencing courts\xe2\x80\x99 making findings of fact that properly belong to juries.  And third, it averts \xe2\x80\x9cthe practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 601.  When assessed in light of those three reasons, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling strikes out swinging.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStart with the statutory text and history.  As we have long recognized, ACCA increases the sentence of a defendant who has three \xe2\x80\x9cprevious convictions\xe2\x80\x9d for a violent felony\xe2\x80\x94not a defendant who has thrice committed such a crime.  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(1); see Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.  That language shows, as Taylor explained, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see Shepard, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 19.  If Congress had wanted to increase a sentence based on the facts of a prior offense, it presumably would have said so; other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.  See Nijhawan, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36 (construing an immigration statute as requiring a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98circumstance-specific,\xe2\x80\x99 not a \xe2\x80\x98categorical,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d approach).  But in ACCA, Taylor found, Congress made a deliberate decision to treat every conviction of a crime in the same manner: During the lengthy debate preceding the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, \xe2\x80\x9cno one suggested that a particular crime might sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601.  Congress instead meant ACCA to function as an on-off switch, directing that a prior crime would qualify as a predicate offense in all cases or in none.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach runs headlong into that congressional choice.  Instead of reviewing documents like an indictment or plea colloquy only to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ninth Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the defendant actually did.  Johnson, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 144.  This case demonstrates the point.  Descamps was not convicted of generic burglary, because (as the Government agrees) \xc2\xa7459 does not contain that crime\xe2\x80\x99s required unlawful-entry element.  See Brief for United States 38, 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  At most, the colloquy showed that Descamps committed generic burglary, and so hypothetically could have been convicted under a law criminalizing that conduct.  But that is just what we said, in Taylor and elsewhere, is not enough.  See 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600; Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting such a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0hypothetical approach\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d given a similar statute\xe2\x80\x99s directive to \xe2\x80\x9clook to the conviction itself,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cto what might have or could have been charged\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the necessary result of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s method is exactly the differential treatment we thought Congress, in enacting ACCA, took care to prevent.  In the two years since Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit has treated some, but not other, convictions under \xc2\xa7459 as ACCA predicates, based on minor variations in the cases\xe2\x80\x99 plea documents.  Compare, e.g., 466 Fed. Appx., at 565 (Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7459 conviction counts as generic burglary), with 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 946 (Aguila-Montes\xe2\x80\x99 does not).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, consider (though Aguila-Montes did not) the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment underpinnings.  We have held that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apprendi v. New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466, \n490 (2000)\n.  Under ACCA, the court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases the maximum penalty.  Accordingly, that finding would (at the least) raise serious \n \nSixth Amendment concerns if it went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction.  Those concerns, we recognized in Shepard, counsel against allowing a sentencing court to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a disputed\xe2\x80\x9d determination \xe2\x80\x9cabout what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea,\xe2\x80\x9d or what the jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory of the crime.  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25 (plurality opinion); see id., at 28 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that such a finding would \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[e] rise to constitutional error, not doubt\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence our insistence on the categorical approach.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet again, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling flouts our reasoning\xe2\x80\x94here, by extending judicial factfinding beyond the recog- nition of a prior conviction.  Our modified categorical approach merely assists the sentencing court in identifying the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction, as we have held the \n \nSixth Amendment permits.  But the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reworking authorizes the court to try to discern what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s underlying conduct.  See Aguila-Montes, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 937.  And there\xe2\x80\x99s the constitutional rub.  The \n \nSixth Amendment contemplates that a jury\xe2\x80\x94not a sentencing court\xe2\x80\x94will find such facts, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.  And the only facts the court can be sure the jury so found are those constituting elements of the offense\xe2\x80\x94as distinct from amplifying but legally extraneous circumstances.  See, e.g., Richardson v. United States, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813, \n817 (1999)\n.  Similarly, as Shepard indicated, when a defendant pleads guilty to a crime, he waives his right to a jury determination of only that offense\xe2\x80\x99s elements; whatever he says, or fails to say, about superfluous facts cannot license a later sentencing court to impose extra punishment.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 24\xe2\x80\x9326 (plurality opinion).  So when the District Court here enhanced Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 sentence, based on his supposed acquiescence to a prosecutorial statement (that he \xe2\x80\x9cbroke and entered\xe2\x80\x9d) irrelevant to the crime charged, the court did just what we have said it cannot: rely on its own finding about a non-elemental fact to increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s maximum sentence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision creates the same \xe2\x80\x9cdaunting\xe2\x80\x9d difficulties and inequities that first encouraged us to adopt the categorical approach.  Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601\xe2\x80\x93602.  In case after case, sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant admitted in a plea colloquy, or a prosecutor showed at trial, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfy an element of the relevant generic offense.  The meaning of those documents will often be uncertain.  And the statements of fact in them may be downright wrong.  A defendant, after all, often has little incentive to contest facts that are not elements of the charged offense\xe2\x80\x94and may have good reason not to.  At trial, extraneous facts and arguments may confuse the jury.  (Indeed, the court may prohibit them for that reason.)  And during plea hearings, the defendant may not wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling about superfluous factual allegations.  In this case, for example, Descamps may have let the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s statement go by because it was irrelevant to the proceedings.  He likely was not thinking about the possibility that his silence could come back to haunt him in an ACCA sentencing 30 years in the future.  (Actually, he could not have been thinking that thought: ACCA was not even on the books at the time of Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 burglary conviction.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill worse, the Aguila-Montes approach will deprive some defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea deals.  Assume (as happens every day) that a defendant surrenders his right to trial in exchange for the government\xe2\x80\x99s agreement that he plead guilty to a less serious crime, whose elements do not match an ACCA offense.  Under the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, a later sentencing court could still treat the defendant as though he had pleaded to an ACCA predicate, based on legally extraneous statements found in the old record.  Taylor recognized the problem: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense was the result of a plea bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cit would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty\xe2\x80\x9d to generic burglary.  495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601\xe2\x80\x93602.  That way of proceeding, on top of everything else, would allow a later sentencing court to rewrite the parties\xe2\x80\x99 bargain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit defended its (excessively) modified approach by denying any real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending further than the generic offense.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe only conceptual difference,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cis that [a divisible statute] creates an explicitly finite list of possible means of commission, while [an indivisible one] creates an implied list of every means of commission that otherwise fits the definition of a given crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Aguila-Montes, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 927.  For example, an indivisible statute \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] use of a \xe2\x80\x98weapon\xe2\x80\x99 is not meaningfully different\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or so says the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfrom a statute that simply lists every kind of weapon in existence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. (\xe2\x80\x98gun, axe, sword, baton, slingshot, knife, machete, bat,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In a similar way, every indivisible statute can be imaginatively reconstructed as a divisible one.  And if that is true, the Ninth Circuit asks, why limit the modified categorical approach only to explicitly divisible statutes?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe simple answer is: Because only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every element of the generic crime.  A prosecutor charging a violation of a divisible statute must generally select the relevant element from its list of alternatives.  See, e.g., The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 104 (1874) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n indictment or a criminal information which charges the person accused, in the disjunctive, with being guilty of one or of another of several offences, would be destitute of the necessary certainty, and would be wholly insufficient\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And the jury, as instructions in the case will make clear, must then find that element, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.  So assume, along the lines of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s example, that a statute criminalizes assault with any of eight specified weapons; and suppose further, as the Ninth Circuit did, that only assault with a gun counts as an ACCA offense.  A later sentencing court need only check the charging documents and instructions (\xe2\x80\x9cDo they refer to a gun or something else?\xe2\x80\x9d) to determine whether in convicting a defendant under that divisible statute, the jury necessarily found that he committed the ACCA-qualifying crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNone of that is true of an overbroad, indivisible stat- ute.  A sentencing court, to be sure, can hypothetically reconceive such a statute in divisible terms.  So, as Aguila-Montes reveals, a court blessed with sufficient time and imagination could devise a laundry list of potential \xe2\x80\x9cweapons\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not just the eight the Ninth Circuit mentioned, but also (for starters)  grenades, pipe bombs, spears, tire irons, BB guns, nunchucks, and crossbows.  But the thing about hypothetical lists is that they are, well, hypothetical.  As long as the statute itself requires only an indeterminate \xe2\x80\x9cweapon,\xe2\x80\x9d that is all the indictment must (or is likely to) allege and all the jury instructions must (or are likely to) mention.  And most important, that is all the jury must find to convict the defendant.  The jurors need not all agree on whether the defendant used a gun or a knife or a tire iron (or any other particular weapon that might appear in an imagined divisible statute), because the actual statute requires the jury to find only a \xe2\x80\x9cweapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  And even if in many cases, the jury could have readily reached consensus on the weapon used, a later sentencing court cannot supply that missing judgment. Whatever the underlying facts or the evidence presented, the defendant still would not have been convicted, in the deliberate and considered way the Constitution guarantees, of an offense with the same (or narrower) elements as the supposed generic crime (assault with a gun).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, accepting the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reasoning would altogether collapse the distinction between a categorical and a fact-specific approach.  After all, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cweapons\xe2\x80\x9d example is just the tip of the iceberg: Courts can go much further in reconceiving indivisible statutes as impliedly divisible ones.  In fact, every element of every statute can be imaginatively transformed as the Ninth Circuit suggests\xe2\x80\x94so that every crime is seen as containing an infinite number of sub-crimes corresponding to \xe2\x80\x9call the possible ways an individual can commit\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Aguila-Montes, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 927.  (Think: Professor Plum, in the ballroom, with the candlestick?; Colonel Mustard, in the conservatory, with the rope, on a snowy day, to cover up his affair with Mrs. Peacock?)  If a sentencing court, as the Ninth Circuit holds, can compare each of those \xe2\x80\x9cimplied .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. means of commission\xe2\x80\x9d to the generic ACCA offense, ibid. (emphasis deleted), then the categorical approach is at an end.  At that point, the court is merely asking whether a particular set of facts leading to a conviction conforms to a generic ACCA offense.  And that is what we have expressly and repeatedly forbidden.

They may not, by pretending that every fact pattern is an \xe2\x80\x9cimplied\xe2\x80\x9d statutory definition, Aguila-Montes, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 927, convert that approach into its opposite.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government tries to distance itself from the Ninth Circuit by offering a purportedly narrower theory\xe2\x80\x94that although an indivisible statute that is \xe2\x80\x9ctruly missing\xe2\x80\x9d an element of the generic offense cannot give rise to an ACCA conviction, California\xe2\x80\x99s burglary law can do so because it merely \xe2\x80\x9ccontains a broader version of the [generic] element of unlawfulness of entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument proceeds in three steps.  It begins from the premise that sentencing courts applying ACCA should consider not only the statute defining a prior crime but also any judicial interpretations of it.  Next, the Government points to a California decision holding (not surprisingly) that a defendant cannot \xe2\x80\x9cburglariz[e] his own home\xe2\x80\x9d; the case\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, the Government notes, is that \xc2\xa7459 (though not saying so explicitly) requires \xe2\x80\x9can entry which invades a possessory right.\xe2\x80\x9d  People v. Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d 709, 713\xe2\x80\x93716, 542 P. 2d 1365, 1367\xe2\x80\x931368 (1975).  Given that precedent, the Government contends, \xc2\xa7459 includes a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful entry\xe2\x80\x9d element, although it is broader than the generic crime\xe2\x80\x99s analogous requirement.  Finally, the Government asserts that sentencing courts may use the modified approach \xe2\x80\x9cto determine whether a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under\xe2\x80\x9d such an overbroad statute actually \xe2\x80\x9cwas for [the] generic\xe2\x80\x9d crime.  Brief for United States 11.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough elaborately developed in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, this argument\xe2\x80\x99s first two steps turn out to be sideshows.  We may reserve the question whether, in determining a crime\xe2\x80\x99s elements, a sentencing court should take account not only of the relevant statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, but of judicial rulings interpreting it.  And we may assume, as the Government insists, that California caselaw treats \xc2\xa7459 as including an element of entry \xe2\x80\x9cinvading a possessory right\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94although, truth be told, we find the state decisions on that score contradictory and confusing.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Even on those assumptions, \xc2\xa7459\xe2\x80\x99s elements do not come into line with generic burglary\xe2\x80\x99s.  As the Government concedes, almost every entry onto another\xe2\x80\x99s property with intent to steal\xe2\x80\x94including, for example, a shoplifter\xe2\x80\x99s walking into an open store\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinvades a possessory right\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7459.  See Brief for United States 38; Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d, at 714, 542 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1367.  By contrast, generic burglary\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful-entry element excludes any case in which a person enters premises open to the public, no matter his intent; the generic crime requires breaking and entering or similar unlawful activity.  See Brief for United States 38; LaFave \xc2\xa721.1(a).  So everything rests on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s third point: that this mismatch does not preclude applying the modified categorical approach, because it results not from a missing element but instead from an element\xe2\x80\x99s overbreadth.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut for starters, we see no principled way to make that distinction.  Most overbroad statutes can also be characterized as missing an element; and most statutes missing an element can also be labeled overbroad.  Here is the only conclusion in Aguila-Montes we agree with: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is difficult, if not impossible\xe2\x80\x9d to determine which is which.  655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 925.  The example that court gave was as follows: A statute of conviction punishes possession of pornography, but a federal law carries a sentence enhancement for possession of child pornography.  Is the statute of conviction overbroad because it includes both adult and child pornography; or is that law instead missing the element of involvement of minors?  The same name game can be played with \xc2\xa7459.  The Government labors mightily to turn what it fears looks like a missing-element statute into an overbroad statute through the incorporation of judicial decisions.  But even putting those decisions aside, the Government might have described \xc2\xa7459 as merely having an overbroad element because \xe2\x80\x9centry\xe2\x80\x9d includes both the lawful and the unlawful kind.  And conversely, Descamps could claim that even as judicially inter- preted, \xc2\xa7459 is entirely missing generic burglary\xe2\x80\x99s ele- ment of breaking and entering or similar unlawful conduct.  All is in the eye of the beholder, and prone to endless manipulation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, and more fundamentally, we see no reason why the Government\xe2\x80\x99s distinction should matter.  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element, the problem is the same: Because of the mismatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the generic crime.  In this case, for example, Descamps was not convicted of generic burglary because \xc2\xa7459, whether viewed as missing an element or containing an overbroad one, does not require breaking and entering.  So every reason we have given\xe2\x80\x94textual, constitutional, and practical\xe2\x80\x94for rejecting the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s proposed approach applies to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s as well.  See supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316.  At bottom, the Government wants the same thing as the Ninth Circuit (if nominally in a few fewer cases): It too wishes a sentencing court to look beyond the elements to the evidence or, otherwise said, to explore whether a person convicted of one crime could also have been convicted of another, more serious offense.  But that circumstance-specific review is just what the categorical approach precludes.  And as we have explained, we adopted the modified approach to help implement the categorical inquiry, not to undermine it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDescamps may (or may not) have broken and entered, and so committed generic burglary.  But \xc2\xa7459\xe2\x80\x94the crime of which he was convicted\xe2\x80\x94does not require the factfinder (whether jury or judge) to make that determination.  Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alternative element, of \xc2\xa7459, a conviction under that statute is never for generic burglary.  And that decides this case in Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 favor; the District Court should not have enhanced his sentence under ACCA.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That court and the Ninth Circuit erred in invoking the modified categorical approach to look behind Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 conviction in search of record evidence that he actually committed the generic offense.  The modified approach does not authorize a sentencing court to substitute such a facts-based inquiry for an elements-based one.  A court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.

And more important, it would have been news to the Taylor, Shepard, and Johnson Courts: All those decisions rested on the explicit premise that the laws \xe2\x80\x9ccontain[ed] statutory phrases that cover several different .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d not several different methods of committing one offense.

The District Court, however, applied an Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement with a mandatory minimum of 15 years based in part on Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 earlier California conviction for burglary.  See \xc2\xa7924(e).  The California law says that any \xe2\x80\x9cperson who enters\xe2\x80\x9d any of a number of structures \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  California Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7459 (West 2010).  That law does not, on its face, require the jury to determine whether the entry itself was unlawful, a required element of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d offense of burglary that qualifies as an ACCA predicate.  See Taylor v. United States, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, \n599 (1990)\n.  The majority holds that a court may not review the underlying facts of Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 state crime to determine whether he entered the building unlawfully and, thus, that his burglary conviction may not be used as a predicate offense under ACCA.  While I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, I disagree with its reasoning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI have previously explained that ACCA runs afoul of Apprendi v. New Jersey, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466 (2000)\n, because it allows the judge to \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] a finding that raises [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  James v. United States, \n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192, \n231 (2007)\n (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under the logic of Apprendi, a court may not find facts about a prior conviction when such findings increase the statutory maximum.  This is so whether a court is determining whether a prior conviction was entered, see 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 520\xe2\x80\x93521 (Thomas, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what facts were necessary to a prior conviction.  See James, su- pra, at 231\xe2\x80\x93232 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  In either case, the court is inappropriately finding a fact that must be submitted to the jury because it \xe2\x80\x9cincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apprendi, supra, at 490.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the foregoing, it does not matter whether a statute is \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cindivisible,\xe2\x80\x9d see ante, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and courts should not have to struggle with the contours of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  Ibid.  The only reason Descamps\xe2\x80\x99 ACCA enhancement is before us is \xe2\x80\x9cbecause this Court has not yet reconsidered Almendarez-Torres v. United States, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1998)\n, which draws an exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial factfinding that concerns a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, \n27 (2005)\n (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Regardless of the framework adopted, judicial factfinding increases the statutory maximum in violation of the \n \nSixth Amendment.  However, because today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion at least limits the situations in which courts make factual determinations about prior convictions, I concur in the judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970714">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x939540\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tMATTHEW ROBERT DESCAMPS, PETITIONER v.

Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F.\xc2\xa03d 915 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (per\xc2\xa0curiam); United States v. Beardsley, 691 F.\xc2\xa03d 252 (CA2 2012).  This category is used to describe a class of criminal statutes that are drafted with a single set of elements that are broader than those of the generic definition of the corresponding crime enumerated in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJust one of the substantial concerns that the Court is correct to consider is that, in the regular course of the criminal process, convictions may be entered, often by guilty pleas, when either the attorney or the client, or both, have given no consideration to possible later consequences under ACCA.  See ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  As a result, certain facts in the documents approved for judicial examination in Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13 (2005)\n, may go uncontested because they do not alter the sentencing consequences of the crime, even though their effect is to require a later enhancement under ACCA.  This significant risk of failing to consider the full consequences of the plea and conviction is troubling. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBalanced against this, as Justice Alito indicates, is that the dichotomy between divisible and indivisible state criminal statutes is not all that clear.  See post, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (dissenting opinion).  The effect of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, more-over, is that an unspecified number, but likely a large number, of state criminal statutes that are indivisible but that often do reach serious crimes otherwise subject to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions, now must be amended by state legislatures.  Otherwise, they will not meet federal requirements even though they would have come within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s terms had the state statute been drafted in a different way.  This is an intrusive demand on the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn due consideration, the concerns well expressed by the Court persuade me that it reaches the correct result.  The disruption to the federal policy underlying ACCA, nevertheless, is troubling and substantial.  See post, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (Alito, J., dissenting).  If Congress wishes to pursue its policy in a proper and efficient way without mandat- ing uniformity among the States with respect to their criminal statutes for scores of serious offenses, and without requiring the amendment of any number of federal criminal statutes as well, Congress should act at once.  It may then determine whether ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s design and structure should be modified to meet the concerns expressed both by the Court and the dissenting opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970716">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x939540\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tMATTHEW ROBERT DESCAMPS, PETITIONER v.

This is so, according to the Court, because (1) burglary under California law is broader than so-called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94unlawfully entering or remaining in a building with the intent to commit a crime; (2) the California burglary statute is not \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) our \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be used in a case involving an indivisible statute.  Even when it is apparent that a California burglary conviction was based on what everyone imagines when the term \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d is mentioned\xe2\x80\x94e.g., breaking into a home to steal valuables\xe2\x80\x94that conviction, the Court holds, must be ignored.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would give ACCA a more practical reading.  When it is clear that a defendant necessarily admitted or the jury necessarily found that the defendant committed the elements of generic burglary, the conviction should qualify.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s burglary conviction meets that requirement, and I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore petitioner was charged in the case now before us, he had already compiled a criminal record that included convictions in Washington State for assault and threatening to kill a judge, and convictions in California for robbery and burglary.  See App. 11a\xe2\x80\x9312a; 466 Fed. Appx. 563, 565 (CA9 2012).  After his release from custody for these earlier crimes, petitioner fired a gun in the direction of a man who supposedly owed him money for methamphetamine, and as a result, he was charged in federal court with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  A jury found him guilty, and the District Court imposed an enhanced sentence under ACCA because he had the requisite number of previous convictions for \xe2\x80\x9ca violent felony or a serious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e).  ACCA defines a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include a \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s California bur-glary conviction fit this definition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the concept of a conviction for burglary might seem simple, things have not worked out that way under our case law.  In Taylor v. United States, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, \n599 (1990)\n, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA means what we called \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, the \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Determining whether a burglary conviction qualifies under this definition is easy if the elements set out in the state statute are the same as or narrower than the elements of generic burglary, see ibid., but what if the state offense is broader?  In that event, we have held, a federal court may sometimes apply what we have termed the \xe2\x80\x9cmodified categorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, it may examine some items in the state-court record, including charging documents, jury instructions, and statements made at guilty plea proceedings, to determine if the defendant was actually found to have committed the elements of the generic offense.  See Shepard v. United States, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, \n20 (2005)\n; Taylor, supra, at 602.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner argues that his 1978 conviction for burglary under California Penal Code \xc2\xa7459 does not qualify as a burglary conviction for ACCA purposes because of the particular way in which this provision is worded.  Section 459 provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who enters\xe2\x80\x9d certain locations \xe2\x80\x9cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7459 (West 2010).  This provision is broader than generic burglary in two respects.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first, which does not preclude application of the modified categorical approach, concerns the place burglarized.  While generic burglary applies only to offenses involving the entry of a building, the California provision also reaches offenses involving the entry of some other locations, see ibid.  Under our cases, however, a federal court considering whether to apply ACCA may determine, based on an examination of certain relevant documents, whether the conviction was actually based on the entry of a building and, if it was, may impose an increased sentence.  See Johnson v. United States, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133, \n144 (2010)\n; Nijhawan v. Holder, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29, \n35 (2009)\n; Shepard, supra, at 26.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second variation is more consequential.  Whereas generic burglary requires an entry that is unlawful or unprivileged, the California statute refers without qualification to \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very person who enters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7459.  Petitioner argues, and the Court agrees, that this discrepancy renders the modified categorical approach inapplicable to his California burglary conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court holds that \xe2\x80\x9csentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is based on the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cdivisible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindivisible\xe2\x80\x9d statutes, it is important to identify precisely what this taxonomy means.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMy understanding is that a statute is divisible, in the sense used by the Court, only if the offense in question includes as separate elements all of the elements of the generic offense.  By an element, I understand the Court to mean something on which a jury must agree by the vote required to convict under the law of the applicable jurisdiction.  See ante, at 14 (citing Richardson v. United States, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813, \n817 (1999)\n).  And although the Court reserves decision on the question whether a sentencing court may take authoritative judicial decisions into account in identifying the elements of a statute, see ante, at 20, I will assume that a sentencing court may do so.  While the elements of a criminal offense are generally set out in the statutory text, courts sometimes find that unmentioned elements are implicit.  See, e.g., Neder v. United States, \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n20 (1999)\n (holding that federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes require proof of materiality even though that element is not mentioned in the statutory text).  I cannot think of any reason why an authoritative decision of this sort should be ignored, and the Court has certainly not provided any.  I therefore proceed on the assumption that a statute is divisible if the offense, as properly construed, has the requisite elements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the modified categorical approach may be used only when a statute is divisible in this sense is not required by ACCA or by our prior cases and will cause serious practical problems.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing in the text of ACCA mandates the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on the elements of an offense.

It is quite likely that the entry of a building and the entry of a vessel were simply alternative means of satisfying an element.  See Commonwealth v. Cabrera, 449 Mass. 825, 827, 874 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 654, 657 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe elements of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony are (1) breaking and (2) entering a building, ship, vessel or vehicle belonging to another (3) at night, (4) with the intent to commit a felony\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9c[L]egislatures frequently enumerate alternative means of committing a crime without intending to define separate elements or separate crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schad v. Arizona, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, \n636 (1991)\n (plurality).  The feature that distinguishes elements and means is the need for juror agreement, see Richardson, supra, at 817, and therefore in determining whether the entry of a building and the entry of a vessel are elements or means, the critical question is whether a jury would have to agree on the nature of the place that a defendant entered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA case that we decided earlier this Term illustrates why \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d may have been means and not separate elements.  In Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), we were required to determine whether a \xe2\x80\x9cfloating home\xe2\x80\x9d (a buoyant but not very sea-worthy dwelling) was a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Seven of us thought it was not; two of us thought it might be.  Compare id., at ___ (slip op. at 1), with id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  Suppose that a defendant in Massachusetts was charged with breaking into a structure like the Lozman floating home.  In order to convict, would it be necessary for the jury to agree whether this structure was a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d?  If some jurors insisted it was a building and others were convinced it was a vessel, would the jury be hung?  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the Court, if a defendant had been charged with burglarizing the Lozman floating home and this Court had been sitting as the jury, the defendant would have escaped conviction for burglary, no matter how strong the evidence, because the \xe2\x80\x9cjury\xe2\x80\x9d could not agree on whether he burglarized a building or a vessel.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI have not found a Massachusetts decision squarely on point, but there is surely an argument that the Massachusetts Legislature did not want to demand juror agreement on this question.  In other words, there is a strong argument that entry of a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d and entry of a \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x9d are merely alternative means, not alternative elements.  And if that is so, the reasoning in Shepard undermines the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the modified categorical approach focuses solely on elements and not on conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJohnson, like Shepard, involved a statute that may have set out alternative means, rather than alternative elements.  Under the Florida statute involved in that case, a battery occurs when a person either \xe2\x80\x9c1.  [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or 2.  [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7784.03(1)(a) (2010).  It is a distinct possibility (one not foreclosed by any Florida decision of which I am aware) that a conviction under this provision does not require juror agreement as to whether a defendant firmly touched or lightly struck the victim.  Nevertheless, in Johnson, we had no difficulty concluding that the modified categorical approach could be applied.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 137.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFar from mandating the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, these decisions support a practical understanding of the modified categorical approach.  Thus, in Shepard, we observed that the factual circumstances of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction may be relevant to determining whether it qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA.  See 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (\xe2\x80\x9cWith such material in a pleaded case, a later court could generally tell whether the plea had \xe2\x80\x98necessarily\xe2\x80\x99 rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic, just as the details of instructions could support that conclusion in the jury case, or the details of a generically limited charging document would do in any sort of case\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added; citation omitted)); id., at 24 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cDevelopments in the law since Taylor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provide a further reason to adhere to the demanding requirement that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a prior conviction \xe2\x80\x98necessarily\xe2\x80\x99 involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); id., at 25 (noting that, in the context of a nongeneric burglary statute, unless the charging documents \xe2\x80\x9cnarro[w] the charge to generic limits, the only certainty of a generic finding lies in jury instructions, or bench-trial findings and rulings, or (in a pleaded case) in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And in Nijhawan, we departed from the categorical approach altogether and instead applied a \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance-specific\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  See 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36, 38.  If anything, then, Nijhawan undermines the major-ity\xe2\x80\x99s position that rigid adherence to elements is always required.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court fears that application of the modified categorical approach to statutes such as \xc2\xa7459 would be unfair to defendants, who \xe2\x80\x9coften ha[ve] little incentive to contest facts that are not elements of the charged offense\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay not wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling about superfluous factual allegations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  This argument attributes to criminal defendants and their attorneys a degree of timidity that may not be realistic.  But in any event, even if a defendant does not think it worthwhile to \xe2\x80\x9csquabbl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d about insignificant factual allegations, a defendant clearly has an incentive to dispute allegations that may have a bearing on his sentence.  And that will often be the case when alternative elements or means suggest different degrees of culpability.  Cf. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7460 (providing that burglary of certain inhabited locations enumerated in \xc2\xa7459 is punishable in the first degree, and that burglary of all other locations is punishable in the second degree).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, I must concede, does have one benefit: It provides an extra measure of assurance that a burglary conviction will not be counted as an ACCA predicate unless the defendant, if he went to trial, was actually found by a jury to have committed the elements of the generic offense.  But this extra bit of assurance will generally be quite modest at best.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo see why this is so, compare what would happen under an indivisible burglary statute that simply requires entry invading a possessory right, and a divisible statute that has the following two alternative elements: (1) entry by trespass and (2) entry by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent.  Under the former statute, the jury would be required to agree only that the defendant invaded a possessory right when entering the place in question, and therefore it would be possible for the jury to convict even if some jurors thought that the defendant entered by trespassing while others thought that he entered by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent.  Under the latter statute, by contrast, the jury would have to agree either that he trespassed or that he entered by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis requirement of unanimity would be of some practical value only if the evidence in a case pointed to both possibilities, and in a great many cases that will not be so.  In cases prosecuted under the California burglary statute, I suspect, the evidence generally points either to a trespassory entry, typically involving breaking into a building or other covered place, or to an entry by invitation but with an undisclosed criminal intent (in many cases, shoplifting).  Cases in which the evidence suggests that the defendant might have done either are probably not common.  And in cases where there is evidence supporting both theories, the presence of a divisible statute containing alternative elements will not solve the problem: A guilty verdict will not reveal the alternative on which the jury agreed unless the jury was asked to return a special verdict, something that is not generally favored in criminal cases.  See 6 LaFave \xc2\xa724.10(a), at 543\xe2\x80\x93544.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn cases that end with a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x94and most do\xe2\x80\x94the benefit of divisibility is even less.  A judge who accepts a guilty plea is typically required to confirm that there is a factual basis for the plea, see 5 id., \xc2\xa721.4(f), at 835\xe2\x80\x93840 (3d ed. 2007 and Supp. 2011\xe2\x80\x932012), and the proffer of a factual basis will generally focus exclusively on one of the alternative elements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court nevertheless suggests that the extra modicum of assurance provided in cases involving divisible statutes is needed to prevent violations of the \n \nSixth Amendment jury trial right, ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315, but I disagree.  So long as a judge applying ACCA is determining, not what the defendant did when the burglary in question was committed, but what the jury in that case necessarily found or what the defendant, in pleading guilty, necessarily admitted, the jury trial right is not infringed.  See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, \n\n523 U. S. 224 (1998)\n.  When the modified categorical approach is used to decide whether \xe2\x80\x9ca jury was actually required to find all the elements of [a] generic [offense],\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant has already enjoyed his \n \nSixth Amendment right to a jury determination of those elements.

What I have said about the statutes involved in Shepard and Johnson illustrates this point.  The Court assumes that those statutes were divisible, but as I have explained, it is possible that they were not.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo determine whether a statute contains alternative elements, as opposed to merely alternative means of satisfying an element, a court called upon to apply ACCA will be required to look beyond the text of the statute, which may be deceptive.  Take, for example, Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated \xc2\xa7750.82(1) (West 2004), which criminal-izes assault with \xe2\x80\x9ca gun, revolver, pistol, knife, iron bar, club, brass knuckles, or other dangerous weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court seems to assume that a statute like this enumerates alternative elements, ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, but the Michigan courts have held otherwise.  Under Michigan law, the elements of \xc2\xa7750.82(1) are \xe2\x80\x9c(1) an assault, (2) with a dangerous weapon, and (3) with the intent to injure or place the victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery.\xe2\x80\x9d  People v. Avant, 235 Mich. App. 499, 505, 597 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 864, 869 (1999).  Although the statute lists numerous types of weapons, the particular type of weapon is not itself an element that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  Instead, the list of weapons in the statute merely enumerates alternative means of committing the crime.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if a federal court applying ACCA discovers a state-court decision holding that a particular fact must be alleged in a charging document, its research is not at an end.  Charging documents must generally include factual allegations that go beyond the bare elements of the crime\xe2\x80\x94specifically, at least enough detail to permit the defendant to mount a defense.  See 5 LaFave \xc2\xa719.3(b), at 276.  And some jurisdictions require fairly specific factual allegations.  See, e.g., N.\xc2\xa0Y. Crim. Proc.

One of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for adopting the modified categorical approach was to simplify the work of ACCA courts, see Shepard, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 20; Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today will not serve that end.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will also frustrate fundamental ACCA objectives.

Neither petitioner nor his attorney voiced any objection.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Ibid.  In order to accept petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s plea, the trial court was required under California law to ensure that the plea had a factual basis, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71192.5 (1978); App. 26a, and we must presume that the plea proceedings were conducted in a regular manner, see Parke v. Raley, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20\n\xe2\x80\x9330 (1992).  The unmistakable inference arising from the plea transcript is that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x94quite reasonably\xe2\x80\x94understood petitioner and his attorney to assent to the factual basis provided by the prosecutor.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had admitted and, as a practical matter, was convicted for having committed the elements of generic burglary, and we did not agree to review that fact-bound determination, see 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012) (granting certiorari \xe2\x80\x9climited to Question 1 presented by the petition\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if that determination is reviewed, however, the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion should be sustained.  Under the California burglary statute, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court, a defendant must either (a) commit a trespass in entering the location in question or (b) enter in violation of some other possessory right.  See People v. Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d 709, 713\xe2\x80\x93714, 542 P. 2d 1365, 1367 (1975).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, the judge who accepted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea must have relied on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s implicit admission that he \xe2\x80\x9cbroke\xe2\x80\x9d into the store, for if petitioner had admitted only that he entered the store, the judge would not have been able to assess whether he had invaded a possessory right.  Nor would an admission to merely \xe2\x80\x9centering\xe2\x80\x9d the store have permitted the judge to assess whether petitioner entered with the intent to commit a crime; petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s admission to \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking\xe2\x80\x9d was therefore critical to that element, as well.  Cf. Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 236 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (\xe2\x80\x9cBreaking\xe2\x80\x9d denotes the \xe2\x80\x9ctearing away or removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches, or other fastenings intended to secure it, or otherwise exerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to commit a felony\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have explained that burglary under \xc2\xa7924(e) means \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Taylor, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 598.  Based on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea and the Shepard documents, it is clear that petitioner necessarily admitted the elements of generic burglary.  He unlawfully entered a building with the intent to commit a crime.  Accordingly, I would hold that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under \xc2\xa7459 qualifies as a conviction for \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0However, because the Shepard documents did not reveal whether Johnson had been found to have touched or struck, we had to determine whether the relatively innocuous phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d another person\xe2\x80\x94constituted physical force for purposes of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).

United States, \n, may also have involved a statute that was not divisible, but the situation is less clear.  There, the defendant had several Missouri burglary convictions, and Missouri had several different burglary provisions in effect at the time in question.  See id., at 578, n.\xc2\xa01.  The particular provision involved in each of those cases was not certain.  Ibid.  At least one of those provisions, however, may not have been divisible.  That provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7560.070 (1969) (repealed), applied not only to buildings but also to \xe2\x80\x9cany booth or tent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cany boat or vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9crailroad car.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is not entirely clear whether a Missouri court would have required jurors to agree on a particular choice from this list.  In State v. Vandergriff, 403 S. W. 2d 579, 581 (Mo. 1966), the Missouri Supreme Court held that an information was deficient because it \xe2\x80\x9comitted a description of the type of building that might be burglarized as defined by \xc2\xa7560.070, and thereby omitted an essential element of the offense of burglary in the second degree.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because an information must generally include factual details that go beyond the elements of an offense, see 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa719.3(b), p. 276 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave), it is possible that the Missouri court did not mean to say that the type of building was an element in the sense in which I understand the Court to use the term here.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The board game Clue, to which the Court refers, see ante, at 18,does not provide sound legal guidance.
