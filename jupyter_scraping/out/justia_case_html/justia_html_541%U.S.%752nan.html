PUBLICCITIZEN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION et al. <em>v.</em> \nPUBLIC CITIZEN et al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93358. Argued April 21, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 7, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental impact of their proposals and actions in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), but Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s proposed action neither is categorically excluded from the EIS production requirement nor would clearly require production of an EIS.  An agency that decides, pursuant to an EA, that no EIS is required must issue a \xe2\x80\x9cfinding of no significant impact\xe2\x80\x9d (FONSI).  The Clean Air Act (CAA) leaves States to develop \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation plans\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with national air quality standards mandated by the Act, and requires federal agencies\xe2\x80\x99 actions to \xe2\x80\x9cconform\xe2\x80\x9d to those state plans, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77506(c)(1).  In 1982, Congress enacted a moratorium, prohibiting, <em>inter alia, </em>Mexican motor carriers from obtaining operating authority within the United States and authorizing the President to lift the moratorium.  In 2001, the President announced his intention to lift the moratorium once new regulations were prepared to grant operating authority to Mexican motor carriers.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) published one proposed rule addressing the application form for such carriers and another addressing the establishment of a safety-inspection regime for carriers receiving operating authority.  Congress subsequently provided, in \xc2\xa7350 of a DOT appropriations Act, that no funds appropriated could be obligated or expended to review or process any Mexican motor carrier\xe2\x80\x99s applications until FMCSA implemented specific application and safety-monitoring requirements.  Acting pursuant to NEPA, FMCSA issued an EA for its proposed rules.  The EA did not consider the environmental impact that might be caused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks in the United States, concluding that any such impact would be an effect of the moratorium\xe2\x80\x99s modification, not the regulations\xe2\x80\x99 implementation.  Concluding that the regulations\xe2\x80\x99 issuance would have no significant environmental impact, FMCSA issued a FONSI.  In subsequent interim rules, FMCSA relied on the EA and FONSI to demonstrate compliance with NEPA, and determined that any emissions increase from the regulations would fall below the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (EPA) threshold levels needed to trigger a conformity review under the CAA.  Before the moratorium was lifted, respondents sought judicial review of the proposed rules, arguing that their promulgation violated NEPA and the CAA.  The Court of Appeals agreed, finding the EA deficient because it did not consider the environmental impact of lifting the moratorium, when that action was reasonably foreseeable at the time FMCSA prepared the EA and directing FMCSA to prepare an EIS and a full CAA conformity determination for the regulations. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because FMCSA lacks discretion to prevent cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, neither NEPA nor the CAA requires FMCSA to evaluate the environmental effects of such operations.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A).  Respondents argue that the issuance of a FONSI was arbitrary and capricious because the EA did not take into account the environmental effects of an increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.  The relevant question, under NEPA, is whether that increase, and the correlative release of emissions, is an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect,\xe2\x80\x9d 40 CFR \xc2\xa71508.8, of FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s rules; if not, FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address these effects in the EA did not violate NEPA, and the FONSI\xe2\x80\x99s issuance cannot be arbitrary and capricious.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Respondents have forfeited any objection to the EA on the ground that it did not adequately discuss potential alternatives to the proposed action because respondents never identified in their comments to the rules any alternatives beyond those the EA evaluated.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that the EA must take the increased cross-border operations\xe2\x80\x99 environmental effects into account because \xc2\xa7350\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure bar makes it impossible for any Mexican truck to operate in the United States until the regulations are issued, and hence the trucks\xe2\x80\x99 entry is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonably foreseeable\xe2\x80\x9d indirect effect of the issuance of the regulations.  40 CFR \xc2\xa71508.8.  Critically, that argument overlooks FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s inability to countermand the President\xe2\x80\x99s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to exclude Mexican trucks from operating in the United States.  While \xc2\xa7350 restricted FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to authorize such operations, FMCSA remains subject to 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713902(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that it register any motor carrier willing and able to comply with various safety and financial responsibility rules.  Only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican trucks before 2001.  Respondents must rest on \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation, where an agency\xe2\x80\x99s action is considered a cause of an environmental effect even when the agency has no authority to prevent the effect.  However, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.  NEPA requires a \xe2\x80\x9creasonably close causal relationship\xe2\x80\x9d akin to proximate cause in tort law.  <em>Metropolitan Edison Co.</em> v. <em>People Against Nuclear Energy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/766/index.html">460 U. S. 766</a>, 774.  Also, inherent in NEPA and its implementing regulations is a \xe2\x80\x9crule of reason,\xe2\x80\x9d which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any new potential information to the decisionmaking process.  The underlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, as informed by the \xe2\x80\x9crule of reason,\xe2\x80\x9d make clear that the causal connection between the proposed regulations and the entry of Mexican trucks is insufficient to make FMCSA responsible under NEPA to consider the environmental effects of entry.  Neither of the purposes of NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s EIS requirement\xe2\x80\x94to ensure both that an agency has information to make its decision and that the public receives information so it might also play a role in the decisionmaking process\xe2\x80\x94will be fulfilled by requiring FMCSA to consider the environmental impact at issue.  Since FMCSA has no ability to prevent such cross-border operations, it lacks the power to act on whatever information might be contained in an EIS and could not act on whatever input the public could provide.  This analysis is not changed by the CEQ regulation requiring an agency to evaluate the \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative impact\xe2\x80\x9d of its action, 40 CFR \xc2\xa71508.7, since that rule does not require FMCSA to treat the lifting of the moratorium itself or the consequences from that lifting as an effect of its rules promulgation.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0FMCSA did not act improperly by not performing a full conformity analysis pursuant to the CAA and relevant regulations.  To ensure that its actions are consistent with 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77606, a federal agency must undertake \xe2\x80\x9ca conformity determination \xe2\x80\xa6 where the total of direct and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or maintenance area caused by [the] action would equal or exceed\xe2\x80\x9d certain threshold levels established by the EPA.  40 CFR \xc2\xa793.153(b).  \xe2\x80\x9cDirect emissions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9care caused or initiated by the Federal action and occur at the same time and place as the action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa793.152; and \xe2\x80\x9cindirect emissions\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9ccaused by the Federal action\xe2\x80\x9d but may occur later in time, and may be practicably controlled or maintained by the federal agency, <em>ibid.</em>  Some sort of  \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation is sufficient for evaluating causation in the conformity review process.  See <em>ibid</em>.  Because it excluded emissions attributable to the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the United States, FMCSA concluded that its regulations would not exceed EPA thresholds.  Although arguably FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed regulations would be \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causes of the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States, such trucks\xe2\x80\x99 emissions are not \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d because they will not occur at the same time or place as the promulgation of the regulations.  And they are not \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d because FMCSA cannot practicably control or maintain control over the emissions: FMCSA has no ability to countermand the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to lift the moratorium or to act categorically to prevent Mexican carriers from registering and Mexican trucks from entering the country; and once the regulations are promulgated, FMCSA will not be able to regulate any aspect of vehicle exhaust from those trucks.

Because FMCSA lacks discretion to prevent these cross-border operations, we conclude that these statutes impose no such requirement on FMCSA.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Due to the complex statutory and regulatory provisions implicated in this case, we begin with a brief overview of the relevant statutes.

S. 332</a>, 350 (1989).  Rather, NEPA imposes only procedural requirements on federal agencies with a particular focus on requiring agencies to undertake analyses of the environmental impact of their proposals and actions.  See <em>id</em>., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  At the heart of NEPA is a requirement that federal agencies</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cinclude in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\xe2\x80\x94(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, (iii) alternatives to the proposed action, (iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man\xe2\x80\x99s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74332(2)(C).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This detailed statement is called an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ), established by NEPA with authority to issue regulations interpreting it, has promulgated regulations to guide federal agencies in determining what actions are subject to that statutory requirement.  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa71500.3 (2003).  The CEQ regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited document, an Environmental Assessment (EA), if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s proposed action neither is categorically excluded from the requirement to produce an EIS nor would clearly require the production of an EIS.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71501.4(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  The EA is to be a \xe2\x80\x9cconcise public document\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]riefly provide[s] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an [EIS].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71508.9(a).  If, pursuant to the EA, an agency determines that an EIS is not required under applicable CEQ regulations, it must issue a \xe2\x80\x9cfinding of no significant impact\xe2\x80\x9d (FONSI), which briefly presents the reasons why the proposed agency action will not have a significant impact on the human environment.

In 1970, Congress substantially amended the CAA into roughly its current form.  84 Stat. 1713.  The 1970 amendments mandated national air quality standards and deadlines for their attainment, while leaving to the States the development of \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation plan[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with the federal standards.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1977, Congress again amended the CAA, 91 Stat. 749, to prohibit the Federal Government and its agencies from \xe2\x80\x9cengag[ing] in, support[ing] in any way or provid[ing] financial assistance for, licens[ing] or permit[ting], or approv[ing], any activity which does not conform to [a state] implementation plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77506(c)(1).  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cconformity\xe2\x80\x9d includes restrictions on, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9cincreas[ing] the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdelay[ing] timely attainment of any standard \xe2\x80\xa6 in any area.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77506(c)(1)(B).

FMCSA has a variety of statutory mandates, including \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d safety, \xc2\xa731136, establishing minimum levels of financial responsibility for motor carriers, \xc2\xa731139, and prescribing federal standards for safety inspections of commercial motor vehicles, \xc2\xa731142.  Importantly, FMCSA has only limited discretion regarding motor vehicle carrier registration: It must grant registration to all domestic or foreign motor carriers that are \xe2\x80\x9cwilling and able to comply with\xe2\x80\x9d the applicable safety, fitness, and financial-responsibility requirements.  \xc2\xa713902(a)(1).

Before 1982, motor carriers domiciled in Canada and Mexico could obtain certification to operate within the United States from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1982, Congress, concerned about discriminatory treatment of United States motor carriers in Mexico and Canada, enacted a 2-year moratorium on new grants of operating authority.  Congress authorized the President to extend the moratorium beyond the 2-year period if Canada or Mexico continued to interfere with United States motor carriers, and also authorized the President to lift or modify the moratorium if he determined that doing so was in the national interest.  49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710922(l)</em> (1982 ed.).  Although the moratorium on Canadian motor carriers was quickly lifted, the moratorium on Mexican motor carriers remained, and was extended by the President.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 1992, the leaders of Mexico, Canada, and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 32 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0M. 605 (1993).  As part of NAFTA, the United States agreed to phase out the moratorium and permit Mexican motor carriers to obtain operating authority within the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interior by January 2000.  On NAFTA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date (January 1, 1994), the President began to lift the trade moratorium by allowing the licensing of Mexican carriers to provide some bus services in the United States.  The President, however, did not continue to ease the moratorium on the timetable specified by NAFTA, as concerns about the adequacy of Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of motor carrier safety remained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government of Mexico challenged the United States\xe2\x80\x99 implementation of NAFTA\xe2\x80\x99s motor carrier provisions under NAFTA\xe2\x80\x99s dispute-resolution process, and in February 2001, an international arbitration panel determined that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cblanket refusal\xe2\x80\x9d of Mexican motor carrier applications breached the United States\xe2\x80\x99 obligations under NAFTA.  App. 279, \xc2\xb6  ;295.  Shortly thereafter, the President made clear his intention to lift the moratorium on Mexican motor carrier certification following the preparation of new regulations governing grants of operating authority to Mexican motor carriers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2001, FMCSA published for comment proposed rules concerning safety regulation of Mexican motor carriers.  One rule (the Application Rule) addressed the establishment of a new application form for Mexican motor carriers that seek authorization to operate within the United States.  Another rule (the Safety Monitoring Rule) addressed the establishment of a safety-inspection regime for all Mexican motor carriers that would receive operating authority under the Application Rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2001, Congress enacted the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, 115 Stat. 833.  Section 350 of this Act, <em>id., </em>at 864, provided that no funds appropriated under the Act could be obligated or expended to review or to process any application by a Mexican motor carrier for authority to operate in the interior of the United States until FMCSA implemented specific application and safety-monitoring requirements for Mexican carriers.  Some of these requirements went beyond those proposed by FMCSA in the Application and Safety Monitoring Rules.  Congress extended the \xc2\xa7350 conditions to appropriations for Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2002, acting pursuant to NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s mandates, FMCSA issued a programmatic EA for the proposed Application and Safety Monitoring Rules.  FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s EA evaluated the environmental impact associated with three separate scenarios: where the President did not lift the moratorium; where the President did but where (contrary to what was legally possible) FMCSA did not issue any new regulations; and the Proposed Action Alternative, where the President would modify the moratorium and where FMCSA would adopt the proposed regulations.  The EA considered the environmental impact in the categories of traffic and congestion, public safety and health, air quality, noise, socioeconomic factors, and environmental justice.  Vital to the EA\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, was the assumption that there would be no change in trade volume between the United States and Mexico due to the issuance of the regulations.  FMCSA did note that \xc2\xa7350\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions made it impossible for Mexican motor carriers to operate in the interior of the United States before FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of the regulations.  But, FMCSA determined that \xe2\x80\x9cthis and any other associated effects in trade characteristics would be the result of the modification of the moratorium\xe2\x80\x9d by the President, not a result of FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of the proposed safety regulations.  App. 60.  Because FMCSA concluded that the entry of the Mexican trucks was not an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d of its regulations, it did not consider any environmental impact that might be caused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The particular environmental effects on which the EA focused, then, were those likely to arise from the increase in the number of roadside inspections of Mexican trucks and buses due to the proposed regulations.  The EA concluded that these effects (such as a slight increase in emissions, noise from the trucks, and possible danger to passing motorists) were minor and could be addressed and avoided in the inspections process itself.  The EA also noted that the increase of inspection-related emissions would be at least partially offset by the fact that the safety requirements would reduce the number of Mexican trucks operating in the United States.  Due to these calculations, the EA concluded that the issuance of the proposed regulations would have no significant impact on the environment, and hence FMCSA, on the same day as it released the EA, issued a FONSI.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 19, 2002, FMCSA issued the two interim rules, delaying their effective date until May 3, 2002, to allow public comment on provisions that FMCSA added to satisfy the requirements of \xc2\xa7350.  In the regulatory preambles, FMCSA relied on its EA and its FONSI to demonstrate compliance with NEPA.  FMCSA also addressed the CAA in the preambles, determining that it did not need to perform a \xe2\x80\x9cconformity review\xe2\x80\x9d of the proposed regulations under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77506(c)(1) because the increase in emissions from these regulations would fall below the Environmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (EPA\xe2\x80\x99s) threshold levels needed to trigger such a review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2002, the President lifted the moratorium on qualified Mexican motor carriers.  Before this action, however, respondents filed petitions for judicial review of the Application and Safety Monitoring Rules, arguing that the rules were promulgated in violation of NEPA and the CAA.

According to the Court of Appeals, FMCSA was required to consider the environmental effects of the entry of Mexican trucks because \xe2\x80\x9cthe President\xe2\x80\x99s rescission of the moratorium was \xe2\x80\x98reasonably foreseeable\xe2\x80\x99 at the time the EA was prepared and the decision not to prepare an EIS was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1022 (quoting 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71508.7, 1508.8(b) (2003)).  Due to this perceived deficiency, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for preparation of a full EIS.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also directed FMCSA to prepare a full CAA conformity determination for the challenged regulations.  It concluded that FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s determination that emissions attributable to the challenged rules would be below the threshold levels was not reliable because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s CAA determination reflected the \xe2\x80\x9cillusory distinction between the effects of the regulations themselves and the effects of the presidential rescission of the moratorium on Mexican truck entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1030.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 540 U.

Here, FMCSA based its FONSI upon the analysis contained within its EA; respondents argue that the issuance of the FONSI was arbitrary and capricious because the EA\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was flawed.  In particular, respondents criticize the EA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take into account the various environmental effects caused by the increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under NEPA, an agency is required to provide an EIS only if it will be undertaking a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor Federal actio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly affect[s] the quality of the human environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

Under applicable CEQ regulations, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ajor Federal action\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa71508.18 (2003).  \xe2\x80\x9cEffects\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude: (a) Direct effects, which are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c(b) Indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71508.8.  Thus, the relevant question is whether the increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, with the correlative release of emissions by Mexican trucks, is an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d of FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of the Application and Safety Monitoring Rules; if not, FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address these effects in its EA did not violate NEPA, and so FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of a FONSI cannot be arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To answer this question, we begin by explaining what this case does <em>not</em> involve.  What is not properly before us, despite respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument to the contrary, see Brief for Respondents 38\xe2\x80\x9341, is any challenge to the EA due to its failure properly to consider possible alternatives to the proposed action (<em>i.e.</em>, the issuance of the challenged rules) that would mitigate the environmental impact of the authorization of cross-border operations by Mexican motor carriers.  Persons challenging an agency\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with NEPA must \xe2\x80\x9cstructure their participation so that it \xe2\x80\xa6 alerts the agency to the [parties\xe2\x80\x99] position and contentions,\xe2\x80\x9d in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration.  <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/519/index.html">435 U. S. 519</a>, 553 (1978).  None of the respondents identified in their comments any rulemaking alternatives beyond those evaluated in the EA, and none urged FMCSA to consider alternatives.  Because respondents did not raise these particular objections to the EA, FMCSA was not given the opportunity to examine any proposed alternatives to determine if they were reasonably available.  Respondents have therefore forfeited any objection to the EA on the ground that it failed adequately to discuss potential alternatives to the proposed action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, the agency bears the primary responsibility to ensure that it complies with NEPA, see <em>ibid.</em>, and an EA\xe2\x80\x99s or an EIS\xe2\x80\x99 flaws might be so obvious that there is no need for a commentator to point them out specifically in order to preserve its ability to challenge a proposed action.  But that situation is not before us.  With respect to FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to mitigate, respondents can argue only that FMCSA could regulate emissions from Mexican trucks indirectly, through making the safety-registration process more onerous or by removing older, more polluting trucks through more effective enforcement of motor carrier safety standards.  But respondents fail to identify any evidence that shows that any effect from these possible actions would be significant, or even noticeable, for air-quality purposes.  The connection between enforcement of motor carrier safety and the environmental harms alleged in this case is also tenuous at best.  Nor is it clear that FMCSA could, consistent with its limited statutory mandates, reasonably impose on Mexican carriers standards beyond those already required in its proposed regulations.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this point aside, respondents have only one complaint with respect to the EA: It did not take into account the environmental effects of increased cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that FMCSA was required to consider these effects is simple.  Under \xc2\xa7350, FMCSA is barred from expending any funds to process or review any applications by Mexican motor carriers until FMCSA implemented a variety of specific application and safety-monitoring requirements for Mexican carriers.  This expenditure bar makes it impossible for any Mexican motor carrier to receive authorization to operate within the United States until FMCSA issued the regulations challenged here.  The promulgation of the regulations, the argument goes, would \xe2\x80\x9ccaus[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the entry of Mexican trucks (and hence also cause any emissions such trucks would produce), and the entry of the trucks is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably foreseeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa71508.8 (2003).  Thus, the argument concludes, under the relevant CEQ regulations, FMCSA must take these emissions into account in its EA when evaluating whether to produce an EIS.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument, however, overlooks a critical feature of this case: FMCSA has no ability to countermand the President\xe2\x80\x99s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from operating within the United States.  To be sure, \xc2\xa7350 did restrict the ability of FMCSA to authorize cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, but Congress did not otherwise modify FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory mandates.  In particular, FMCSA remains subject to the mandate of 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713902(a)(1), that FMCSA \xe2\x80\x9c<em>shall</em> register a person to provide transportation \xe2\x80\xa6 as a motor carrier if [it] finds that the person is willing and able to comply with\xe2\x80\x9d the safety and financial responsibility requirements established by the Department of Transportation.  (Emphasis added.)  Under FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify <em>any</em> motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001.  App. 51\xe2\x80\x9355.  Thus, upon the lifting of the moratorium, if FMCSA refused to authorize a Mexican motor carrier for cross-border services, where the Mexican motor carrier was willing and able to comply with the various substantive safety and financial responsibilities rules, it would violate \xc2\xa713902(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If it were truly impossible for FMCSA to comply with both \xc2\xa7350 and \xc2\xa713902(a)(1), then we would be presented with an irreconcilable conflict of laws.  As the later enacted provision, \xc2\xa7350 would quite possibly win out.  See <em>Posadas</em> v. <em>National City Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/497/index.html">296 U. S. 497</a>, 503 (1936).  But FMCSA can easily satisfy both mandates: It can issue the application and safety inspection rules required by \xc2\xa7350, and start processing applications by Mexican motor carriers and authorize those that satisfy \xc2\xa713902(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s conditions.  Without a conflict, then, FMCSA must comply with all of its statutory mandates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents must rest, then, on a particularly unyielding variation of \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation, where an agency\xe2\x80\x99s action is considered a cause of an environmental effect even when the agency has no authority to prevent the effect.  However, a \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causal relationship is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.  As this Court held in <em>Metropolitan Edison Co.</em> v. <em>People Against Nuclear Energy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/766/index.html">460 U. S. 766</a>, 774 (1983), NEPA requires \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonably close causal relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between the environmental effect and the alleged cause.  The Court analogized this requirement to the \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In particular, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must look to the underlying policies or legislative intent in order to draw a manageable line between those causal changes that may make an actor responsible for an effect and those that do not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 774, n.\xc2\xa07.

See <em>Marsh</em>, 490 U. S., at 373\xe2\x80\x93374.  Where the preparation of an EIS would serve \xe2\x80\x9cno purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in light of NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory scheme as a whole, no rule of reason worthy of that title would require an agency to prepare an EIS.  See <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R. Co.</em> v. <em>Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP),</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/289/index.html">422 U. S. 289</a>, 325 (1975); see also 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71500.1(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c) (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these circumstances, the underlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, as informed by the \xe2\x80\x9crule of reason,\xe2\x80\x9d make clear that the causal connection between FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s issuance of the proposed regulations and the entry of the Mexican trucks is insufficient to make FMCSA responsible under NEPA to consider the environmental effects of the entry.  The NEPA EIS requirement serves two purposes.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t ensures that the agency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robertson,</em> 490 U. S., at 349.  Second, it \xe2\x80\x9cguarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Requiring FMCSA to consider the environmental effects of the entry of Mexican trucks would fulfil neither of these statutory purposes.  Since FMCSA has no ability categorically to prevent the cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, the environmental impact of the cross-border operations would have no effect on FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking\xe2\x80\x94FMCSA simply lacks the power to act on whatever information might be contained in the EIS.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the informational purpose is not served.  The \xe2\x80\x9cinformational role\xe2\x80\x9d of an EIS is to \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[e] the public the assurance that the agency \xe2\x80\x98has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co.</em> [v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/87/index.html">462 U. S. 87</a>, 97 (1983)], and, perhaps more significantly, provid[e] a springboard for public comment\xe2\x80\x9d in the agency decisionmaking process itself, <em>ibid</em>.  The purpose here is to ensure that the \xe2\x80\x9clarger audience,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, can provide input as necessary to the agency making the relevant decisions.  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa71500.1(c) (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cNEPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is not to generate paperwork\xe2\x80\x94even excellent paperwork\xe2\x80\x94but to foster excellent action.  The NEPA process is intended to help public officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences, and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71502.1 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to serve as an action-forcing device to insure that the policies and goals defined in the Act are infused into the ongoing programs and actions of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x9d).  But here, the \xe2\x80\x9clarger audience\xe2\x80\x9d can have no impact on FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking, since, as just noted, FMCSA simply could not act on whatever input this \xe2\x80\x9clarger audience\xe2\x80\x9d could provide.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would not, therefore, satisfy NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crule of reason\xe2\x80\x9d to require an agency to prepare a full EIS due to the environmental impact of an action it could not refuse to perform.  Put another way, the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not</em> FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the mora-\ntorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consideration of the CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative impact\xe2\x80\x9d regulation does not change this analysis.  An agency is required to evaluate the \xe2\x80\x9c[c]umulative impact\xe2\x80\x9d of its action, which is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71508.7.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative impact\xe2\x80\x9d regulation required FMCSA to consider the \xe2\x80\x9cincremental impact\xe2\x80\x9d of the safety rules themselves, in the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s lifting of the moratorium and other relevant circumstances.  But this is exactly what FMCSA did in its EA.  FMCSA appropriately and reasonably examined the incremental impact of its safety rules assuming the President\xe2\x80\x99s modification of the moratorium (and, hence, assuming the increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers).  The \xe2\x80\x9ccumulative impact\xe2\x80\x9d regulation does not require FMCSA to treat the lifting of the moratorium itself, or consequences from the lifting of the moratorium, as an effect of its promulgation of its Application and Safety Monitoring Rules.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d of the effect.  Hence, under NEPA and the implementing CEQ regulations, the agency need not consider these effects in its EA when determining whether its action is a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor Federal action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the President, not FMCSA, could authorize (or not authorize) cross-border operations from Mexican motor carriers, and because FMCSA has no discretion to prevent the entry of Mexican trucks, its EA did not need to consider the environmental effects arising from the entry.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the CAA, a federal \xe2\x80\x9cdepartment, agency, or instrumentality\xe2\x80\x9d may not, generally, \xe2\x80\x9cengage in, support in any way or provide financial assistance for, license or permit, or approve, any activity\xe2\x80\x9d that violates an applicable State air-quality implementation plan.  42 U.

See 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa793.150(b), 93.153(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  However, an agency is exempt from the general conformity determination under the CAA if its action would not cause new emissions to exceed certain threshold emission rates set forth in \xc2\xa793.153(b).  FMCSA determined that its proposed regulations would not cause emissions to exceed the relevant threshold amounts and therefore concluded that the issuance of its regulations would comply with the CAA.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\xe2\x80\x9366a, 155a.  Critical to its calculations was its consideration of only those emissions that would occur from the increased roadside inspections of Mexican trucks; like its NEPA analysis, FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s CAA analysis did not consider any emissions attributable to the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rules provide that \xe2\x80\x9ca conformity determination is required for each pollutant where the total of direct and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or maintenance area caused by a Federal action would equal or exceed\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe threshold levels established by the EPA.  40 CFR \xc2\xa793.153(b).  \xe2\x80\x9cDirect emissions\xe2\x80\x9d are defined as those covered emissions \xe2\x80\x9cthat are caused or initiated by the Federal action and occur at the same time and place as the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa793.152.

In particular, emissions are \xe2\x80\x9c[c]aused by\xe2\x80\x9d a Federal action if the \xe2\x80\x9cemissions \xe2\x80\xa6 would not \xe2\x80\xa6 occur in the absence of the Federal action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Thus, the EPA has made clear that for purposes of evaluating causation in the conformity review process, some sort of \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causation is sufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although arguably FMCSA\xe2\x80\x99s proposed regulations would be \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d causes of the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States, the emissions from these trucks are neither \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d emissions.  First, the emissions from the Mexican trucks are not \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d because they will not occur at the same time or at the same place as the promulgation of the regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, FMCSA cannot practicably control, nor will it maintain control, over these emissions.  As discussed above, FMCSA does not have the ability to countermand the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to lift the moratorium, nor could it act categorically to prevent Mexican carriers from being registered or Mexican trucks from entering the United States.  Once the regulations are promulgated, FMCSA would have no ability to regulate any aspect of vehicle exhaust from these Mexican trucks.  FMCSA could not refuse to register Mexican motor carriers simply on the ground that their trucks would pollute excessively.  FMCSA cannot determine whether registered carriers actually will bring trucks into the United States, cannot control the routes the carriers take, and cannot determine what the trucks will emit.  Any reduction in emissions that would occur at the hands of FMCSA would be mere happenstance.  It cannot be said that FMCSA \xe2\x80\x9cpracticably control[s]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwill maintain control\xe2\x80\x9d over the vehicle emissions from the Mexican trucks, and it follows that the emissions from the Mexican trucks are not \xe2\x80\x9cindirect emissions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans, 58 Fed.

See Brief for Respondents 42.  But such an argument overlooks NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s core focus on improving agency decisionmaking.  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71500.1, 1500.2, 1502.1 (2003).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals and respondents contend that the EA contained numerous other errors, but their contentions are premised on the conclusion that FMCSA was required to take into account the increased cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that Congress ratified the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision when it, after the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, reenacted \xc2\xa7350 in two appropriations bills.  The doctrine of ratification states that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is presumed to be aware of [a] \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 580 (1978).  But this case involves the interpretation of NEPA and the CAA, not \xc2\xa7350.  Indeed, the precise requirements of \xc2\xa7350 were not below, and are not here, in dispute.  Hence, congressional reenactment of \xc2\xa7350 tells us nothing about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 view as to the requirements of NEPA and the CAA, and so, on the legal issues involved in this case, Congress has been entirely silent.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
