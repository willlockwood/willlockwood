The defendant rejoined that the sum of money in the condition mentioned, lent by him to Watson, could not be recovered from the latter or his endorser.</p>\n<p>To this rejoinder the plaintiff demurred specially</p>\n<p>1st.  Because the defendant doth not state, in his rejoinder, that he used all legal means for the recovery of the said $2,500 of Watson, and his endorser.</p>\n<p>2d.

Because the defendant is bound to pay one-half of the sum that is not recovered of the said Watson, or his endorser, and if the defendant has not received any part of the $2,500 of the said Watson or his endorser, then he is bound by the condition of the said bond to pay one-half of the sum of $2,500 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>4th.  Because the defendant does not give any answer as to the sum of $500, stated in the condition of the said bond to have been received by him of the said Watson before the execution of the said bond.</p>\n<p>5th.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The plaintiff declares upon a bond dated the 3 October, and upon oyer, the bond appears to bear date 3 January preceding.</p>\n<p>By the oyer, the bond is made a part of the declaration.  There were several pleadings, and among the rest, a bad declaration, a bad rejoinder, and a special demurrer by the plaintiff to this bad rejoinder.  When the whole pleadings are thus spread upon the record by a demurrer, it is the duty of the court to examine the whole, and go to the first error.  When the special demurrer is by the plaintiff, his own pleadings are to be scrutinized, and the court will notice what would have been had upon a general demurrer.  The variance between the date of the bond declared upon and that produced on oyer is fatal.</p>\n<p>Upon the second point, the Court is of opinion that there is no error in the construction given by the court below to the condition of the bond.  There are many cases on the construction of bonds, where the letter of the condition has been departed from, to carry into effect the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p>But for the first error, the judgment must be reversed and judgment entered for the plaintiff in error on the demurrer.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
