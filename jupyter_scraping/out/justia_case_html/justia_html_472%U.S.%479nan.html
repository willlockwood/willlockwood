Respondent alleged that, while he was being considered for the position of United States Attorney, petitioner </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 472 U. S. 481</a></p><p> wrote two letters to President Reagan. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The complaint alleges that these letters "contained false, slanderous, libelous, inflammatory and derogatory statements" concerning respondent.  App. 4-5.  In particular, the complaint states that the letters falsely accused respondent of "violating the civil rights of various individuals while a Superior Court Judge," "fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud," "extortion or blackmail," and "violations of professional ethics."  <em>Id.</em> at 5-6.  Respondent alleged that petitioner knew that these accusations were false, and that petitioner maliciously intended to injure respondent by undermining his prospect of being appointed United States Attorney.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that petitioner mailed copies of the letters to Presidential Adviser Edwin Meese, Senator Jesse Helms, Representative W. E. Johnston, and three other officials in the Executive and Legislative Branches. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It further alleges that petitioner\'s letters had their intended effect:  respondent was not appointed United States Attorney, his reputation and career as an attorney were injured, and he "suffered humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety and mental anguish."  <em>Id.</em> at 6.  Respondent sought compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million.</p>\n<p>Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.  He then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Petition Clause of the First Amendment provides absolute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 472 U. S. 482</a></p><p> immunity.  The District Court agreed with petitioner that his communications fell "within the general protection afforded by the petition clause," 562 F.Supp. 829, 838-839 (MDNC 1983), but held that the Clause does not grant absolute immunity from liability for libel.  The Fourth Circuit, relying on this Court\'s decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html">White v. Nicholls,</a></span></em> 3 How. 266 (1845), <em>affirmed.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  737 F.2d 427 (1984).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 469 U.S. 1032 (1984), and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The First Amendment guarantees "the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  The right to petition is cut from the same cloth as the other guarantees of that Amendment, and is an assurance of a particular freedom of expression.  In <em>United States v. Cruikshank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/case.html">92 U. S. 542</a></span> (1876), the Court declared that this right is implicit in "[t]he very idea of government, republican in form."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/case.html#552">92 U. S. 552</a></span>.  And James Madison made clear in the congressional debate on the proposed amendment that people "may communicate their will" through direct petitions to the legislature and government officials.  1 Annals of Cong. 738 (1789).</p>\n<p>The historical roots of the Petition Clause long antedate the Constitution.  In 1689, the Bill of Rights exacted of William and Mary stated:  "[I]t is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King."  1 Wm. &amp; Mary, Sess. 2, ch. 2.  This idea reappeared in the Colonies when the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 included a right to petition the King and Parliament in its Declaration of Rights and Grievances.  <em>See</em> 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights -- A Documentary History 198 (1971).  And the Declarations of Rights enacted by many </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 472 U. S. 483</a></p><p> state conventions contained a right to petition for redress of grievances.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights (1776).</p>\n<p>Although the values in the right of petition as an important aspect of self-government are beyond question, it does not follow that the Framers of the First Amendment believed that the Petition Clause provided absolute immunity from damages for libel.  Early libel cases in state courts provide no clear evidence of the nature of the right to petition as it existed at the time the First Amendment was adopted;  these cases reveal conflicting views of the privilege afforded expressions in petitions to government officials.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in the Vermont case of <em>Harris v. Huntington,</em> 2 Tyler 129 (1802), brought a libel action complaining of the defendant\'s petition to the legislature that he not be reappointed as a justice of the peace.  The court, based on its understanding of "the right of petitioning the supreme power," granted the defendant\'s request for an "absolute and unqualified immunity from all responsibility."  <em>Id.</em> at 139-140.  This absolute position of the Vermont court reflected an early English view, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] but was not followed by the courts of other States.  <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Clapp,</em> 4 Mass. 163, 169 (1808).  Indeed, Justice Yeates of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated in <em>Gray v. Pentland,</em> 2 Serg. &amp; R. 23 (1815), that</p>\n<p>"an individual, who <em>maliciously, wantonly,</em> and <em>without probable cause,</em> asperses the character of a public officer in a written or printed paper, delivered to those who are invested with the power of removing him from office, is responsible to the party injured in damages, although such paper is masked under the specious cover of investigating the conduct of such officer for the general good.  Public policy demands no such sacrifice of the rights of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 472 U. S. 484</a></p><p> persons in an official capacity, nor will the law endure such a mockery of its justice."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 25 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>In <em>White v. Nicholls, supra,</em> this Court dealt with the proper common law privilege for petitions to the Government.  The plaintiff in <em>White</em> brought a libel action based on letters written by Nicholls urging the President of the United States to remove the plaintiff from office as a customs inspector.  The Court, after reviewing the common law, concluded that the defendant\'s petition was actionable if prompted by "express malice," which was defined as "falsehood and the absence of probable cause."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html#291">44 U. S. 291</a></span>.  Nothing presented to us suggests that the Court\'s decision not to recognize an absolute privilege in 1845 should be altered; we are not prepared to conclude, 140 years later, that the Framers of the First Amendment understood the right to petition to include an unqualified right to express damaging falsehoods in exercise of that right. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor do the Court\'s decisions interpreting the Petition Clause in contexts other than defamation indicate that the right to petition is absolute.  For example, filing a complaint in court is a form of petitioning activity; but "baseless litigation is not immunized by the First Amendment right to petition."  <em>Bill Johnson\'s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/731/case.html">461 U. S. 731</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/731/case.html#743">461 U.

Similarly, petitions to the President that contain intentional and reckless falsehoods "do not enjoy constitutional protection," <em>Garrison v.

S. 485</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To accept petitioner\'s claim of absolute immunity would elevate the Petition Clause to special First Amendment status.  The Petition Clause, however, was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak, publish, and assemble.  <em>See Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/217/case.html">389 U.

Belk,</em> 34 N.C.App. 488, 490, 238 S.E.2d 788, 789 (1977).  We hold that the Petition Clause does not require the State to expand this privilege into an absolute one.  The right to petition is guaranteed;  the right to commit libel with impunity is not.

For the use of the known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected.  Calculated falsehood falls into that class of utterances which"</p>\n<p>"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>Chaplinsky v.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  First, he contends that petitioning historically was accorded an absolute immunity and that the Framers included the Petition Clause in the First Amendment on this understanding.  I agree with the Court that the evidence concerning 17th- and 18th-century British and colonial practice reveals, at most, "conflicting views of the privilege afforded expressions in petitions to government officials," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/472/479/case.html#483">472 U. S. 483</a></span>, and does not persuasively demonstrate the Framers\' intent to accord absolute immunity to petitioning.</p>\n<p>Second, McDonald argues that criticism of public officials under the Petition Clause is functionally different from, and therefore entitled to greater protection than, criticism of officials falling within the protection of the First Amendment\'s Speech and Press Clauses.  Specifically, he contends that</p>\n<p>"<em>[u]nlike the more general freedoms of speech and press,</em> the right to petition was understood by the Framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment to be a necessary right of a self-governing people,"</p>\n<p>and that</p>\n<p>"when the citizen is not speaking to the public at large, but is directly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 472 U. S. 489</a></p><p> exercising his right to petition, [he] is thus performing a self-governmental function."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioner 7, 30 (emphasis added).  Such a distinction is untenable.  The Speech and Press Clauses, every bit as much as the Petition Clause, were included in the First Amendment to ensure the growth and preservation of democratic self-governance.  A citizen who criticizes a public official is shielded by the Speech and Press Clauses because "[i]t is as much his <em>duty</em> to criticize as it is the official\'s duty to administer."  <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> 376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#282">376 U. S. 282</a></span> (emphasis added).  "[S]peech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government."  <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/64/case.html#74">379 U. S. 74</a></span>-75. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Framers envisioned the rights of speech, press, assembly, and petitioning as interrelated components of the public\'s exercise of its sovereign authority.  As Representative James Madison observed during the House of Representatives\' consideration of the First Amendment:</p>\n<p>"The right of freedom of speech is secured; the liberty of the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of this Government; the people may therefore publicly address their representatives, may privately advise them, or declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body;  <em>in all these ways they may communicate their will.</em>"</p>\n<p>1 Annals of Cong. 738 (1789) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Court previously has emphasized the essential unity of the First Amendment\'s guarantees:</p>\n<p>"It was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 472 U. S. 490</a></p><p> guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances.  All these, though not identical, are inseparable.  They are cognate rights, . . . and therefore are united in the First Article\'s assurance."</p>\n<p><em>Thomas v.

And although we have not previously addressed the precise issue before us today, we have recurrently treated the right to petition similarly to, and frequently as overlapping with, the First Amendment\'s other guarantees of free expression.  <em>See, e.g., NAACP v.

It necessarily follows that expression falling within the scope of the Petition Clause, while fully protected by the actual-malice standard set forth in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> is not shielded by an absolute privilege.  I therefore join the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>To safeguard the First Amendment\'s values, "defeasance of the privilege" set forth in <em>New York Times</em> "is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth."  <em>Garrison v.

Brief for Petitioner 7, and n. 7.  The Court long ago concluded, however, that the Petition Clause embraces a much broader range of communications addressed to the executive, the legislature, courts, and administrative agencies.  <em>See, e.g., Bill Johnson\'s Restaurants, Inc. v.
