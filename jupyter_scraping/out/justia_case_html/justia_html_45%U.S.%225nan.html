The cause was tried at May term, 1843, when the jury, under the direction of the court, found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Bill of Exceptions tendered by the Defendants</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, and while the same was before the jury, the said plaintiffs, by their counsel, to maintain and prove the said issue on their part, gave in evidence and proved that one Adam Bower (now deceased), in his lifetime, previous to the year 1833, was seized in fee of a certain lot or parcel of land in the said declaration, and hereinafter described.  That on 16 April, 1833 the said Adam Bower, being so seized of said land, died, leaving three daughters, to-wit, Martha Phipps, wife of William M. Phipps; Mary Haile, wife of William R.

Phipps and William R. Haile have both departed this life, and that since the death of the said William R. Haile, Mary Haile, his widow, has intermarried with Charles Rice one of the plaintiffs.

Holton contracted with the said heirs and their husbands aforesaid for the sale and purchase of the said lands, and in consideration that the said heirs would make and insure to them a good and valid title in fee simple to the said land, they agreed to give and pay to the said heirs for the same the sum of $40,000; $5,000 whereof should be paid in hand on the delivery of possession, and the residue should be secured to be paid in installments, to be specified, in promissory notes, to be executed by the said Holton and endorsed by the said Barlow, and by a mortgage on the said land.  That the said Holton and Barlow, in pursuance of the said contract, paid the said $5,000 to the said heirs, and delivered to them twelve promissory notes for $2,916.66 1/3 each, all bearing date 16 of April, 1835, and payable as follows:  three of said notes in twelve months, three others in two years, three others in three years, and the other three in four years from the date thereof, and made by the said Henry S.

That at the time of the marriage of the said Mary Haile with the said Charles Rice in the year 1838, said Holton and Barlow were in quiet and peaceable possession of the said land and ignorant of any objection to their title.  That the buildings on said land at the time of the purchase having been destroyed by fire, the said Holton and Barlow rebuilt the same at an expense of $100,000, which improvements were made with the full knowledge of said heirs, and without any objection on their part.

The said judge did then and there declare and deliver his opinion, that the objection, so taken by the said counsel for the said plaintiffs, ought to be allowed; that the said bond and the said deed ought not to be admitted in evidence, and did accordingly decide that the same should not be read in evidence on the part of the said defendants; to which said opinion of the said judge, the said counsel for the said defendants did then and there, in due form of law, except, before the jury retired from their box, and prayed that the said exceptions might be signed, and sealed, and made a part of the record.

That at the time of the marriage of the said Mary Haile with the said Charles Rice in the year 1838, said Holton and Barlow were in quiet and peaceable possession of the said land and ignorant of any objection to their title.  That the buildings on said land at the time of the purchase having been destroyed by fire, the said Holton and Barlow rebuilt the same at an expense of $100,000, which improvements were made with the full knowledge of said heirs, and without any objection on their part.  And that the said Martha Phipps and Mary Haile, now Mary Rice, by accepting and receiving payments of money from the said Holton and Barlow upon the said notes and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 45 U.

The said judge did then and there declare and deliver his opinion, that the objection, so taken by the said counsel for the said plaintiffs, ought to be allowed; that the said bond and the said deed ought not to be admitted in evidence, and did accordingly decide that the same should not be read in evidence on the part of the said defendants; to which said opinion of the said judge, the said counsel for the said defendants did then and there, in due form of law, except, before the jury retired from their box, and prayed that the said exceptions might be signed, and sealed, and made a part of the record.

S. 232</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To review this decision of the court below, the case was brought up to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 45 U. S. 241</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This being an action of ejectment, the only question between the parties is upon the legal title.</p>\n<p>It is admitted in the exception, that Mary Rice and Martha Phipps, lessors of the plaintiff, were each of them, as heirs at law of Adam Bower, entitled to an undivided third part of the premises mentioned in the declaration, in fee simple.  In order to show title out of them, the plaintiffs in error relied upon the bond of conveyance and deed, mentioned in the statement of the case, both of which were signed and sealed by these lessors of the plaintiff, but were executed while they were <em>femes covert.</em></p>\n<p>As regards the bond, it would not have transferred the legal title, even if all the parties had been capable of entering into a valid and binding agreement.  But as to the <em>femes covert</em> who signed it, it was merely void, and conferred no right, legal or equitable, upon the obligees.</p>\n<p>The deed, also, is inoperative as to their title to the land.  In the premises of this instrument, it is stated to be the indenture of their respective husbands in right of their wives, of the one part, and of the grantees, of the other part -- the husbands and the grantees being specifically named, and the parties of the first part there grant and convey to the parties of the second part.  The lessors of the plaintiff are not described as grantors, and they use no words to convey their interest.  It is altogether the act of the husbands, and they alone convey.  Now in order to convey by grant, the party possessing the right must be the grantor, and use apt and proper words to convey to the grantee, and merely signing and sealing and acknowledging an instrument, in which another person is grantor, is not sufficient.  The deed in question conveyed the marital interest of the husbands in these lands, but nothing more. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 45 U. S. 242</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to inquire whether the acknowledgment of the <em>femes covert</em> is or is not in conformity with the statute of Mississippi.  For, assuming it to be entirely regular, it would not give effect to the conveyance of their interests made by the husbands alone.  And as to the receipt of the money mentioned in the testimony, after they became sole, it certainly could not operate as a legal conveyance, passing the estate to the grantee, nor give effect to a deed which as to them was utterly void.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the circuit court is therefore affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
