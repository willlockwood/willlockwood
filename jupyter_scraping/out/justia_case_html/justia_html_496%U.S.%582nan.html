The officer administering the breathalyzer test also carefully limited her role to providing Muniz with relevant information about the test and the implied consent law.

S. 585</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>During the early morning hours of November 30, 1986, a patrol officer spotted respondent Inocencio Muniz and a passenger parked in a car on the shoulder of a highway.  When the officer inquired whether Muniz needed assistance, Muniz replied that he had stopped the car so he could urinate.  The officer smelled alcohol on Muniz\'s breath and observed that Muniz\'s eyes were glazed and bloodshot and his face was flushed.  The officer then directed Muniz to remain parked until his condition improved, and Muniz gave assurances that he would do so.  But as the officer returned to his vehicle, Muniz drove off.  After the officer pursued Muniz down the highway and pulled him over, the officer asked Muniz to perform three standard field sobriety tests:  a "horizontal gaze nystagmus" test, a "walk and turn" test, and a "one leg stand" test. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Muniz performed these tests poorly, and he informed the officer that he had failed the tests because he had been drinking.</p>\n<p>The patrol officer arrested Muniz and transported him to the West Shore facility of the Cumberland County Central Booking Center.  Following its routine practice for receiving persons suspected of driving while intoxicated, the Booking Center\' videotaped the ensuing proceedings.  Muniz was informed that his actions and voice were being recorded, but he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 496 U. S. 586</a></p><p> was not at this time (nor had he been previously) advised of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966).  Officer Hosterman first asked Muniz his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age.  He responded to each of these questions, stumbling over his address and age.  The officer then asked Muniz, "Do you know what the date was of your sixth birthday?"  After Muniz offered an inaudible reply, the officer repeated, "When you turned six years old, do you remember what the date was?"  Muniz responded, "No, I don\'t."</p>\n<p>Officer Hosterman next requested Muniz to perform each of the three sobriety tests that Muniz had been asked to perform earlier during the initial roadside stop.  The videotape reveals that his eyes jerked noticeably during the gaze test, that he did not walk a very straight line, and that he could not balance himself on one leg for more than several seconds.  During the latter two tests, he did not complete the requested verbal counts from one to nine and from one to thirty.  Moreover, while performing these tests, Muniz "attempted to explain his difficulties in performing the various tasks, and often requested further clarification of the tasks he was to perform."  377 Pa.Super. 382, 390, 547 A.2d 419, 423 (1988).</p>\n<p>Finally, Officer Deyo asked Muniz to submit to a breathalyzer test designed to measure the alcohol content of his expelled breath.  Officer Deyo read to Muniz the Commonwealth\'s Implied Consent Law, 75 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1547 (1987), and explained that, under the law, his refusal to take the test would result in automatic suspension of his drivers\' license for one year.  Muniz asked a number of questions about the law, commenting in the process about his state of inebriation.  Muniz ultimately refused to take the breath test.  At this point, Muniz was for the first time advised of his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Muniz then signed a statement waiving his rights and admitted in response to further questioning that he had been driving while intoxicated. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="587">Page 496 U. S. 587</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Both the video and audio portions of the videotape were admitted into evidence at Muniz\' bench trial, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] along with the arresting officer\'s testimony that Muniz failed the roadside sobriety tests and made incriminating remarks at that time.  Muniz was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 3731(a)(1) (1987).  Muniz filed a motion for a new trial, contending that the court should have excluded the testimony relating to the field sobriety tests and the videotape taken at the Booking Center "because they were incriminating and completed prior to [Muniz\'s] receiving his <em>Miranda</em> warnings."  App. to Pet. for Cert. C5-C6.  The trial court denied the motion, holding that</p>\n<p>"requesting a driver, suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol, to perform physical tests or take a breath analysis does not violate [his] privilege against self-incrimination because [the] evidence procured is of a physical nature rather than testimonial, and therefore no <em>Miranda</em> warnings are required."</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at C6, quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Benson,</em> 280 Pa.Super. 20, 29, 421 A.2d 383, 387 (1980).</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania reversed.  The appellate court agreed that when Muniz was asked "to submit to a field sobriety test, and later perform these tests before the videotape camera, no <em>Miranda</em> warnings were required" because such sobriety tests elicit physical rather than testimonial evidence within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  377 Pa.Super. at 387, 547 A.2d at 422.  The court concluded, however, that</p>\n<p>"when the physical nature of the tests begins to yield testimonial and communicative statements . . . the protections afforded by <em>Miranda</em> are invoked."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The court explained that Muniz\'s answer to the question regarding his sixth birthday and the statements and inquiries he made while performing the physical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 496 U. S. 588</a></p><p> dexterity tests and discussing the breathalyzer test "are precisely the sort of testimonial evidence that we expressly protected in [previous cases]," <em>id.</em> at 390, 547 A.2d at 423, because they "reveal[ed] his thought processes."  <em>Id.</em> at 389, 547 A.2d at 423.  The court further explained:</p>\n<p>"[N]one of Muniz\'s utterances were spontaneous, voluntary verbalizations.  Rather, they were clearly compelled by the questions and instructions presented to him during his detention at the Booking Center.  Since the . . . responses and communications were elicited before Muniz received his <em>Miranda</em> warnings, they should have been excluded as evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 390, 547 A.2d at 423. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Concluding that the audio portion of the videotape should have been suppressed in its entirety, the court reversed Muniz\'s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.

S. 590</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case implicates both the "testimonial" and "compulsion" components of the privilege against self-incrimination in the context of pretrial questioning.  Because Muniz was not advised of his <em>Miranda</em> rights until after the videotaped proceedings at the Booking Center were completed, any verbal statements that were both testimonial in nature and elicited during custodial interrogation should have been suppressed.  We focus first on Muniz\'s responses to the initial informational questions, then on his questions and utterances while performing the physical dexterity and balancing tests, and finally on his questions and utterances surrounding the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the initial phase of the recorded proceedings, Officer Hosterman asked Muniz his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, current age, and the date of his sixth birthday.  Both the delivery and content of Muniz\'s answers were incriminating.  As the state court found,</p>\n<p>"Muniz\'s videotaped responses . . . certainly led the finder of fact to infer that his confusion and failure to speak clearly indicated a state of drunkenness that prohibited him from safely operating his vehicle."</p>\n<p>377 Pa.Super. at 390, 547 A.2d at 423.  The Commonwealth argues, however, that admission of Muniz\'s answers to these questions does not contravene Fifth Amendment principles because Muniz\'s statement regarding his sixth birthday was not "testimonial" and his answers to the prior questions were not elicited by custodial interrogation.  We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We agree with the Commonwealth\'s contention that Muniz\'s answers are not rendered inadmissible by <em>Miranda</em> merely because the slurred nature of his speech was incriminating.  The physical inability to articulate words in a clear manner due to "the lack of muscular coordination of his tongue and mouth," Brief for Petitioner 16, is not itself a testimonial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="591">Page 496 U. S. 591</a></p><p> component of Muniz\'s responses to Officer Hosterman\'s introductory questions.  In <em>Schmerber v. California, supra,</em> we drew a distinction between "testimonial" and "real or physical evidence" for purposes of the privilege against self-incrimination.  We noted that, in <em>Holt v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/218/245/case.html">218 U. S. 245</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/218/245/case.html#252">218 U. S. 252</a></span>-253 (1910), Justice Holmes had written for the Court that</p>\n<p>"[t]he prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html#763">384 U. S. 763</a></span>.  We also acknowledged that</p>\n<p>"both federal and state courts have usually held that it offers no protection against compulsion to submit to fingerprinting, photographing, or measurements, to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html#764">384 U. S. 764</a></span>.  Embracing this view of the privilege\'s contours, we held that</p>\n<p>"the privilege is a bar against compelling \'communications\' or \'testimony,\' but that compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \'real or physical evidence\' does not violate it."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Using this "helpful framework for analysis," <em>ibid.,</em> we held that a person suspected of driving while intoxicated could be forced to provide a blood sample, because that sample was "real or physical evidence" outside the scope of the privilege and the sample was obtained in manner by which "[p]etitioner\'s testimonial capacities were in no way implicated."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html#765">384 U. S. 765</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We have since applied the distinction between "real or physical" and "testimonial" evidence in other contexts where the evidence could be produced only through some volitional act on the part of the suspect.  In <em>United States v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html">388 U. S. 218</a></span> (1967), we held that a suspect could be compelled to participate in a lineup and to repeat a phrase provided by the police so that witnesses could view him and listen to his voice.  We explained that requiring his presence and speech at a lineup reflected "compulsion of the accused to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="592">Page 496 U.

S. 1</a></span> (1973), we held that suspects could be compelled to read a transcript in order to provide a voice exemplar, explaining that the</p>\n<p>"voice recordings were to be used solely to measure the physical properties of the witnesses\' voices, not for the testimonial or communicative content of what was to be said."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/1/case.html#7">410 U.

Requiring a suspect to reveal the physical manner in which he articulates words, like requiring him to reveal the physical properties of the sound produced by his voice, <em>see Dionisio, supra,</em> does not, without more, compel him to provide a "testimonial" response for purposes of the privilege.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>This does not end our inquiry, for Muniz\'s answer to the sixth birthday question was incriminating, not just because of his delivery, but also because of his answer\'s content; the trier of fact could infer from Muniz\'s answer (that he did not know the proper date) that his mental state was confused. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="593">Page 496 U. S. 593</a></p><p> The Commonwealth and United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argue that this incriminating inference does not trigger the protections of the Fifth Amendment privilege because the inference concerns "the physiological functioning of [Muniz\'s] brain," Brief for Petitioner 21, which is asserted to be every bit as "real or physical" as the physiological makeup of his blood and the timbre of his voice.</p>\n<p>But this characterization addresses the wrong question; that the "fact" to be inferred might be said to concern the physical status of Muniz\'s brain merely describes the way in which the inference is incriminating.  The correct question for present purposes is whether the incriminating inference of mental confusion is drawn from a testimonial act or from physical evidence.  In <em>Schmerber,</em> for example, we held that the police could compel a suspect to provide a blood sample in order to determine the physical makeup of his blood, and thereby draw an inference about whether he was intoxicated.  This compulsion was outside of the Fifth Amendment\'s protection, not simply because the evidence concerned the suspect\'s physical body, but rather because the evidence was obtained in a manner that did not entail any testimonial act on the part of the suspect:</p>\n<p>"[n]ot even a shadow of testimonial compulsion upon or enforced communication by the accused was involved either in the extraction or in the chemical analysis."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html#765">384 U. S. 765</a></span>.  In contrast, had the police instead asked the suspect directly whether his blood contained a high concentration of alcohol, his affirmative response would have been testimonial even though it would have been used to draw the same inference concerning his physiology.  <em>See ibid.</em> ("[T]he blood test evidence . . . was neither [suspect\'s] testimony nor evidence relating to some communicative act").  In this case, the question is not whether a suspect\'s "impaired mental faculties" can fairly be characterized as an aspect of his physiology, but rather whether Muniz\'s response </p><p><a class="page-number" name="594">Page 496 U.

The major thrust of the policies undergirding the privilege is to prevent such compulsion."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#212">487 U.

At its core, the privilege reflects our fierce "<em>unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt,\'"  <em>Doe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#212">487 U.

Because the privilege was designed primarily to prevent "a recurrence of the Inquisition and the Star Chamber, even if not in their stark brutality," <em>Ullmann v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/422/case.html">350 U.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Whatever </p><p><a class="page-number" name="597">Page 496 U. S. 597</a></p><p> else it may include, therefore, the definition of "testimonial" evidence articulated in <em>Doe</em> must encompass all responses to questions that, if asked of a sworn suspect during a criminal trial, could place the suspect in the "cruel trilemma."  This conclusion is consistent with our recognition in <em>Doe</em> that "[t]he vast majority of verbal statements thus will be testimonial" because "[t]here are very few instances in which a verbal statement, either oral or written, will not convey information or assert facts."  487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#213">487 U. S. 213</a></span>.  Whenever a suspect is asked for a response requiring him to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the suspect confronts the "trilemma" of truth, falsity, or silence, and hence the response (whether based on truth or falsity) contains a testimonial component.</p>\n<p>This approach accords with each of our post-<em>Schmerber</em> cases finding that a particular oral or written response to express or implied questioning was nontestimonial; the questions presented in these cases did not confront the suspects with this trilemma.  As we noted in <em>Doe,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#210">487 U. S. 210</a></span>-211, the cases upholding compelled writing and voice exemplars did not involve situations in which suspects were asked to communicate any personal beliefs or knowledge of facts, and therefore the suspects were not forced to choose between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="598">Page 496 U. S. 598</a></p><p> truthfully or falsely revealing their thoughts.  We carefully noted in <em>Gilbert v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html">388 U. S. 263</a></span> (1967), for example, that a</p>\n<p>"mere handwriting exemplar, <em>in contrast to the content of what is written,</em> like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside [the privilege\'s] protection."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html#266">388 U.

Had the suspect been asked to provide a writing sample of his own composition, the content of the writing would have reflected his assertion of facts or beliefs, and hence would have been testimonial; but in <em>Gilbert,</em> "[n]o claim [was] made that the content of the exemplars was testimonial or communicative matter."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html#267">388 U. S. 267</a></span>. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  And in <em>Doe,</em> the suspect was asked merely to sign a consent form waiving a privacy interest in foreign bank records.  Because the consent form spoke in the hypothetical and did not identify any particular banks, accounts, or private records, the form neither "communicate[d] any factual assertions, implicit or explicit, [n]or convey[ed] any information to the Government."  487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/201/case.html#215">487 U.

S. 599</a></p><p> asked Muniz if he knew the date of his sixth birthday and Muniz, for whatever reason, could not remember or calculate that date, he was confronted with the trilemma.  By hypothesis, the inherently coercive environment created by the custodial interrogation precluded the option of remaining silent, <em>see</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  Muniz was left with the choice of incriminating himself by admitting that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday or answering untruthfully by reporting a date that he did not then believe to be accurate (an incorrect guess would be incriminating as well as untruthful).  The content of his truthful answer supported an inference that his mental faculties were impaired, because his assertion (he did not know the date of his sixth birthday) was different from the assertion (he knew the date was [correct date]) that the trier of fact might reasonably have expected a lucid person to provide.  Hence, the incriminating inference of impaired mental faculties stemmed, not just from the fact that Muniz slurred his response, but also from a testimonial aspect of that response.

Therefore, because we conclude that Muniz\'s response to the sixth birthday question was testimonial, the response should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that the seven questions asked by Officer Hosterman just prior to the sixth birthday question -- regarding Muniz\'s name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age -- did not constitute custodial interrogation as we have defined the term in <em>Miranda</em> and subsequent cases.

Thus, custodial interrogation for purposes of <em>Miranda</em> includes both express questioning and also words or actions that, given the officer\'s knowledge of any special susceptibilities of the suspect, the officer knows or reasonably should know are likely to "have . . . the force of a question on the accused,"  <em>Harryman v. Estelle,</em> 616 F.2d 870, 874 (CA5 1980), and therefore be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n<p>We disagree with the Commonwealth\'s contention that Officer Hosterman\'s first seven questions regarding Muniz\'s name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age do not qualify as custodial interrogation as we defined the term in <em>Innis, supra,</em> merely because the questions were not intended to elicit information for investigatory purposes.  As explained above, the <em>Innis</em> test focuses primarily upon "the perspective of the suspect."  <em>Perkins, ante,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/292/case.html#296">496 U.

We agree with <em>amicus</em> United States, however, that Muniz\'s answers to these first seven questions are nonetheless admissible because the questions fall within a "routine booking question" exception which exempts from <em>Miranda\'s</em> coverage questions to secure the "biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services."  Brief for the United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12, quoting <em>United States v. Horton,</em> 873 F.2d 180, 181, n. 2 (CA8 1989).  The state court found that the first seven questions were "requested for recordkeeping purposes only," App. B16, and therefore the questions appear reasonably related to the police\'s administrative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="602">Page 496 U.

[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In this context, therefore, the first seven questions asked at the Booking Center fall outside the protections of <em>Miranda</em> and the answers thereto need not be suppressed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>During the second phase of the videotaped proceedings, Officer Hosterman asked Muniz to perform the same three sobriety tests that he had earlier performed at roadside prior to his arrest:  the "horizontal gaze nystagmus" test, the "walk and turn" test, and the "one leg stand" test.  While Muniz was attempting to comprehend Officer Hosterman\'s instructions and then perform the requested sobriety tests, Muniz made several audible and incriminating statements. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Muniz argued to the state court that both the videotaped performance of the physical tests themselves and the audiorecorded verbal statements were introduced in violation of <em>Miranda</em>.</p>\n<p>The court refused to suppress the videotaped evidence of Muniz\'s paltry performance on the physical sobriety tests, reasoning that</p>\n<p>"[r]equiring a driver to perform physical [sobriety] tests . . . does not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because the evidence procured is of a physical nature rather than testimonial."</p>\n<p>377 Pa.Super. at 387, 547 A.2d at 422 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  With respect to Muniz\'s verbal statements, however, the court concluded that "none of Muniz\'s utterances were spontaneous, voluntary verbalizations," 377 Pa.Super. at 390, 547 A.2d at 423, and because they were "elicited before Muniz received his <em>Miranda</em> warnings, they should have been excluded as evidence."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We disagree.  Officer Hosterman\'s dialogue with Muniz concerning the physical sobriety tests consisted primarily of carefully scripted instructions as to how the tests were to be performed.  These instructions were not likely to be perceived as calling for any verbal response, and therefore were not "words or actions" constituting custodial interrogation, with two narrow exceptions not relevant here. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The dialogue also contained limited and carefully worded inquiries as to whether Muniz understood those instructions, but these focused inquiries were necessarily "attendant to" the police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="604">Page 496 U. S. 604</a></p><p> procedure held by the court to be legitimate.  Hence, Muniz\'s incriminating utterances during this phase of the videotaped proceedings were "voluntary" in the sense that they were not elicited in response to custodial interrogation.

Officer Deyo read Muniz a prepared script explaining how the test worked, the nature of Pennsylvania\'s Implied Consent Law, and the legal consequences that would ensue should he refuse.  Officer Deyo then asked Muniz whether he understood the nature of the test and the law and whether he would like to submit to the test.

I. R. Erwin <em>et al.,</em> Defense of Drunk Driving Cases \xc2\xa7 8A.99, pp. 8A-43, 8A-45 (1989).  The "walk and turn" test requires the subject to walk heel-to-toe along a straight line for nine paces, pivot, and then walk back heel-to-toe along the line for another nine paces.  The subject is required to count each pace aloud from one to nine.

Indeed, had the question related only to the date of his birth, it presumably would have come under the "booking exception" to <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), to which the Court refers elsewhere in its opinion.  The Court holds in this very case that Muniz may be required to perform a "horizontal gaze nystagmus" test, the "walk and turn" test, and the "one leg stand" test, all of which are designed to test a suspect\'s physical coordination.  If the police may require Muniz to use his body in order to demonstrate the level of his physical coordination, there is no reason why they should not be able to require him to speak or write in order to determine his mental coordination.  That was all that was sought here.  Since it was permissible for the police to extract and examine a sample of Schmerber\'s blood to determine how much that part of his system had been affected by alcohol, I see no reason why they may not examine the functioning of Muniz\'s mental processes for the same purpose. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="608">Page 496 U. S. 608</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Surely, if it were relevant, a suspect might be asked to take an eye examination in the course of which he might have to admit that he could not read the letters on the third line of the chart.  At worst, he might utter a mistaken guess.  Muniz likewise might have attempted to guess the correct response to the sixth birthday question instead of attempting to calculate the date or answer "I don\'t know."  But the potential for giving a bad guess does not subject the suspect to the truth-falsity-silence predicament that renders a response testimonial and, therefore, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p>For substantially the same reasons, Muniz\'s responses to the videotaped "booking" questions were not testimonial and do not warrant application of the privilege.  Thus, it is unnecessary to determine whether the questions fall within the "routine booking question" exception to <em>Miranda</em> JUSTICE BRENNAN recognizes.</p>\n<p>I would reverse in its entirety the judgment of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.  But given the fact that five members of the Court agree that Muniz\'s response to the sixth birthday question should have been suppressed, I agree that the judgment of the Superior Court should be vacated so that, on remand, the court may consider whether admission of the response at trial was harmless error.</p>\n<p>Justice MARSHALL, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I concur in Part III-B of the Court\'s opinion that the "sixth birthday question" required a testimonial response from respondent Muniz.  For the reasons discussed below, <em>see infra,</em> at ___, n. 1, that question constituted custodial interrogation.  Because the police did not apprise Muniz of his <em>Miranda</em> rights before asking the question, his response should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p>I disagree, however, with the plurality\'s recognition in Part III-C of a "routine booking question" exception to <em>Miranda.</em>  Moreover, even were such an exception warranted, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="609">Page 496 U. S. 609</a></p><p> it should not extend to booking questions that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses.  Because the police in this case should have known that the seven booking questions were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses, and because those questions were not preceded by <em>Miranda</em> warnings, Muniz\'s testimonial responses should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the Court\'s holding in Part IV that Muniz\'s testimonial statements in connection with the three sobriety tests and the breathalyzer test were not the products of custodial interrogation.  The police should have known that the circumstances in which they confronted Muniz, combined with the detailed instructions and questions concerning the tests and the State\'s Implied Consent Law, were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, and therefore constituted the "functional equivalent" of express questioning.  <em>Rhode Island v.

Muniz\'s statements to the police in connection with these tests thus should have been suppressed because he was not first given the <em>Miranda</em> warnings.</p>\n<p>Finally, the officer\'s directions to Muniz to count aloud during two of the sobriety tests sought testimonial responses, and Muniz\'s responses were incriminating.

The plurality\'s position, were it adopted by a majority of the Court, would necessitate difficult, time-consuming litigation over whether particular questions asked during booking are "routine," whether they are necessary to secure biographical information, whether that information is itself necessary for recordkeeping purposes, and whether the questions are -- despite their routine nature -- designed to elicit incriminating testimony.

Although the police\'s intent to obtain an incriminating response is relevant to this inquiry, the key components of the analysis are the nature of the questioning, the attendant circumstances, and the perceptions of the suspect. <em>Cf. id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#301">446 U.

Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, Muniz did in fact "stumbl[e] over his address and age," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#586">496 U.

Moreover, the very fact that, after a suspect has been arrested for driving under the influence, the Pennsylvania police regularly videotape the subsequent questioning strongly implies a purpose to the interrogation other than "recordkeeping."  The seven questions in this case, then, do not fall within the routine booking question exception even under the majority\'s standard.

The booking questions, like the sixth birthday question, required Muniz to (1) answer correctly, indicating lucidity, (2) answer incorrectly, implying that his mental faculties were impaired, or (3) state that he did not know the answer, also indicating impairment.  Muniz\'s initial incorrect response to the question about his age and his inability to give his address without looking at his license, like his inability to answer the sixth birthday question, in fact gave rise to the incriminating inference that his mental faculties were impaired.  Accordingly, because the police did not inform Muniz of his <em>Miranda</em> rights before asking the booking questions, his responses should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court finds in Part IV of its opinion that <em>Miranda</em> is inapplicable to Muniz\'s statements made in connection with the three sobriety tests and the breathalyzer examination because those statements (which were undoubtedly testimonial) were not the products of "custodial interrogation."  In my view, however, the circumstances of this case -- in particular, Muniz\'s apparent intoxication -- rendered the officers\' words and actions the "functional equivalent" of express questioning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 496 U. S. 613</a></p><p> because the police should have known that their conduct was "reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response."  <em>Innis, supra,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#301">446 U.

S. 602</a></span>-604, Officer Hosterman instructed Muniz how to perform the sobriety tests, inquired whether Muniz understood the instructions, and then directed Muniz to perform the tests.  Officer Deyo later explained the breathalyzer examination and the nature of the State\'s Implied Consent Law, and asked several times if Muniz understood the Law and wanted to take the examination.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#604">496 U. S. 604</a></span>.  Although these words and actions might not prompt most sober persons to volunteer incriminating statements, Officers Hosterman and Deyo had good reason to believe -- from the arresting officer\'s observations, App. 13-19 (testimony of Officer Spotts), from Muniz\'s failure of the three roadside sobriety tests, <em>id.</em> at 19, and from their own observations -- that Muniz was intoxicated.  The officers thus should have known that Muniz was reasonably likely to have trouble understanding their instructions and their explanation of the Implied Consent Law, and that he was reasonably likely to indicate, in response to their questions, that he did not understand the tests or the Law.  Moreover, because Muniz made several incriminating statements regarding his intoxication during and after the roadside tests, <em>id.</em> at 20-21, the police should have known that the same tests at the Booking Center were reasonably likely to prompt similar incriminating statements.</p>\n<p>The Court today, however, completely ignores Muniz\'s condition and focuses solely on the nature of the officers\' words and actions.  As the Court held in <em>Innis,</em> however, the focus in the "functional equivalent" inquiry is on "the perceptions of the suspect," not on the officers\' conduct viewed in isolation.  446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#301">446 U.

Muniz\'s apparent intoxication, then, and the police\'s knowledge of his statements during and after the roadside tests compel the conclusion that the police should have known that their words and actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. [<a href="#F1/2" name="T1/2">Footnote 1/2</a>]  Muniz\'s statements were thus the product of custodial interrogation and should have been suppressed because Muniz was not first given the <em>Miranda</em> warnings.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court concedes that Officer Hosterman\'s directions that Muniz count aloud to 9 while performing the "walk-the-line" test and to 30 while performing the "one-leg-stand" test constituted custodial interrogation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#603">496 U.

Also indisputable is the testimonial nature of the responses sought by those directions; the content of Muniz\'s counting, just like his answers to the sixth birthday and the booking questions, would provide the basis for an inference regarding his state of mind.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#599">496 U.

The Court finds the admission at trial of Muniz\'s responses permissible, however, because they were not incriminating "except to the extent [they] exhibited a tendency to slur words, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 496 U.

First, as a factual matter, Muniz\'s responses <em>were</em> incriminating for a reason other than his apparent slurring.  Muniz did not count at all during the walk-the-line test, supporting the inference that he was unable to do so. [<a href="#F1/3" name="T1/3">Footnote 1/3</a>]  And, contrary to the Court\'s assertion, <em>ibid.</em> during the one-leg-stand test, Muniz incorrectly counted in Spanish from one to six, skipping the number two.  Even if Muniz had not skipped "two," his failure to complete the count was incriminating in itself.</p>\n<p>Second, and more importantly, Muniz\'s responses would have been "incriminating" for purposes of <em>Miranda</em> even if he had fully and accurately counted aloud during the two tests.

Similarly, for precisely the same reason, no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely `exculpatory\'").

Because Muniz did not receive the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, then, his responses should have been suppressed.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>All of Muniz\'s responses during the videotaped session were prompted by questions that sought testimonial answers during the course of custodial interrogation.  Because the police did not read Muniz the <em>Miranda</em> warnings before he gave those responses, the responses should have been suppressed.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the state court. [<a href="#F1/4" name="T1/4">Footnote 1/4</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1/1" name="F1/1">Footnote 1/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The sixth birthday question also clearly constituted custodial interrogation because it was a form of "express questioning."  <em>Rhode Island v. Innis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html">446 U. S. 291</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/291/case.html#300">446 U. S. 300</a></span>-301 (1980).  Furthermore, that question would not fall within the plurality\'s proposed routine booking question exception.  The question serves no apparent recordkeeping need, as the police already possessed Muniz\'s date of birth.  The absence of any administrative need for the question, moreover, suggests that the question was designed to obtain an incriminating response.  Regardless of any administrative need for the question and regardless of the officer\'s intent, <em>Miranda</em> warnings were required because the police should have known that the question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.  <em>Supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#610">496 U. S. 610</a></span>-611.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1/2" name="F1/2">Footnote 1/2</a>]</p>\n<p>An additional factor strongly suggests that the police expected Muniz to make incriminating statements.  Pursuant to their routine in such cases, App. 28-29, the police allotted 20 minutes for the three sobriety tests and for "observation."  Because Muniz finished the tests in approximately 6 minutes, the police required him to wait another 14 minutes before they asked him to submit to the breathalyzer examination.  Given the absence of any apparent technical or administrative reason for the delay and the stated purpose of "observing" Muniz, the delay appears to have been designed in part to give Muniz the opportunity to make incriminating statements.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1/3" name="F1/3">Footnote 1/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth could not use Muniz\'s failure to count against him regardless of whether his silence during the walk-the-line test was itself testimonial in those circumstances.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#603">496 U.

A defendant\'s silence in response to police questioning is not admissible at trial, even if the silence is not, in the particular circumstances, a form of communicative conduct.  <em>Miranda v.

Of course, a person\'s refusal to incriminate himself also cannot be used against him.  <em>See</em> <l=|496 3|="" 582fn1="" u.s.="">n. 3, <em>supra.</em>  Muniz\'s performance of the sobriety tests and his refusal to take the breathalyzer examination are thus protected by the Fifth Amendment under this interpretation.  <em>But cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/582/case.html#604">496 U.
