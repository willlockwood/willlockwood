Wireless carriers collect and store this information for their own business purposes.  Here, after the FBI identified the cell phone numbers of several robbery suspects, prosecutors were granted court orders to obtain the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 cell phone records under the Stored Communications Act.  Wireless carriers produced CSLI for petitioner Timothy Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s phone, and the Government was able to obtain 12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s movements over 127 days\xe2\x80\x94an average of 101 data points per day.  Carpenter moved to suppress the data, arguing that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s seizure of the records without obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause violated the\n \nFourth Amendment.  The District Court denied the motion, and prosecutors used the records at trial to show that Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s phone was near four of the robbery locations at the time those robberies occurred.   Carpenter was convicted.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that Carpenter lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location information collected by the FBI because he had shared that information with his wireless carriers.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell-site records was a\n \nFourth Amendment search.

Thus, when an individual \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to preserve something as private,\xe2\x80\x9d and his expectation of privacy is \xe2\x80\x9cone that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d official intrusion into that sphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable cause.  <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n442 U.

The analysis regarding which expectations of privacy are entitled to protection is informed by historical understandings \xe2\x80\x9cof what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when [the\n \nFourth Amendment] was adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carroll</i> v. <i>United States,</i>\n\n267 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132, 149.  These Founding-era understandings continue to inform this Court when applying the\n \nFourth Amendment to innovations in surveillance tools.

One set addresses a person\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in his physical location and movements.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Jones, </i>\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400 (five Justices concluding that privacy concerns would be raised by GPS tracking).  The other addresses a person\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in information voluntarily turned over to third parties.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller,</i>\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435 (no expectation of privacy in financial records held by a bank), and <i>Smith, </i>\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735 (no expectation of privacy in records of dialed telephone numbers conveyed to telephone company).  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Tracking a person\xe2\x80\x99s past movements through CSLI partakes of many of the qualities of GPS monitoring considered in <i>Jones\xe2\x80\x94</i>it is detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled.  At the same time, however, the fact that the individual continuously reveals his location to his wireless carrier implicates the third-party principle of <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller.</i>  Given the unique nature of cell-site records, this Court declines to extend <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> to cover them.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0A majority of the Court has already recognized that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements.  Allowing government access to cell-site records\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x9chold for many Americans the \xe2\x80\x98privacies of life,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Riley</i> v. <i>California</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x94contravenes that expectation.  In fact, historical cell-site records present even greater privacy concerns than the GPS monitoring considered in <i>Jones</i>: They give the Government near perfect surveillance and allow it to travel back in time to retrace a person\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, subject only to the five-year retention policies of most wireless carriers.  The Government contends that CSLI data is less precise than GPS information, but it thought the data accurate enough here to highlight it during closing argument in Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  At any rate, the rule the Court adopts \xe2\x80\x9cmust take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Kyllo</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36, and the accuracy of CSLI is rapidly approaching GPS-level precision.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Government contends that the third-party doctrine governs this case, because cell-site records, like the records in <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>, are \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness records,\xe2\x80\x9d created and maintained by wireless carriers.  But there is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i> and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The third-party doctrine partly stems from the notion that an individual has a reduced expectation of privacy in information knowingly shared with another.  <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>, however, did not rely solely on the act of sharing.  They also considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the particular documents sought\xe2\x80\x9d and limitations on any \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate \xe2\x80\x98expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x99 concerning their contents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442.  In mechanically applying the third-party doctrine to this case the Government fails to appreciate the lack of comparable limitations on the revealing nature of CSLI. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Nor does the second rationale for the third-party doctrine\xe2\x80\x94voluntary exposure\xe2\x80\x94hold up when it comes to CSLI.  Cell phone location information is not truly \xe2\x80\x9cshared\xe2\x80\x9d as the term is normally understood.  First, cell phones and the services they provide are \xe2\x80\x9csuch a pervasive and insistent part of daily life\xe2\x80\x9d that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society.  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Second, a cell phone logs a cell-site record by dint of its operation, without any affirmative act on the user\xe2\x80\x99s part beyond powering up.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0This decision is narrow.  It does not express a view on matters not before the Court; does not disturb the application of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller </i>or call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras; does not address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information; and does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.  Pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0 The Government did not obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before acquiring Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell-site records.  It acquired those records pursuant to a court order under the Stored Communications Act, which required the Government to show \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds\xe2\x80\x9d for believing that the records were \xe2\x80\x9crelevant and material to an ongoing investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  That showing falls well short of the probable cause required for a warrant.  Consequently, an order issued under \xc2\xa72703(d) is not a permissible mechanism for accessing historical cell-site records.  Not all orders compelling the production of documents will require a showing of probable cause.  A warrant is required only in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.  And even though the Government will generally need a warrant to access CSLI, case-specific exceptions\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.</i>, exigent circumstances\xe2\x80\x94may support a warrantless search.

Cell phones perform their wide and growing variety of functions by connecting to a set of radio antennas called \xe2\x80\x9ccell sites.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although cell sites are usually mounted on a tower, they can also be found on light posts, flagpoles, church steeples, or the sides of buildings.  Cell sites typically have several directional antennas that divide the covered area into sectors.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cell phones continuously scan their environment looking for the best signal, which generally comes from the closest cell site.  Most modern devices, such as smartphones, tap into the wireless network several times a minute whenever their signal is on, even if the owner is not using one of the phone\xe2\x80\x99s features.  Each time the phone connects to a cell site, it generates a time-stamped record known as cell-site location information (CSLI).  The precision of this information depends on the size of the geographic area covered by the cell site.  The greater the concentration of cell sites, the smaller the coverage area.  As data usage from cell phones has increased, wireless carriers have installed more cell sites to handle the traffic.  That has led to increasingly compact coverage areas, especially in urban areas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Wireless carriers collect and store CSLI for their own business purposes, including finding weak spots in their network and applying \xe2\x80\x9croaming\xe2\x80\x9d charges when another carrier routes data through their cell sites.  In addition, wireless carriers often sell aggregated location records to data brokers, without individual identifying information of the sort at issue here.  While carriers have long retained CSLI for the start and end of incoming calls, in recent years phone companies have also collected location information from the transmission of text messages and routine data connections.  Accordingly, modern cell phones generate increasingly vast amounts of increasingly precise CSLI.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In 2011, police officers arrested four men suspected of robbing a series of Radio Shack and (ironically enough) T-Mobile stores in Detroit.  One of the men confessed that, over the previous four months, the group (along with a rotating cast of getaway drivers and lookouts) had robbed nine different stores in Michigan and Ohio.  The suspect identified 15 accomplices who had participated in the heists and gave the FBI some of their cell phone numbers; the FBI then reviewed his call records to identify additional numbers that he had called around the time of the robberies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on that information, the prosecutors applied for court orders under the Stored Communications Act to obtain cell phone records for petitioner Timothy Carpenter and several other suspects.  That statute, as amended in 1994, permits the Government to compel the disclosure of certain telecommunications records when it \xe2\x80\x9coffers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that the records sought \xe2\x80\x9care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  Federal Magistrate Judges issued two orders directing Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s wireless carriers\xe2\x80\x94MetroPCS and Sprint\xe2\x80\x94to disclose \xe2\x80\x9ccell/site sector [information] for [Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s] telephone[ ] at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls\xe2\x80\x9d during the four-month period when the string of robberies occurred.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a, 72a.  The first order sought 152 days of cell-site records from MetroPCS, which produced records spanning 127 days.  The second order requested seven days of CSLI from Sprint, which produced two days of records covering the period when Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s phone was \xe2\x80\x9croaming\xe2\x80\x9d in northeastern Ohio.  Altogether the Government obtained 12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s movements\xe2\x80\x94an average of 101 data points per day.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Carpenter was charged with six counts of robbery and an additional six counts of carrying a firearm during a federal crime of violence.  See 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7924(c), 1951(a).  Prior to trial, Carpenter moved to suppress the cell-site data provided by the wireless carriers.  He argued that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s seizure of the records violated the\n \nFourth Amendment because they had been obtained without a warrant supported by probable cause.  The District Court denied the motion.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a\xe2\x80\x9339a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At trial, seven of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s confederates pegged him as the leader of the operation.  In addition, FBI agent Christopher Hess offered expert testimony about the cell-site data.  Hess explained that each time a cell phone taps into the wireless network, the carrier logs a time-stamped record of the cell site and particular sector that were used.  With this information, Hess produced maps that placed Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s phone near four of the charged robberies.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, the location records clinched the case: They confirmed that Carpenter was \xe2\x80\x9cright where the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. robbery was at the exact time of the robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 131 (closing argument).  Carpenter was convicted on all but one of the firearm counts and sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  819 F.\xc2\xa03d 880 (2016).  The court held that Carpenter lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location information collected by the FBI because he had shared that information with his wireless carriers.  Given that cell phone users voluntarily convey cell-site data to their carriers as \xe2\x80\x9ca means of establishing communication,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that the resulting business records are not entitled to\n \nFourth Amendment protection.  <i>Id.,</i> at 888 (quoting <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, 741 (1979)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari.  582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cbasic purpose of this Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d our cases have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cis to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Camara</i> v. <i>Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 523, 528 (1967).

We explained that while the general rule allowing warrantless searches incident to arrest \xe2\x80\x9cstrikes the appropriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of its rationales has much force with respect to\xe2\x80\x9d the vast store of sensitive information on a cell phone.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The case before us involves the Government\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of wireless carrier<i> </i>cell-site records revealing the location of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone whenever it made or received calls.<b> </b>This sort of digital data\xe2\x80\x94personal location information maintained by a third party\xe2\x80\x94does not fit neatly under existing precedents.  Instead, requests for cell-site records lie at the intersection of two lines of cases, both of which inform our understanding of the privacy interests at stake.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first set of cases addresses a person\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in his physical location and movements.  In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Knotts</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276 (1983), we considered the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of a \xe2\x80\x9cbeeper\xe2\x80\x9d to aid in tracking a vehicle through traffic.  Police officers in that case planted a beeper in a container of chloroform before it was purchased by one of Knotts\xe2\x80\x99s co-conspirators.  The officers (with intermittent aerial assistance) then followed the automobile carrying the container from Minneapolis to Knotts\xe2\x80\x99s cabin in Wisconsin, relying on the beeper\xe2\x80\x99s signal to help keep the vehicle in view.  The Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9caugment[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d visual surveillance did not constitute a search because \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 281, 282.  Since the movements of the vehicle and its final destination had been \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look,\xe2\x80\x9d Knotts could not assert a privacy interest in the information obtained.  <i>Id.,</i> at 281.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court in <i>Knotts</i>, however, was careful to distinguish between the rudimentary tracking facilitated by the beeper and more sweeping modes of surveillance.  The Court emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9climited use which the government made of the signals from this particular beeper\xe2\x80\x9d during a discrete \xe2\x80\x9cautomotive journey.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 284, 285.  Significantly, the Court reserved the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent constitutional principles may be applicable\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-four hour surveillance of any citizen of this country [were] possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 283\xe2\x80\x93284.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three decades later, the Court considered more sophisticated surveillance of the sort envisioned in <i>Knotts</i> and found that different principles did indeed apply.  In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Jones</i>, FBI agents installed a GPS tracking device on Jones\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle and remotely monitored the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements for 28 days.  The Court decided the case based on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s physical trespass of the vehicle.  565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404\xe2\x80\x93405.  At the same time, five Justices agreed that related privacy concerns would be raised by, for example, \xe2\x80\x9csurreptitiously activating a stolen vehicle detection system\xe2\x80\x9d in Jones\xe2\x80\x99s car to track Jones himself, or conducting GPS tracking of his cell phone.  <i>Id.</i>, at 426, 428 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 415 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  Since GPS monitoring of a vehicle tracks \xe2\x80\x9cevery movement\xe2\x80\x9d a person makes in that vehicle, the concurring Justices concluded that \xe2\x80\x9clonger term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94regardless whether those movements were disclosed to the public at large.  <i>Id.,</i> at 430 (opinion of Alito, J.);<i> id.,</i> at 415 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a second set of decisions, the Court has drawn a line between what a person keeps to himself and what he shares with others.  We have previously held that \xe2\x80\x9ca person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith, </i>442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 743\xe2\x80\x93744.  That remains true \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435, 443 (1976).  As a result, the Government is typically free to obtain such information from the recipient without triggering\n \nFourth Amendment protections.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This third-party doctrine largely traces its roots to <i>Miller</i>.  While investigating Miller for tax evasion, the Government subpoenaed his banks, seeking several months of canceled checks, deposit slips, and monthly statements.  The Court rejected a\n \nFourth Amendment challenge to the records collection.  For one, Miller could \xe2\x80\x9cassert neither ownership nor possession\xe2\x80\x9d of the documents; they were \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness records of the banks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 440.  For another, the nature of those records confirmed Miller\xe2\x80\x99s limited expectation of privacy, because the checks were \xe2\x80\x9cnot confidential communications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions,\xe2\x80\x9d and the bank statements contained information \xe2\x80\x9cexposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 442.  The Court thus concluded that Miller had \xe2\x80\x9ctake[n] the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the information [would] be conveyed by that person to the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 443.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three years later, <i>Smith</i> applied the same principles in the context of information conveyed to a telephone com- pany.  The Court ruled that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of a pen register\xe2\x80\x94a device that recorded the outgoing phone numbers dialed on a landline telephone\xe2\x80\x94was not a search.  Noting the pen register\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9climited capabilities,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt[ed] that people in general entertain any actual expectation of privacy in the numbers they dial.\xe2\x80\x9d  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 742.  Telephone subscribers know, after all, that the numbers are used by the telephone company \xe2\x80\x9cfor a variety of legitimate business purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d including routing calls.  <i>Id.,</i> at 743.  And at any rate, the Court explained, such an expectation \xe2\x80\x9cis not one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  When Smith placed a call, he \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily conveyed\xe2\x80\x9d the dialed numbers to the phone company by \xe2\x80\x9cexpos[ing] that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 744 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Once again, we held that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cassumed the risk\xe2\x80\x9d that the company\xe2\x80\x99s records \xe2\x80\x9cwould be divulged to police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 745.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The question we confront today is how to apply the\n \nFourth Amendment to a new phenomenon: the ability to chronicle a person\xe2\x80\x99s past movements through the record of his cell phone signals.  Such tracking partakes of many of the qualities of the GPS monitoring we considered in <i>Jones</i>.  Much like GPS tracking of a vehicle, cell phone location information is detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the fact that the individual continuously reveals his location to his wireless carrier implicates the third-party principle of <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>.  But while the third-party doctrine applies to telephone numbers and bank records, it is not clear whether its logic extends to the qualitatively different category of cell-site records.  After all, when <i>Smith </i>was decided in 1979, few could have imagined a society in which a phone goes wherever its owner goes, conveying to the wireless carrier not just dialed digits, but a detailed and comprehensive record of the person\xe2\x80\x99s movements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We decline to extend <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller </i>to cover these novel circumstances.  Given the unique nature of cell phone location records, the fact that the information is held by a third party does not by itself overcome the user\xe2\x80\x99s claim to\n \nFourth Amendment protection.  Whether the Government employs its own surveillance technology as in <i>Jones</i> or leverages the technology of a wireless carrier, we hold that an individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through CSLI.  The location information obtained from Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s wireless carriers was the product of a search.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A person does not surrender all\n \nFourth Amendment protection by venturing into the public sphere.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat [one] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Katz</i>, 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 351\xe2\x80\x93352.  A majority of this Court has already recognized that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements.  <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 415 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  Prior to the digital age, law enforcement might have pursued a suspect for a brief stretch, but doing so \xe2\x80\x9cfor any extended period of time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely undertaken.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 429 (opinion of Alito, J.).  For that reason, \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x99s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, in the main, simply could not\xe2\x80\x94secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s car for a very long period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 430.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Allowing government access to cell-site records contravenes that expectation.  Although such records are generated for commercial purposes, that distinction does not negate Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s anticipation of privacy in his physical location.  Mapping a cell phone\xe2\x80\x99s location over the course of 127 days provides an all-encompassing record of the holder\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.  As with GPS information, the time-stamped data provides an intimate window into a person\xe2\x80\x99s life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his \xe2\x80\x9cfamilial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 415 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  These location records \xe2\x80\x9chold for many Americans the \xe2\x80\x98privacies of life.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting <i>Boyd</i>, 116 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 630).  And like GPS monitoring, cell phone tracking is remarkably easy, cheap, and efficient compared to traditional investigative tools.  With just the click of a button, the Government can access each carrier\xe2\x80\x99s deep repository of historical location information at practically no expense.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, historical cell-site records present even greater privacy concerns than the GPS monitoring of a vehicle we considered in <i>Jones</i>.  Unlike the bugged container in <i>Knotts</i> or the car in <i>Jones</i>, a cell phone\xe2\x80\x94almost a \xe2\x80\x9cfeature of human anatomy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)\xe2\x80\x94tracks nearly exactly the movements of its owner.  While individuals regularly leave their vehicles, they compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time.  A cell phone faithfully follows its owner beyond public thoroughfares and into private residences, doctor\xe2\x80\x99s offices, political headquarters, and other potentially revealing locales.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 19) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cnearly three-quarters of smart phone users report being within five feet of their phones most of the time, with 12% admitting that they even use their phones in the shower\xe2\x80\x9d); contrast <i>Cardwell</i> v. <i>Lewis</i>,\n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 583, 590 (1974) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cA car has little capacity for escaping public scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d).<b> </b>Accordingly, when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone\xe2\x80\x99s user.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the retrospective quality of the data here gives police access to a category of information otherwise unknowable.  In the past, attempts to reconstruct a person\xe2\x80\x99s movements were limited by a dearth of records and the frailties of recollection.  With access to CSLI, the Government can now travel back in time to retrace a person\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, subject only to the retention polices of the wireless carriers, which currently maintain records for up to five years.  Critically, because location information is continually logged for all of the 400 million devices in the United States\xe2\x80\x94not just those belonging to persons who might happen to come under investigation\xe2\x80\x94this newfound tracking capacity runs against everyone.  Unlike with the GPS device in <i>Jones</i>, police need not even know in advance whether they want to follow a particular individual, or when.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whoever the suspect turns out to be, he has effectively been tailed every moment of every day for five years, and the police may\xe2\x80\x94in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view\xe2\x80\x94call upon the results of that surveillance without regard to the constraints of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Only the few with- out cell phones could escape this tireless and absolute surveillance.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government and Justice Kennedy contend, however, that the collection of CSLI should be permitted because the data is less precise than GPS information.  Not to worry, they maintain, because the location records did \xe2\x80\x9cnot on their own suffice to place [Carpenter] at the crime scene\xe2\x80\x9d; they placed him within a wedge-shaped sector ranging from one-eighth to four square miles.  Brief for United States 24; see <i>post, </i>at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Yet the Court has already rejected the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cinference insulates a search.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kyllo</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36.  From the 127 days of location data it received, the Government could, in combination with other information, deduce a detailed log of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s movements, including when he was at the site of the robberies.  And the Government thought the CSLI accurate enough to highlight it during the closing argument of his trial.  App. 131.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At any rate, the rule the Court adopts \xe2\x80\x9cmust take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kyllo</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36.  While the records in this case reflect the state of technology at the start of the decade, the accuracy of CSLI is rapidly approaching GPS-level precision.  As the number of cell sites has proliferated, the geographic area covered by each cell sector has shrunk, particularly in urban areas.  In addition, with new technology measuring the time and angle of signals hitting their towers, wireless carriers already have the capability to pinpoint a phone\xe2\x80\x99s location within 50 meters.  Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12 (describing triangulation methods that estimate a device\xe2\x80\x99s location inside a given cell sector).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, when the Government accessed CSLI from the wireless carriers, it invaded Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s reason- able expectation of privacy in the whole of his physical movements.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary contention to the contrary is that the third-party doctrine governs this case.  In its view, cell-site records are fair game because they are \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness records\xe2\x80\x9d created and maintained by the wireless carriers.  The Government (along with Justice Kennedy) recognizes that this case features new technology, but asserts that the legal question nonetheless turns on a garden-variety request for information from a third-party witness.  Brief for United States 32\xe2\x80\x9334; <i>post, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position fails to contend with the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s location but also everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s, not for a short period but for years and years.  Sprint Corporation and its competitors are not your typical witnesses.  Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible.  There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today.  The Government thus is not asking for a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant extension of it to a distinct category of information.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The third-party doctrine partly stems from the notion that an individual has a reduced expectation of privacy in information knowingly shared with another.  But the fact of \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished privacy interests does not mean that the\n \nFourth Amendment falls out of the picture entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i>, after all, did not rely solely on the act of sharing.  Instead, they considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the particular documents sought\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a legitimate \xe2\x80\x98expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x99 concerning their contents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442.  <i>Smith</i> pointed out the limited capabilities of a pen register; as explained in <i>Riley</i>, telephone call logs reveal little in the way of \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 742; <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).  <i>Miller</i> likewise noted that checks were \xe2\x80\x9cnot confidential communications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442.  In mechanically applying the third-party doctrine to this case, the Government fails to appreciate that there are no comparable limitations on the revealing nature of CSLI.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has in fact already shown special solicitude for location information in the third-party context.  In <i>Knotts</i>, the Court relied on <i>Smith</i> to hold that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in public movements that he \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Knotts</i>, 460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281; see <i>id.</i>, at 283 (discussing <i>Smith</i>).  But when confronted with more pervasive tracking, five Justices agreed that longer term GPS monitoring of even a vehicle traveling on public streets constitutes a search.  <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.</i>, at 415 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  Justice Gorsuch wonders why \xe2\x80\x9csomeone\xe2\x80\x99s location when using a phone\xe2\x80\x9d is sensitive, <i>post, </i>at 3, and Justice Kennedy assumes that a person\xe2\x80\x99s discrete movements \xe2\x80\x9care not particularly private,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post,</i> at 17.  Yet this case is not about \xe2\x80\x9cusing a phone\xe2\x80\x9d or a person\xe2\x80\x99s movement at a particular time.  It is about a detailed chronicle of a person\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence compiled every day, every moment, over several years.  Such a chronicle implicates privacy concerns far beyond those considered in <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither does the second rationale underlying the third-party doctrine\xe2\x80\x94voluntary exposure\xe2\x80\x94hold up when it comes to CSLI.  Cell phone location information is not truly \xe2\x80\x9cshared\xe2\x80\x9d as one normally understands the term.  In the first place, cell phones and the services they provide are \xe2\x80\x9csuch a pervasive and insistent part of daily life\xe2\x80\x9d that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society.  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Second, a cell phone logs a cell-site record by dint of its operation, without any affirmative act on the part of the user beyond powering up.  Virtually any activity on the phone generates CSLI, including incoming calls, texts, or e-mails and countless other data connections that a phone automatically makes when checking for news, weather, or social media updates.  Apart from disconnecting the phone from the network, there is no way to avoid leaving behind a trail of location data.  As a result, in no meaningful sense does the user voluntarily \xe2\x80\x9cassume[\xc2\xa0] the risk\xe2\x80\x9d of turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical movements.  <i>Smith</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 745.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore decline to extend <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> to the collection of CSLI.  Given the unique nature of cell phone location information, the fact that the Government obtained the information from a third party does not overcome Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s claim to\n \nFourth Amendment protection.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of the cell-site records was a search within the meaning of the\n \nFourth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our decision today is a narrow one.  We do not express a view on matters not before us: real-time CSLI or \xe2\x80\x9ctower dumps\xe2\x80\x9d (a download of information on all the devices that connected to a particular cell site during a particular interval).  We do not disturb the application of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller </i>or call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras. <i> </i>Nor do we address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information.  Further, our opinion does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.  As Justice Frankfurter noted when considering new innovations in airplanes and radios, the Court must tread carefully in such cases, to ensure that we do not \xe2\x80\x9cembarrass the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Minnesota</i>,\n\n322 U.\xc2\xa0S. 292, 300 (1944).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having found that the acquisition of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s CSLI was a search, we also conclude that the Government must generally obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before acquiring such records.  Although the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d our cases establish that warrantless searches are typically unreasonable where \xe2\x80\x9ca search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Vernonia School Dist. 47J</i> v. <i>Acton</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646, 652\xe2\x80\x93653 (1995).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the absence of a warrant, a search is reasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the warrant requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government acquired the cell-site records pursuant to a court order issued under the Stored Communications Act, which required the Government to show \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds\xe2\x80\x9d for believing that the records were \xe2\x80\x9crelevant and material to an ongoing investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  That showing falls well short of the probable cause required for a warrant.  The Court usually requires \xe2\x80\x9csome quantum of individualized suspicion\xe2\x80\x9d before a search or seizure may take place.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Martinez-Fuerte</i>,\n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 543, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (1976).  Under the standard in the Stored Communications Act, however, law enforcement need only show that the cell-site evidence might be pertinent to an ongoing investigation\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cgigantic\xe2\x80\x9d departure from the probable cause rule, as the Government explained below.  App. 34.  Consequently, an order issued under Section 2703(d) of the Act is not a permissible mechanism for accessing historical cell-site records.  Before compelling a wireless carrier to turn over a subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s CSLI, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation is a familiar one\xe2\x80\x94get a warrant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Alito contends that the warrant requirement simply does not apply when the Government acquires records using compulsory process.  Unlike an actual search, he says, subpoenas for documents do not involve the direct taking of evidence; they are at most a \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive search\xe2\x80\x9d conducted by the target of the subpoena.  <i>Post, </i>at 12.  Given this lesser intrusion on personal privacy, Justice Alito argues that the compulsory production of records is not held to the same probable cause standard.  In his view, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents set forth a categorical rule\xe2\x80\x94separate and distinct from the third-party doctrine\xe2\x80\x94subjecting subpoenas to lenient scrutiny without regard to the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in the records.  <i>Post, </i>at 8\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this Court has never held that the Government may subpoena third parties for records in which the suspect has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Almost all of the examples Justice Alito cites, see <i>post, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, contemplated requests for evidence implicating diminished pri- vacy interests or for a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s own books.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The lone exception, of course, is <i>Miller</i>, where the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the third-party subpoena merged with the application of the third-party doctrine.  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444 (concluding that Miller lacked the necessary privacy interest to contest the issuance of a subpoena to his bank).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Alito overlooks the critical issue.  At some point, the dissent should recognize that CSLI is an entirely different species of business record\xe2\x80\x94something that implicates basic\n \nFourth Amendment concerns about arbitrary government power much more directly than corporate tax or payroll ledgers.  When confronting new concerns wrought by digital technology, this Court has been careful not to uncritically extend existing precedents.  See <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (\xe2\x80\x9cA search of the information on a cell phone bears little resemblance to the type of brief physical search considered [in prior precedents].\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the choice to proceed by subpoena provided a categorical limitation on\n \nFourth Amendment protection, no type of record would ever be protected by the warrant requirement.  Under Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s view, private letters, digital contents of a cell phone\xe2\x80\x94any personal information reduced to document form, in fact\xe2\x80\x94may be collected by subpoena for no reason other than \xe2\x80\x9cofficial curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton Salt Co.</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 632, 652 (1950).  Justice Kennedy declines to adopt the radical implications of this theory, leaving open the question whether the warrant requirement applies \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Government obtains the modern-day equivalents of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x98papers\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98effects,\xe2\x80\x99 even when those papers or effects are held by a third party.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 13 (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Warshak</i>, 631 F.\xc2\xa03d 266, 283\xe2\x80\x93288 (CA6 2010)).  That would be a sensible exception, because it would prevent the subpoena doctrine from overcoming any reasonable expectation of privacy.  If the third-party doctrine does not apply to the \xe2\x80\x9cmodern-day equivalents of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x98papers\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98effects,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d then the clear implication is that the documents should receive full\n \nFourth Amendment protection.  We simply think that such protection should extend as well to a detailed log of a person\xe2\x80\x99s movements over several years.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is certainly not to say that all orders compelling the production of documents will require a showing of probable cause.  The Government will be able to use subpoenas to acquire records in the overwhelming majority of investigations.  We hold only that a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, even though the Government will generally need a warrant to access CSLI, case-specific exceptions may support a warrantless search of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s cell-site records under certain circumstances.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne well-recognized exception applies when \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe exigencies of the situation\xe2\x80\x9d make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>King</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, 460 (2011) (quoting <i>Mincey</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, 394 (1978)).  Such exigencies include the need to pursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm, or prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.  563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 460, and n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a result, if law enforcement is confronted with an urgent situation, such fact-specific threats will likely justify the warrantless collection of CSLI.  Lower courts, for instance, have approved warrantless searches related to bomb threats, active shootings, and child abductions.  Our decision today does not call into doubt warrantless access to CSLI in such circumstances.  While police must get a warrant when collecting CSLI to assist in the mine-run criminal investigation, the rule we set forth does not limit their ability to respond to an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As Justice Brandeis explained in his famous dissent, the Court is obligated\xe2\x80\x94as \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become available to the Government\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to ensure that the \xe2\x80\x9cprogress of science\xe2\x80\x9d does not erode\n \nFourth Amendment protections.  <i>Olmstead</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438, 473\xe2\x80\x93474 (1928).  Here the progress of science has afforded law enforcement a powerful new tool to carry out its important responsibilities.

Then, in a pair of decisions in the 1970s applying the <i>Katz</i> test, the Court held that a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d <i>doesn\xe2\x80\x99t</i> attach to information shared with \xe2\x80\x9cthird parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, 743\xe2\x80\x93744 (1979); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435, 443 (1976).  By these steps, the Court came to conclude, the Constitution does nothing to limit investigators from searching records you\xe2\x80\x99ve entrusted to your bank, accountant, and maybe even your doctor.</p><p>What\xe2\x80\x99s left of the Fourth Amendment?  Today we use the Internet to do most everything.  Smartphones make it easy to keep a calendar, correspond with friends, make calls, conduct banking, and even watch the game.  Countless Internet companies maintain records about us and, increasingly, <i>for </i>us.  Even our most private documents\xe2\x80\x94those that, in other eras, we would have locked safely in a desk drawer or destroyed\xe2\x80\x94now reside on third party servers.  <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller </i>teach that the police can review all of this material, on the theory that no one reasonably expects any of it will be kept private.  But no one believes that, if they ever did.</p><p>What to do?  It seems to me we could respond in at least three ways.  The first is to ignore the problem, maintain <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i>, and live with the consequences.  If the confluence of these decisions and modern technology means our Fourth Amendment rights are reduced to nearly nothing, so be it.  The second choice is to set <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller </i>aside and try again using the <i>Katz</i> \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d jurisprudence that produced them.  The third is to look for answers elsewhere.</p><p>*</p><p>Start with the first option.  <i>Smith</i> held that the government\xe2\x80\x99s use of a pen register to record the numbers people dial on their phones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy because that information is freely disclosed to the third party phone company.  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 743\xe2\x80\x93744.  <i>Miller</i> held that a bank account holder enjoys no reason- able expectation of privacy in the bank\xe2\x80\x99s records of his account activity.  That\xe2\x80\x99s true, the Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.\xe2\x80\x9d  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 443.  Today the Court suggests that <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller </i>distinguish between <i>kinds</i> of information disclosed to third parties and require courts to decide whether to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d those decisions to particular classes of information, depending on their sensitivity.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9318.  But as the Sixth Circuit recognized and Justice Kennedy explains, no balancing test of this kind can be found in <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i>.  See <i>ante</i>, at 16 (dissenting opinion).  Those cases<i> </i>announced a categorical rule: Once you disclose information to third parties, you forfeit any reason- able expectation of privacy you might have had in it.  And even if <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> did permit courts to conduct a balancing contest of the kind the Court now suggests, it\xe2\x80\x99s still hard to see how that would help the petitioner in this case.  Why is someone\xe2\x80\x99s location when using a phone so much more sensitive than who he was talking to (<i>Smith</i>) or what financial transactions he engaged in (<i>Miller</i>)?  I do not know and the Court does not say.</p><p>The problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t with the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s application of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> but with the cases themselves.  Can the government demand a copy of all your e-mails from Google or Microsoft without implicating your Fourth Amendment rights?  Can it secure your DNA from 23andMe without a warrant or probable cause?  <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i> say yes it can\xe2\x80\x94at least without running afoul of <i>Katz</i>.  But that result strikes most lawyers and judges today\xe2\x80\x94me in- cluded\xe2\x80\x94as pretty unlikely.  In the years since its adoption, countless scholars, too, have come to conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cthird-party doctrine is not only wrong, but horribly wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kerr, The Case for the Third-Party Doctrine, 107 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 561, 563, n.\xc2\xa05, 564 (2009) (collecting criticisms but defending the doctrine (footnotes omitted)).  The reasons are obvious.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs an empirical statement about subjective expectations of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctrine is \xe2\x80\x9cquite dubious.\xe2\x80\x9d  Baude &amp; Stern, The Positive Law Model of the Fourth Amendment, 129 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1821, 1872 (2016).  People often <i>do</i> reasonably expect that information they entrust to third parties, especially information subject to confidentiality agreements, will be kept private.  Meanwhile, if the third party doctrine is supposed to represent a normative assessment of when a person should expect privacy, the notion that the answer might be \xe2\x80\x9cnever\xe2\x80\x9d seems a pretty unattractive societal prescription.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>What, then, is the explanation for our third party doctrine?  The truth is, the Court has never offered a persuasive justification.  The Court has said that by conveying information to a third party you \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assum[e] the risk\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it will be revealed to the police and therefore lack a reason- able expectation of privacy in it.  <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 744.  But assumption of risk doctrine developed in tort law.  It generally applies when \xe2\x80\x9cby contract or otherwise [one] expressly agrees to accept a risk of harm\xe2\x80\x9d or impliedly does so by \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[ing] his willingness to accept\xe2\x80\x9d that risk and thereby \xe2\x80\x9ctake[s] his chances as to harm which may result from it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7496B, 496C(1), and Comment <i>b</i> (1965); see also 1 D.

Suppose I entrust a friend with a letter and he promises to keep it secret until he delivers it to an intended recipient.  In what sense have I agreed to bear the risk that he will turn around, break his promise, and spill its contents to someone else?  More confusing still, what have I done to \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest my willingness to accept\xe2\x80\x9d the risk that the government will pry the document from my friend and read it <i>without</i> his consent?</p><p>One possible answer concerns knowledge.  I know that my friend <i>might</i> break his promise, or that the government <i>might</i> have some reason to search the papers in his possession.  But knowing about a risk doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you assume responsibility for it.  Whenever you walk down the sidewalk you know a car may negligently or recklessly veer off and hit you, but that hardly means you accept the consequences and absolve the driver of any damage he may do to you.

Owen, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Law of Torts 490 (5th ed. 1984).</p><p>Some have suggested the third party doctrine is better understood to rest on consent than assumption of risk.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo long as a person knows that they are disclosing information to a third party,\xe2\x80\x9d the argument goes, \xe2\x80\x9ctheir choice to do so is voluntary and the consent valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kerr, <i>supra,</i> at 588.  I confess I still don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.  Consenting to give a third party access to private papers that remain my property is not the same thing as consenting to a <i>search of those</i> <i>papers by the government.</i>  Perhaps there are exceptions, like when the third party is an undercover government agent.  See Murphy, The Case Against the Case Against the Third-Party Doctrine: A Response to Epstein and Kerr, 24 Berkeley Tech. L.\xc2\xa0J. 1239, 1252 (2009); cf. <i>Hoffa</i> v. <i>United States</i>,385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 293 (1966).  But otherwise this conception of consent appears to be just assumption of risk relabeled\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x9cconsented\xe2\x80\x9d to whatever risks are foreseeable.</p><p>Another justification sometimes offered for third party doctrine is clarity.  You (and the police) know exactly how much protection you have in information confided to others: none.  As rules go, \xe2\x80\x9cthe king always wins\xe2\x80\x9d is admi- rably clear.  But the opposite rule would be clear too: Third party disclosures <i>never</i> diminish Fourth Amendment protection (call it \xe2\x80\x9cthe king always loses\xe2\x80\x9d).  So clarity alone cannot justify the third party doctrine.</p><p>In the end, what do <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller </i>add up to?  A doubtful application of <i>Katz</i> that lets the government search almost whatever it wants whenever it wants.  The Sixth Circuit had to follow that rule and faithfully did just that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why we should.</p><p>*</p><p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a second option.  What if we dropped <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i>\xe2\x80\x99s third party doctrine and retreated to the root <i>Katz</i> question whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in data held by third parties?  Rather than solve the problem with the third party doctrine, I worry this option only risks returning us to its source: After all, it was <i>Katz</i> that produced <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> in the first place.</p><p><i>Katz\xe2\x80\x99s</i> problems start with the text and original understanding of the Fourth Amendment, as Justice Thomas thoughtfully explains today.  <i>Ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x9317 (dissenting opinion).  The Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections do not depend on the breach of some abstract \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d whose contours are left to the judicial imagination.  Much more concretely, it protects your \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d and your \xe2\x80\x9chouses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does your right to bring a Fourth Amendment claim depend on whether a judge happens to agree that your subjective expectation to privacy is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d one.  Under its plain terms, the Amendment grants you the right to invoke its guarantees whenever one of your protected things (your person, your house, your papers, or your effects) is unreasonably searched or seized.  Period.</p><p>History too holds problems for <i>Katz</i>.  Little like it can be found in the law that led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment or in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence until the late 1960s.  The Fourth Amendment came about in response to a trio of 18th century cases \xe2\x80\x9cwell known to the men who wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights, [and] famous throughout the colonial population.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of Criminal Procedure, 105 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 393, 397 (1995).  The first two were English cases invalidating the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s use of general warrants to enter homes and search papers.  <i>Entick</i> v. <i>Carrington</i>, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1765); <i>Wilkes</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, 19 How. St. Tr. 1153 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1763); see W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 439\xe2\x80\x93487 (2009); <i>Boyd</i> v. <i>United States</i>,116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616, 625\xe2\x80\x93630 (1886).  The third was American: the Boston Writs of Assistance Case, which sparked colonial outrage at the use of writs permitting government agents to enter houses and business, breaking open doors and chests along the way, to conduct searches and seizures\xe2\x80\x94and to force third parties to help them.  Stuntz, <i>supra,</i> at 404\xe2\x80\x93409; M. Smith, The Writs of Assistance Case (1978).  No doubt the colonial outrage engendered by these cases rested in part on the government\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion upon privacy.  But the framers chose not to protect privacy in some ethereal way dependent on judicial intuitions.  They chose instead to protect privacy in particular places and things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and against particular threats\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d governmental \xe2\x80\x9csearches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Entick</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 1066 (\xe2\x80\x9cPapers are the owner\xe2\x80\x99s goods and chattels; they are his dearest property; and so far from enduring a seizure, that they will hardly bear an inspection\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>ante,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x9321 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p><p>Even taken on its own terms, <i>Katz</i> has never been sufficiently justified.  In fact, we still don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what its \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d test <i>is</i>.  Is it supposed to pose an empirical question (what privacy expectations do people <i>actually</i> have) or a normative one (what expectations <i>should</i> they have)?  Either way brings problems.  If the test is supposed to be an empirical one, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear why judges rather than legislators should conduct it.  Legislators are responsive to their constituents and have institutional resources designed to help them discern and enact majoritarian preferences.  Politically insulated judges come armed with only the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 briefs, a few law clerks, and their own idiosyncratic experiences.  They are hardly the representative group you\xe2\x80\x99d expect (or want) to be making empirical judgments for hundreds of millions of people.  Unsurprisingly, too, judicial judgments often fail to reflect public views.  See Slobogin &amp; Schumacher, Reasonable Expectations of Privacy and Autonomy in Fourth Amendment Cases: An Empirical Look at \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstandings Recognized and Permitted by Society,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 Duke L. J. 727, 732, 740\xe2\x80\x93742 (1993).  Consider just one example.  Our cases insist that the seriousness of the offense being investigated does <i>not</i> reduce Fourth Amendment protection.  <i>Mincey</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, 393\xe2\x80\x93394 (1978).  Yet scholars suggest that most people <i>are </i>more tolerant of police intrusions when they investigate more serious crimes.  See Blumenthal, Adya, &amp; Mogle, The Multiple Dimensions of Privacy: Testing Lay \xe2\x80\x9cExpectations of Privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 331, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (2009).  And I very much doubt that this Court would be willing to adjust its <i>Katz</i> cases to reflect these findings even if it believed them.</p><p>Maybe, then, the <i>Katz</i> test should be conceived as a normative question.  But if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, why (again) do judges, rather than legislators, get to determine whether society <i>should be</i> prepared to recognize an expectation of privacy as legitimate?  Deciding what privacy interests <i>should be</i> recognized often calls for a pure policy choice, many times between incommensurable goods\xe2\x80\x94between the value of privacy in a particular setting and society\xe2\x80\x99s interest in combating crime.  Answering questions like that calls for the exercise of raw political will belonging to legislatures, not the legal judgment proper to courts.  See The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  When judges abandon legal judgment for political will we not only risk decisions where \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectations of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d come to bear \xe2\x80\x9can uncanny resemblance to those expectations of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d shared by Members of this Court.  <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Carter</i>,525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, 97 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring).  We also risk undermining public confidence in the courts themselves.</p><p>My concerns about <i>Katz</i> come with a caveat.  <i>Sometimes</i>, I accept, judges may be able to discern and describe existing societal norms.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Jardines</i>,569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 8 (2013) (inferring a license to enter on private property from the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98habits of the country\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>McKee</i> v. <i>Gratz</i>,260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 127, 136 (1922))); Sachs, Finding Law, 107 Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. (forthcoming 2019), online at https://ssrn.com/ abstract=3064443 (as last visited June 19, 2018).  That is particularly true when the judge looks to positive law rather than intuition for guidance on social norms.  See <i>Byrd </i>v. <i>United States, </i>584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2018) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x939) (\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral property-based concept[s] guid[e] the resolution of this case\xe2\x80\x9d).  So there may be <i>some </i>occasions where <i>Katz</i> is capable of principled application\xe2\x80\x94though it may simply wind up approximating the more traditional option I will discuss in a moment.  Sometimes it may also be possible to apply <i>Katz</i> by analogizing from precedent when the line between an existing case and a new fact pattern is short and direct.  But so far this Court has declined to tie itself to any significant restraints like these.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile property rights are often informative, our cases by no means suggest that such an interest is \xe2\x80\x98fundamental\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98dispositive\xe2\x80\x99 in determining which expectations of privacy are legitimate\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>As a result, <i>Katz</i> has yielded an often unpredictable\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes unbelievable\xe2\x80\x94jurisprudence.  <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> are only two examples; there are many others.  Take <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Riley</i>,488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 445 (1989), which says that a police helicopter hovering 400 feet above a person\xe2\x80\x99s property invades no reasonable expectation of privacy.  Try that one out on your neighbors.  Or <i>California</i> v. <i>Greenwood</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 35 (1988), which holds that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the garbage he puts out for collection.  In that case, the Court said that the homeowners forfeited their privacy interests because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 40 (footnotes omitted).  But the habits of raccoons don\xe2\x80\x99t prove much about the habits of the country.  I doubt, too, that most people spotting a neighbor rummaging through their garbage would think they lacked reasonable grounds to confront the rummager.  Making the decision all the stranger, California state law expressly <i>protected</i> a homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s property rights in discarded trash.  <i>Id.</i>, at 43.  Yet rather than defer to that as evidence of the people\xe2\x80\x99s habits and reasonable expectations of privacy, the Court substituted its own curious judgment.</p><p>Resorting to <i>Katz</i> in data privacy cases threatens more of the same.  Just consider.  The Court today says that judges should use <i>Katz</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectation of privacy test to decide what Fourth Amendment rights people have in cell-site location information, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cno single rubric definitively resolves which expectations of privacy are entitled to protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 5.  But then it offers a twist.  Lower courts should be sure to add two special principles to their <i>Katz</i> calculus: the need to avoid \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary power\xe2\x80\x9d and the importance of \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ing] obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).  While surely laudable, these principles don\xe2\x80\x99t offer lower courts much guidance.  The Court does not tell us, for example, how far to carry either principle or how to weigh them against the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At what point does access to electronic data amount to \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d authority?  When does police surveillance become \xe2\x80\x9ctoo permeating\xe2\x80\x9d?  And what sort of \xe2\x80\x9cobstacles\xe2\x80\x9d should judges \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d in law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s path when it does?  We simply do not know.</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of these principles supplies little more direction.  The Court declines to say whether there is any sufficiently limited period of time \xe2\x80\x9cfor which the Government may obtain an individual\xe2\x80\x99s historical [location information] free from Fourth Amendment scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11, n.\xc2\xa03; see <i>ante,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9315.  But then it tells us that access to seven days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of information <i>does</i> trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94even though here the carrier \xe2\x80\x9cproduced only two days of records.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11, n. 3<i>.</i>  Why is the relevant fact the seven days of information the government <i>asked for</i> instead of the two days of information the government <i>actually saw</i>?  Why seven days instead of ten or three or one?  And in what possible sense did the government \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d five days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of location information it was never even sent?  We do not know.</p><p>Later still, the Court adds that it can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether the Fourth Amendment is triggered when the government collects \xe2\x80\x9creal-time CSLI or \xe2\x80\x98tower dumps\xe2\x80\x99 (a download of information on all the devices that connected to a particular cell site during a particular interval).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  But what distinguishes historical data from real-time data, or seven days of a single person\xe2\x80\x99s data from a download of <i>everyone</i>\xe2\x80\x99s data over some indefinite period of time?  Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tower dump the <i>paradigmatic</i> example of \xe2\x80\x9ctoo permeating police surveillance\xe2\x80\x9d and a dangerous tool of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d authority\xe2\x80\x94the touchstones of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s modified <i>Katz</i> analysis?  On what possible basis could such mass data collection survive the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test while collecting a single person\xe2\x80\x99s data does not?  Here again we are left to guess.  At the same time, though, the Court offers some firm assurances.  It tells us its decision does <i>not </i>\xe2\x80\x9ccall into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That, however, just raises more questions for lower courts to sort out about what techniques qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cconventional\xe2\x80\x9d and why those techniques would be okay <i>even if</i> they lead to \xe2\x80\x9cpermeating police surveillance\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary police power.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Nor is this the end of it.  After finding a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Court says there\xe2\x80\x99s still more work to do.  Courts must determine whether to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i> to the circumstances before them.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11, 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  So apparently <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite left for dead; they just no longer have the clear reach they once did.  How do we measure their new reach?  The Court says courts now must conduct a <i>second</i> <i>Katz</i>-like balancing inquiry, asking whether the fact of disclosure to a third party outweighs privacy interests in the \xe2\x80\x9ccategory of information\xe2\x80\x9d so disclosed.  <i>Ante,</i> at 13, 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  But how are lower courts supposed to weigh these radically different interests?  Or assign values to different categories of information?  All we know is that historical cell-site location information (for seven days, anyway) escapes <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>\xe2\x80\x99s shorn grasp, while a lifetime of bank or phone records does not.  As to any other kind of information, lower courts will have to stay tuned.</p><p>In the end, our lower court colleagues are left with two amorphous balancing tests, a series of weighty and incommensurable principles to consider in them, and a few illustrative examples that seem little more than the product of judicial intuition.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s defense, though, we have arrived at this strange place not because the Court has misunderstood <i>Katz</i>.  Far from it.  We have arrived here because this is where <i>Katz</i> inevitably leads.</p><p>*</p><p>There is another way.  From the founding until the 1960s, the right to assert a Fourth Amendment claim didn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on your ability to appeal to a judge\xe2\x80\x99s per- sonal sensibilities about the \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d of your expectations or privacy.  It was tied to the law.  <i>Jardines</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 405 (2012).  The Fourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  True to those words and their original understanding, the traditional approach asked if a house, paper or effect was <i>yours</i> under law.  No more was needed to trigger the Fourth Amendment.  Though now often lost in <i>Katz</i>\xe2\x80\x99s shadow, this traditional understanding persists.  <i>Katz</i> only \xe2\x80\x9csupplements, rather than displaces the traditional property-based understanding of the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Byrd</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Jardines</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 11 (same); <i>Soldal</i> v. <i>Cook County</i>,506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56, 64 (1992) (<i>Katz </i>did not \xe2\x80\x9csnuf[f\xc2\xa0] out the previously recognized protection for property under the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Beyond its provenance in the text and original understanding of the Amendment, this traditional approach comes with other advantages.  Judges are supposed to decide cases based on \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratically legitimate sources of law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94like positive law or analogies to items protected by the enacted Constitution\xe2\x80\x94rather than \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own biases or personal policy preferences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pettys, Judicial Discretion in Constitutional Cases, 26 J. L. &amp; Pol. 123, 127 (2011).  A Fourth Amendment model based on positive legal rights \xe2\x80\x9ccarves out significant room for legislative participation in the Fourth Amendment context,\xe2\x80\x9d too, by asking judges to consult what the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives have to say about their rights.  Baude &amp; Stern, 129 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 1852.  Nor is this approach hobbled by <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>, for those cases are just <i>limitations</i> on <i>Katz</i>, addressing only the question whether individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in materials they share with third parties.  Under this more traditional approach, Fourth Amendment protections for your papers and effects do not automatically disappear just because you share them with third parties.</p><p>Given the prominence <i>Katz </i>has claimed in our doctrine, American courts are pretty rusty at applying the traditional approach to the Fourth Amendment.  We know that if a house, paper, or effect is yours, you have a Fourth Amendment interest in its protection.  But what kind of legal interest is sufficient to make something <i>yours</i>?  And what source of law determines that?  Current positive law?  The common law at 1791, extended by analogy to modern times?  Both?  See <i>Byrd</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932) (Thomas, J., concurring); cf. Re, The Positive Law Floor, 129 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 313 (2016).  Much work is needed to revitalize this area and answer these questions.  I do not begin to claim all the answers today, but (unlike with <i>Katz</i>) at least I have a pretty good idea what the questions <i>are</i>.  And it seems to me a few things can be said.</p><p><i>First</i>, the fact that a third party has access to or possession of your papers and effects does not necessarily eliminate your interest in them.  Ever hand a private document to a friend to be returned?  Toss your keys to a valet at a restaurant?  Ask your neighbor to look after your dog while you travel?  You would not expect the friend to share the document with others; the valet to lend your car to his buddy; or the neighbor to put Fido up for adoption.  Entrusting your stuff to others is a <i>bailment</i>.  A bailment is the \xe2\x80\x9cdelivery of personal property by one person (the <i>bailor</i>) to another (the <i>bailee</i>) who holds the property for a  certain purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 169 (10th ed. 2014); J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments \xc2\xa72, p.\xc2\xa02 (1832) (\xe2\x80\x9ca bailment is a delivery of a thing in trust for some special object or purpose, and upon a contract, expressed or implied, to conform to the object or purpose of the trust\xe2\x80\x9d).  A bailee normally owes a legal duty to keep the item safe, according to the terms of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract if they have one, and according to the \xe2\x80\x9cimplication[s] from their conduct\xe2\x80\x9d if they don\xe2\x80\x99t.  8 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Bailments \xc2\xa736, pp. 468\xe2\x80\x93469 (2017).  A bailee who uses the item in a different way than he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to, or against the bailor\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, is liable for conversion.  <i>Id.</i>, \xc2\xa743, at 481; see <i>Goad</i> v. <i>Harris</i>, 207 Ala. 357, 92 So. 546, (1922); <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Seney</i>, 290 Ill. 11, 17, 124 N.\xc2\xa0E. 813, 815\xe2\x80\x93816 (1919); <i>Baxter </i>v. <i>Woodward</i>, 191 Mich. 379, 385, 158 N.\xc2\xa0W. 137, 139 (1916).  This approach is quite different from <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller</i>\xe2\x80\x99s (counter)-intuitive approach to reasonable expectations of privacy; where those cases extinguish Fourth Amendment interests once records are given to a third party, property law may preserve them.</p><p>Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence already reflects this truth.  In <i>Ex parte Jackson</i>,96 U.\xc2\xa0S. 727 (1878), this Court held that sealed letters placed in the mail are \xe2\x80\x9cas fully guarded from examination and inspection, except as to their outward form and weight, as if they were retained by the parties forwarding them in their own domiciles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 733.  The reason, drawn from the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, was that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to be secure in their papers against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to <i>their papers</i>, thus closed against inspection, <i>wherever they may be</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  It did not matter that letters were bailed to a third party (the government, no less).  The sender enjoyed the same Fourth Amendment protection as he does \xe2\x80\x9cwhen papers are subjected to search in one\xe2\x80\x99s own household.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>These ancient principles may help us address modern data cases too.  Just because you entrust your data\xe2\x80\x94in some cases, your modern-day papers and effects\xe2\x80\x94to a third party may not mean you lose any Fourth Amendment interest in its contents.  Whatever may be left of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i>, few doubt that e-mail should be treated much like the traditional mail it has largely supplanted\xe2\x80\x94as a bailment in which the owner retains a vital and protected legal interest.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that enhanced Fourth Amendment protection may apply when the \xe2\x80\x9cmodern-day equivalents of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x98papers\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98effects\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are held by a third party\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9cbailment\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ante,</i> at 23, n.\xc2\xa06 (Alito, J., dissenting) (reserving the question whether Fourth Amendment protection may apply in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cbailment\xe2\x80\x9d or when \xe2\x80\x9csomeone has entrusted papers he or she owns .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the safekeeping of another\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Warshak</i>, 631 F.\xc2\xa03d 266, 285\xe2\x80\x93286 (CA6 2010) (relying on an analogy to <i>Jackson</i> to extend Fourth Amendment protection to e-mail held by a third party service provider).</p><p><i>Second</i>, I doubt that complete ownership or exclusive control of property is always a necessary condition to the assertion of a Fourth Amendment right.  Where houses are concerned, for example, individuals can enjoy Fourth Amendment protection without fee simple title.  Both the text of the Amendment and the common law rule support that conclusion.  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople call a house \xe2\x80\x98their\xe2\x80\x99 home when legal title is in the bank, when they rent it, and even when they merely occupy it rent free.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396 (Scalia, J., concurring).  That rule derives from the common law.  <i>Oystead</i> v. <i>Shed</i>, 13 Mass. 520, 523 (1816) (explaining, citing \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he very learned judges, <i>Foster</i>, <i>Hale</i>, and <i>Coke</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d that the law \xe2\x80\x9cwould be as much disturbed by a forcible entry to arrest a boarder or a servant, who had acquired, by contract, express or implied, a right to enter the house at all times, and to remain in it as long as they please, as if the object were to arrest the master of the house or his children\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is why tenants and resident family members\xe2\x80\x94though they have no legal title\xe2\x80\x94have standing to complain about searches of the houses in which they live.  <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 610, 616\xe2\x80\x93617 (1961), <i>Bumper</i> v. <i>North Carolina</i>,391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 543, 548, n. 11 (1968).</p><p>Another point seems equally true: just because you <i>have</i> to entrust a third party with your data doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean you should lose all Fourth Amendment protections in it.  Not infrequently one person comes into possession of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s property without the owner\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Think of the finder of lost goods or the policeman who impounds a car.  The law recognizes that the goods and the car still belong to their true owners, for \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a person comes into lawful possession of the personal property of another, even though there is no formal agreement between the property\xe2\x80\x99s owner and its possessor, the possessor will become a constructive bailee when justice so requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Christensen</i> v. <i>Hoover</i>, 643 P. 2d 525, 529 (Colo. 1982) (en banc); Laidlaw, Principles of Bailment, 16 Cornell L. Q. 286 (1931).  At least some of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have already suggested that use of technology is functionally compelled by the demands of modern life, and in that way the fact that we store data with third parties may amount to a sort of involuntary bailment too.  See <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (majority opinion); <i>Riley</i> v. <i>California</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9).</p><p><i>Third</i>, positive law may help provide detailed guidance on evolving technologies without resort to judicial intuition.  State (or sometimes federal) law often creates rights in both tangible and intangible things.  See <i>Ruckelshaus</i> v. <i>Monsanto Co.</i>,467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 986, 1001 (1984).  In the context of the Takings Clause we often ask whether those state-created rights are sufficient to make something someone\xe2\x80\x99s property for constitutional purposes.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1001\xe2\x80\x931003; <i>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank</i> v. <i>Radford</i>,295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, 590\xe2\x80\x93595 (1935).  A similar inquiry may be appropriate for the Fourth Amendment.  Both the States and federal government are actively legislating in the area of third party data storage and the rights users enjoy.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Stored Communications Act,18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72701 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>; Tex. Prop. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7111.004(12) (West 2017) (defining \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roperty\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cproperty held in any digital or electronic medium\xe2\x80\x9d).<i> </i>State courts are busy expounding common law property principles in this area as well.  <i>E.g., Ajemian</i> v. <i>Yahoo!, Inc.</i>, 478 Mass. 169, 170, 84 N.\xc2\xa0E. 3d 766, 768 (2017) (e-mail account is a \xe2\x80\x9cform of property often referred to as a \xe2\x80\x98digital asset\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Eysoldt</i> v. <i>ProScan Imaging</i>, 194 Ohio App.\xc2\xa03d 630, 638, 2011\xe2\x80\x93Ohio\xe2\x80\x932359, 957 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 780, 786 (2011) (permitting action for conversion of web account as intangible property).  If state legislators or state courts say that a digital record has the attributes that normally make something property, that may supply a sounder basis for judicial decisionmaking than judicial guesswork about societal expectations.</p><p><i>Fourth</i>, while positive law may help establish a person\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment interest there may be some circumstances where positive law cannot be used to defeat it.  <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Jackson</i> reflects that understanding.  There this Court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o law of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d could authorize letter carriers \xe2\x80\x9cto invade the secrecy of letters.\xe2\x80\x9d  96 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 733.  So the post office couldn\xe2\x80\x99t impose a regulation dictating that those mailing letters surrender all legal interests in them once they\xe2\x80\x99re deposited in a mailbox.  If that is right, <i>Jackson</i> suggests the existence of a constitutional floor below which Fourth Amendment rights may not descend.  Legislatures cannot pass laws declaring your house or papers to be your property except to the extent the police wish to search them without cause.  As the Court has previously explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must \xe2\x80\x98assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 406 (quoting <i>Kyllo</i> v. <i>United States</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, 34 (2001)).  Nor does this mean protecting only the specific rights known at the founding; it means protecting their modern analogues too.  So, for example, while thermal imaging was unknown in 1791, this Court has recognized that using that technology to look inside a home constitutes a Fourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d of that \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d no less than a physical inspection might.  <i>Id.,</i>  at 40.</p><p><i>Fifth</i>, this constitutional floor may, in some instances, bar efforts to circumvent the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection through the use of subpoenas.  No one thinks the government can evade <i>Jackson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on opening sealed letters without a warrant simply by issuing a subpoena to a postmaster for \xe2\x80\x9call letters sent by John Smith\xe2\x80\x9d or, worse, \xe2\x80\x9call letters sent by John Smith concerning a particular transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  So the question courts will confront will be this: What other kinds of records are sufficiently similar to letters in the mail that the same rule should apply?</p><p>It may be that, as an original matter, a subpoena requiring the recipient to produce records wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of as a \xe2\x80\x9csearch or seizure\xe2\x80\x9d by the government implicating the Fourth Amendment, see <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Alito, J.), but instead as an act of compelled self-incrimination implicating the Fifth Amendment, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hubbell</i>,530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, 49\xe2\x80\x9355 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Nagareda, Compulsion \xe2\x80\x9cTo Be a Witness\xe2\x80\x9d and the Resurrection of Boyd, 74 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1575, 1619, and n.\xc2\xa0172 (1999).  But the common law of searches and seizures does not appear to have confronted a case where private documents equivalent to a mailed letter were entrusted to a bailee and then subpoenaed.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he common-law rule regarding subpoenas for documents held by third parties entrusted with information from the target is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unknown and perhaps unknowable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dripps, Perspectives on The Fourth Amendment Forty Years Later: Toward the Realization of an Inclusive Regulatory Model, 100 Minn. L. Rev. 1885, 1922 (2016).  Given that (perhaps insoluble) uncertainty, I am content to adhere to <i>Jackson</i> and its implications for now.</p><p>To be sure, we must be wary of returning to the doctrine of <i>Boyd</i> v. <i>United States</i>,116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616.  <i>Boyd</i> invoked the Fourth Amendment to restrict the use of subpoenas even for ordinary business records and, as Justice Alito notes, eventually proved unworkable.  See <i>ante, </i>at 13 (dissenting opinion); 3 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa78.7(a), pp. 185\xe2\x80\x93187 (4th ed. 2015).  But if we were to overthrow <i>Jackson</i> too and deny Fourth Amendment protection to <i>any </i>subpoenaed materials, we would do well to reconsider the scope of the Fifth Amendment while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it.  Our precedents treat the right against self-incrimination as applicable only to testimony, not the production of incriminating evidence.  See <i>Fisher</i> v. <i>United States</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 391, 401 (1976).  But there is substantial evidence that the privilege against self-incrimination was also originally understood to protect a person from being forced to turn over potentially incriminating evidence.  Nagareda, <i>supra,</i> at 1605\xe2\x80\x931623; <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Purnell</i>, 96 Eng. Rep. 20 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1748); Slobogin, Privacy at Risk 145 (2007).</p><p>*</p><p>What does all this mean for the case before us?  To start, I cannot fault the Sixth Circuit for holding that <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> extinguish any <i>Katz</i>-based Fourth Amendment interest in third party cell-site data.  That is the plain effect of their categorical holdings.  Nor can I fault the Court today for its implicit but unmistakable conclusion that the rationale of <i>Smith </i>and <i>Miller </i>is wrong; indeed, I agree with that.  The Sixth Circuit was powerless to say so, but this Court can and should.  At the same time, I do not agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today to keep <i>Smith</i> and <i>Miller</i> on life support and supplement them with a new and multilayered inquiry that seems to be only <i>Katz</i>-squared.  Returning there, I worry, promises more trouble than help.  Instead, I would look to a more traditional Fourth Amendment approach.  Even if <i>Katz</i> may still supply one way to prove a Fourth Amendment interest, it has never been the only way.  Neglecting more traditional approaches may mean failing to vindicate the full protections of the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Our case offers a cautionary example.  It seems to me entirely possible a person\xe2\x80\x99s cell-site data could qualify as <i>his</i> papers or effects under existing law.  Yes, the telephone carrier holds the information.  But47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222 designates a customer\xe2\x80\x99s cell-site location information as \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer proprietary network information\xe2\x80\x9d (CPNI), \xc2\xa7222(h)(1)(A), and gives customers certain rights to control use of and access to CPNI about themselves.  The statute generally forbids a carrier to \xe2\x80\x9cuse, disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable\xe2\x80\x9d CPNI without the customer\xe2\x80\x99s consent, except as needed to provide the customer\xe2\x80\x99s telecommunications services.  \xc2\xa7222(c)(1).  It also requires the carrier to disclose CPNI \xe2\x80\x9cupon affirmative written request by the customer, to any person designated by the customer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7222(c)(2).  Congress even afforded customers a private cause of action for damages against carriers who violate the Act\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  \xc2\xa7207.  Plainly, customers have substantial legal interests in this information, including at least some right to include, exclude, and control its use.  Those interests might even rise to the level of a property right.</p><p>The problem is that we do not know anything more.  Before the district court and court of appeals, Mr. Carpenter pursued only a <i>Katz</i> \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectations\xe2\x80\x9d argument.  He did not invoke the law of property or any analogies to the common law, either there or in his petition for certiorari.  Even in his merits brief before this Court, Mr. Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of his positive law rights in cell-site data was cursory.  He offered no analysis, for example, of what rights state law might provide him in addition to those supplied by \xc2\xa7222.  In these circumstances, I cannot help but conclude\xe2\x80\x94reluctantly\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Carpenter forfeited perhaps his most promising line of argument.</p><p>Unfortunately, too, this case marks the second time this Term that individuals have forfeited Fourth Amendment arguments based on positive law by failing to preserve them.  See <i>Byrd</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  Litigants have had fair notice since at least <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i> (2012) and <i>Florida </i>v. <i>Jardines</i> (2013) that arguments like these may vindicate Fourth Amendment interests even where <i>Katz</i> arguments do not.  Yet the arguments have gone unmade, leaving courts to the usual <i>Katz</i> hand- waving.  These omissions do not serve the development  of a sound or fully protective Fourth Amendment  jurisprudence.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3919268">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x93402</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">TIMOTHY IVORY CARPENTER, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 22, 2018]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern about the effect of new technology on personal privacy, but I fear that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will do far more harm than good.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of\n \nFourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Court ignores the basic distinction between an actual search (dispatching law enforcement officers to enter private premises and root through private papers and effects) and an order merely requiring a party to look through its own records and produce specified documents.  The former, which intrudes on personal privacy far more deeply, requires probable cause; the latter does not.  Treating an order to produce like an actual search, as today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does, is revolutionary.  It violates both the original understanding of the\n \nFourth Amendment and more than a century of Supreme Court precedent.  Unless it is somehow restricted to the particular situation in the present case, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s move will cause upheaval.  Must every grand jury subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> be supported by probable cause?  If so, investigations of terrorism, political corruption, white-collar crime, and many other offenses will be stymied.  And what about subpoenas and other document-production orders issued by administrative agencies?  See, <i>e.g.</i>,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa757b\xe2\x80\x931(c) (Federal Trade Commission); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777s(c), 78u(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) (Securities and Exchange Commission);\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7657(b) (Occupational Safety and Health Administration); 29 CFR \xc2\xa71601.16(a)(2) (2017) (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court allows a defendant to object to the search of a third party\xe2\x80\x99s property.  This also is revolutionary.  The\n \nFourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in <i>their </i>persons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), not the persons, houses, papers, and effects of others.  Until today, we have been careful to heed this fundamental feature of the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text.  This was true when the\n \nFourth Amendment was tied to property law, and it remained true after <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967), broadened the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By departing dramatically from these fundamental principles, the Court destabilizes long-established\n \nFourth Amendment doctrine.  We will be making repairs\xe2\x80\x94or picking up the pieces\xe2\x80\x94for a long time to come.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today the majority holds that a court order requiring the production of cell-site records may be issued only after the Government demonstrates probable cause.  See <i>ante</i>, at 18.  That is a serious and consequential mistake.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is based on the premise that the order issued in this case was an actual \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the\n \nFourth Amendment, but that premise is inconsistent with the original meaning of the\n \nFourth Amendment and with more than a century of precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The order in this case was the functional equivalent of a subpoena for documents, and there is no evidence that these writs were regarded as \xe2\x80\x9csearches\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the founding.  Subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> and other forms of compulsory document production were well known to the founding generation.  Blackstone dated the first writ of subpoena to the reign of King Richard II in the late 14th century, and by the end of the 15th century, the use of such writs had \xe2\x80\x9cbecome the daily practice of the [Chancery] court.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 53 (G. Tucker ed. 1803) (Blackstone).  Over the next 200 years, subpoenas would grow in prominence and power in tandem with the Court of Chancery, and by the end of Charles II\xe2\x80\x99s reign in 1685, two important innovations had occurred.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Court of Chancery developed a new species of subpoena.  Until this point, subpoenas had been used largely to compel attendance and oral testimony from witnesses; these subpoenas correspond to today\xe2\x80\x99s subpoenas <i>ad testificandum</i>.  But the Court of Chancery also improvised a new version of the writ that tacked onto a regular subpoena an order compelling the witness to bring certain items with him.  By issuing these so-called subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i>, the Court of Chancery could compel the production of papers, books, and other forms of physical evidence, whether from the parties to the case or from third parties.  Such subpoenas were sufficiently commonplace by 1623 that a leading treatise on the practice of law could refer in passing to the fee for a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Sub p\xc5\x93na </i>of <i>Ducas tecum</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (seven shillings and two pence) without needing to elaborate further.  T. Powell, The Attourneys Academy 79 (1623).  Subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> would swell in use over the next century as the rules for their application became ever more developed and definite.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>1 G. Jacob, The Compleat Chancery-Practiser 290 (1730) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <i>Subpoena duces tecum</i> is awarded when the Defendant has confessed by his Answer that he hath such Writings in his Hands as are prayed by the Bill to be discovered or brought into Court\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, although this new species of subpoena had its origins in the Court of Chancery, it soon made an appearance in the work of the common-law courts as well.  One court later reported that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Courts of Common law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. employed the same or similar means .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the time of Charles the Second at least.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Amey</i> v. <i>Long</i>, 9 East. 473, 484, 103 Eng. Rep. 653, 658 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1808).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By the time Blackstone published his Commentaries on the Laws of England in the 1760\xe2\x80\x99s, the use of subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> had bled over substantially from the courts of equity to the common-law courts.  Admittedly, the transition was still incomplete: In the context of jury trials, for example, Blackstone complained about \xe2\x80\x9cthe want of a compulsive power for the production of books and papers belonging to the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blackstone 381; see also, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Entick</i> v. <i>Carrington</i>, 19 State Trials 1029, 1073 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1765) (\xe2\x80\x9cI wish some cases had been shewn, where the law forceth evidence out of the owner\xe2\x80\x99s custody by process.  [But] where the adversary has by force or fraud got possession of your own proper evidence, there is no way to get it back but by action\xe2\x80\x9d).  But Blackstone found some comfort in the fact that at least those documents \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the hands of third persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. can generally be obtained by rule of court, or by adding a clause of requisition to the writ of <i>subpoena</i>, which is then called a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blackstone 381; see also, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Leeds</i> v. <i>Cook</i>, 4 Esp. 256, 257, 170 Eng. Rep. 711 (N.\xc2\xa0P. 1803) (third-party subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>); <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Babb</i>, 3 T.\xc2\xa0R. 579, 580, 100 Eng. Rep. 743, 744 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1790) (third-party document production).  One of the primary questions outstanding, then, was whether common-law courts would remedy the \xe2\x80\x9cdefect[s]\xe2\x80\x9d identified by the Commentaries, and allow parties to use subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> not only with respect to third parties but also with respect to each other.  Blackstone 381.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That question soon found an affirmative answer on both sides of the Atlantic.  In the United States, the First Congress established the federal court system in the Judiciary Act of 1789.  As part of that Act, Congress authorized \xe2\x80\x9call the said courts of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the trial of actions at law, on motion and due notice thereof being given, to require the parties to produce books or writings in their possession or power, which contain evidence pertinent to the issue, in cases and under circumstances where they might be compelled to produce the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa715,\n\n1Stat.\n82.  From that point forward, federal courts in the United States could compel the production of documents regardless of whether those documents were held by parties to the case or by third parties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In Great Britain, too, it was soon definitively established that common-law courts, like their counterparts in equity, could subpoena documents held either by parties to the case or by third parties.  After proceeding in fits and starts, the King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench eventually held in <i>Amey</i> v. <i>Long</i> that the \xe2\x80\x9cwrit of subp\xc5\x93na duces tecum [is] a writ of compulsory obligation and effect in the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 East., at 486, 103 Eng. Rep., at 658.  Writing for a unanimous court, Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right to resort to means competent to compel the production of written, as well as oral, testimony seems essential to the very existence and constitution of a Court of Common Law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 484, 103 Eng. Rep., at 658.  Without the power to issue subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i>, the Lord Chief Justice observed, common-law courts \xe2\x80\x9ccould not possibly proceed with due effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The prevalence of subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> at the time of the founding was not limited to the civil context.  In criminal cases, courts and prosecutors were also using the writ to compel the production of necessary documents.  In <i>Rex </i>v. <i>Dixon</i>, 3 Burr. 1687, 97 Eng. Rep. 1047 (K. B. 1765), for example, the King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench considered the propriety of a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> served on an attorney named Samuel Dixon.  Dixon had been called \xe2\x80\x9cto give evidence before the grand jury of the county of Northampton\xe2\x80\x9d and specifically \xe2\x80\x9cto produce three vouchers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in order to found a prosecution by way of indictment against [his client] Peach .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for forgery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1687, 97 Eng. Rep., at 1047\xe2\x80\x931048.  Although the court ultimately held that Dixon had not needed to produce the vouchers on account of attorney-client privilege, none of the justices expressed the slightest doubt about the general propriety of subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> in the criminal context.  See <i>id.,</i> at 1688, 97 Eng. Rep., at 1048.  As Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough later explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n that case no objection was taken to the writ, but to the special circumstances under which the party possessed the papers; so that the Court may be considered as recognizing the general obligation to obey writs of that description in other cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Amey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 485, 103 Eng. Rep., at 658; see also 4 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 185 (1816) (template for criminal subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As <i>Dixon </i>shows, subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> were routine in part because of their close association with grand juries.  Early American colonists imported the grand jury, like so many other common-law traditions, and they quickly flourished.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Calandra</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338, 342\xe2\x80\x93343 (1974).  Grand juries were empaneled by the federal courts almost as soon as the latter were established, and both they and their state counterparts actively exercised their wide-ranging common-law authority.  See R. Younger, The People\xe2\x80\x99s Panel 47\xe2\x80\x9355 (1963).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Founders thought the grand jury so essential .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that they provided in the\n \nFifth Amendment that federal prosecution for serious crimes can only be instituted by \xe2\x80\x98a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Calandra</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 343.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the popularity and prevalence of grand juries at the time, the Founders must have been intimately familiar with the tools they used\xe2\x80\x94including compulsory process\xe2\x80\x94to accomplish their work.  As a matter of tradition, grand juries were \xe2\x80\x9caccorded wide latitude to inquire into violations of criminal law,\xe2\x80\x9d including the power to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as [they] conside[r] appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Long before national independence was achieved, grand juries were already using their broad inquisitorial powers not only to present and indict criminal suspects but also to inspect public buildings, to levy taxes, to supervise the administration of the laws, to advance municipal reforms such as street repair and bridge maintenance, and in some cases even to propose legislation.  Younger, <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9326.  Of course, such work depended entirely on grand juries\xe2\x80\x99 ability to access any relevant documents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Grand juries continued to exercise these broad inquisitorial powers up through the time of the founding.  See <i>Blair</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n250 U.\xc2\xa0S. 273, 280 (1919) (\xe2\x80\x9cAt the foundation of our Federal Government the inquisitorial function of the grand jury and the compulsion of witnesses were recognized as incidents of the judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d).  In a series of lectures delivered in the early 1790\xe2\x80\x99s, Justice James Wilson crowed that grand juries were \xe2\x80\x9cthe peculiar boast of the common law\xe2\x80\x9d thanks in part to their wide-ranging authority: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the operations of government, and of its ministers and officers, are within the compass of their view and research.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 J. Wilson, The Works of James Wilson 534, 537 (R. McCloskey ed. 1967).  That reflected the broader insight that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s investigative power must be broad if its public responsibility is adequately to be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Calandra</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 344.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compulsory process was also familiar to the founding generation in part because it reflected \xe2\x80\x9cthe ancient proposition of law\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe public .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has a right to every man\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nixon</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683, 709 (1974); see also <i>ante</i>, at 10 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  As early as 1612, \xe2\x80\x9cLord Bacon is reported to have declared that \xe2\x80\x98all subjects, without distinction of degrees, owe to the King tribute and service, not only of their deed and hand, but of their knowledge and discovery.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Blair</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 279\xe2\x80\x93280.  That duty could be \xe2\x80\x9conerous at times,\xe2\x80\x9d yet the Founders considered it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to the administration of justice according to the forms and modes established in our system of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 281; see also <i>Calandra</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 345.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Talk of kings and common-law writs may seem out of place in a case about cell-site records and the protections afforded by the\n \nFourth Amendment in the modern age.  But this history matters, not least because it tells us what was on the minds of those who ratified the\n \nFourth Amendment and how they understood its scope.  That history makes it abundantly clear that the\n \nFourth Amendment, as originally understood, did not apply to the compulsory production of documents at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The\n \nFourth Amendment does not regulate all methods by which the Government obtains documents.  Rather, it prohibits only those \xe2\x80\x9csearches and seizures\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Consistent with that language, \xe2\x80\x9cat least until the latter half of the 20th century\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cour\n \nFourth Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 405 (2012).  So by its terms, the\n \nFourth Amendment does not apply to the compulsory production of documents, a practice that involves neither any physical intrusion into private space nor any taking of property by agents of the state.  Even Justice Brandeis\xe2\x80\x94a stalwart proponent of construing the\n \nFourth Amendment liberally\xe2\x80\x94acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cunder any ordinary construction of language,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no \xe2\x80\x98search\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98seizure\xe2\x80\x99 when a defendant is required to produce a document in the orderly process of a court\xe2\x80\x99s procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Olmstead</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438, 476 (1928) (dissenting opinion).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor is there any reason to believe that the Founders intended the\n \nFourth Amendment to regulate courts\xe2\x80\x99 use of compulsory process.  American colonists rebelled against the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s physical invasions of their persons and their property, not against its acquisition of information by any and all means.  As Justice Black once put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFourth Amendment was aimed directly at the abhorred practice of breaking in, ransacking and searching homes and other buildings and seizing people\xe2\x80\x99s personal belongings without warrants issued by magistrates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Katz</i>, 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 367 (dissenting opinion).  More recently, we have acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment was the founding generation\xe2\x80\x99s response to the reviled \xe2\x80\x98general warrants\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98writs of assistance\xe2\x80\x99 of the colonial era, which allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i> v. <i>California</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 27).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">General warrants and writs of assistance were noxious not because they allowed the Government to acquire evidence in criminal investigations, but because of the <i>means</i> by which they permitted the Government to acquire that evidence.  Then, as today, searches could be quite invasive.  Searches generally begin with officers \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] nonconsensual entries into areas not open to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Donovan</i> v. <i>Lone Steer, Inc.</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408, 414 (1984).  Once there, officers are necessarily in a position to observe private spaces generally shielded from the public and discernible only with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Private area after private area becomes exposed to the officers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes as they rummage through the owner\xe2\x80\x99s property in their hunt for the object or objects of the search.  If they are searching for documents, officers may additionally have to rifle through many other papers\xe2\x80\x94potentially filled with the most intimate details of a person\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and life\xe2\x80\x94before they find the specific information they are seeking.  See <i>Andresen</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463, 482, n.\xc2\xa011 (1976).  If anything sufficiently incriminating comes into view, officers seize it.  <i>Horton</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (1990).  Physical destruction always lurks as an underlying possibility; \xe2\x80\x9cofficers executing search warrants on occasion must damage property in order to perform their duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dalia</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, 258 (1979); see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> United States</i> v. <i>Ramirez</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 65, 71\xe2\x80\x9372 (1998) (breaking garage window);<i> United States</i> v. <i>Ross</i>,\n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 798, 817\xe2\x80\x93818 (1982) (ripping open car upholstery); <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Battle Creek Police Dept.</i>, 844 F.\xc2\xa03d 556, 572 (CA6 2016) (shooting and killing two pet dogs); <i>Lawmaster</i> v. <i>Ward</i>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 1341, 1350, n.\xc2\xa03 (CA10 1997) (breaking locks).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compliance with a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> requires none of that.  A subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> permits a subpoenaed individual to conduct the search for the relevant documents himself, without law enforcement officers entering his home or rooting through his papers and effects.  As a result, subpoenas avoid the many incidental invasions of privacy that necessarily accompany any actual search.  And it was <i>those </i>invasions of privacy\xe2\x80\x94which, although incidental, could often be extremely intrusive and damaging\xe2\x80\x94that led to the adoption of the\n \nFourth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither this Court nor any of the parties have offered the slightest bit of historical evidence to support the idea that the\n \nFourth Amendment originally applied to subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> and other forms of compulsory process.  That is telling, for as I have explained, these forms of compulsory process were a feature of criminal (and civil) procedure well known to the Founders.  The Founders would thus have understood that holding the compulsory production of documents to the same standard as actual searches and seizures would cripple the work of courts in civil and criminal cases alike.  It would be remarkable to think that, despite that knowledge, the Founders would have gone ahead and sought to impose such a requirement.  It would be even more incredible to believe that the Founders would have imposed that requirement through the inapt vehicle of an amendment directed at different concerns.  But it would blink reality entirely to argue that this entire process happened without anyone saying <i>the least thing about it</i>\xe2\x80\x94not during the drafting of the Bill of Rights, not during any of the subsequent ratification debates, and not for most of the century that followed.  If the Founders thought the\n \nFourth Amendment applied to the compulsory production of documents, one would imagine that there would be <i>some</i> founding-era evidence of the\n \nFourth Amendment being applied to the compulsory production of documents.  Cf. <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> v. <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, 505 (2010); <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 898, 905 (1997).  Yet none has been brought to our attention.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Of course, our jurisprudence has not stood still since 1791.  We now evaluate subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> and other forms of compulsory document production under the\n \nFourth Amendment, although we employ a reasonableness standard that is less demanding than the requirements for a warrant.  But the road to that doctrinal destination was anything but smooth, and our initial missteps\xe2\x80\x94and the subsequent struggle to extricate ourselves from their consequences\xe2\x80\x94should provide an object lesson for today\xe2\x80\x99s majority about the dangers of holding compulsory process to the same standard as actual searches and seizures.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For almost a century after the\n \nFourth Amendment was enacted, this Court said and did nothing to indicate that it might regulate the compulsory production of documents.  But that changed temporarily when the Court decided <i>Boyd</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616 (1886), the first\xe2\x80\x94and, until today, the only\xe2\x80\x94case in which this Court has ever held the compulsory production of documents to the same standard as actual searches and seizures.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Boyd</i> Court held that a court order compelling a company to produce potentially incriminating business records violated both the Fourth and the\n \nFifth Amendments.  The Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain aggravating incidents of actual search and seizure, such as forcible entry into a man\xe2\x80\x99s house and searching amongst his papers, are wanting\xe2\x80\x9d when the Government relies on compulsory process.  <i>Id.</i>, at 622.  But it nevertheless asserted that the\n \nFourth Amendment ought to \xe2\x80\x9cbe liberally construed,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 635, and further reasoned that compulsory process \xe2\x80\x9ceffects the sole object and purpose of search and seizure\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cforcing from a party evidence against himself,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 622.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn this regard,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fourth and\n \nFifth Amendments run almost into each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 630.  Having equated compulsory process with actual searches and seizures and having melded the\n \nFourth Amendment with the Fifth, the Court then found the order at issue unconstitutional because it compelled the production of property to which the Government did not have superior title.  See <i>id.</i>, at 622\xe2\x80\x93630.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a concurrence joined by Chief Justice Waite, Justice Miller agreed that the order violated the\n \nFifth Amendment, <i>id.</i>, at 639, but he strongly protested the majority\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  He explained: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no reason why this court should assume that the action of the court below, in requiring a party to produce certain papers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , authorizes an unreasonable search or seizure of the house, papers, or effects of that party.  There is in fact no search and no seizure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the mere service of a notice to produce a paper .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a search,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Miller concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthen a change has taken place in the meaning of words, which has not come within my reading, and which I think was unknown at the time the Constitution was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 641.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although <i>Boyd</i> was replete with stirring rhetoric, its reasoning was confused from start to finish in a way that ultimately made the decision unworkable.  See 3 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa78.7(a) (4th ed. 2015).  Over the next 50 years, the Court would gradually roll back <i>Boyd</i>\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous conflation of compulsory process with actual searches and seizures.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That effort took its first significant stride in <i>Hale</i> v. <i>Henkel</i>,\n\n201 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43 (1906), where the Court found it \xe2\x80\x9cquite clear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe search and seizure clause of the\n \nFourth Amendment was not intended to interfere with the power of courts to compel, through a <i>subp\xc5\x93na duces tecum</i>, the production, upon a trial in court, of documentary evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 73.  Without that writ, the Court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be \xe2\x80\x98utterly impossible to carry on the administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> <i>Hale</i>, however,<i> </i>did not entirely liberate subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> from\n \nFourth Amendment constraints.  While refusing to treat such subpoenas as the equivalent of actual searches, <i>Hale</i> concluded that they must not be unreasonable.  And it held that the subpoena<i> duces tecum</i> at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cfar too sweeping in its terms to be regarded as reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 76.  The <i>Hale</i> Court thus left two critical questions unanswered: Under the\n \nFourth Amendment, what makes the compulsory production of documents \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and how does that standard differ from the one that governs actual searches and seizures?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court answered both of those questions definitively in <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>Walling</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186 (1946), where we held that the\n \nFourth Amendment regulates the compelled production of documents, but less stringently than it does full-blown searches and seizures.  <i>Oklahoma Press</i> began by admitting that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions on the subject had \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps too often .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. been generative of heat rather than light,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmov[ing] with variant direction\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes having \xe2\x80\x9chighly contrasting\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cemphasis and tone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 202.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe primary source of misconception concerning the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s function\xe2\x80\x9d in this context, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9clies perhaps in the identification of cases involving so-called \xe2\x80\x98figurative\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98constructive\xe2\x80\x99 search with cases of actual search and seizure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic distinction\xe2\x80\x9d between the compulsory production of documents on the one hand, and actual searches and seizures on the other, meant that two different standards had to be applied.  <i>Id.,</i> at 204.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Having reversed <i>Boyd</i>\xe2\x80\x99s conflation of the compelled production of documents with actual searches and seizures, the Court then set forth the relevant\n \nFourth Amendment standard for the former.  When it comes to \xe2\x80\x9cthe production of corporate or other business records,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that the\n \nFourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cat the most guards against abuse only by way of too much indefiniteness or breadth in the things required to be \xe2\x80\x98particularly described,\xe2\x80\x99 if also the inquiry is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials specified are relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 208.  Notably, the Court held that a showing of probable cause was not necessary so long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation is authorized by Congress, is for a purpose Congress can order, and the documents sought are relevant to the inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 209.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, we have consistently hewed to that standard.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Lone Steer, Inc.</i>, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 414\xe2\x80\x93415; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435, 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (1976); <i>California Bankers Assn.</i> v. <i>Shultz</i>,\n\n416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21, 67 (1974); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dionisio</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (1973); <i>See</i> v. <i>Seattle</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 541, 544 (1967); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,\n\n379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 48, 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (1964); <i>McPhaul</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 372, 382\xe2\x80\x93383 (1960); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton Salt Co.</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 632, 652\xe2\x80\x93653 (1950); cf. <i>McLane Co.</i> v. <i>EEOC</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 11).  By applying <i>Oklahoma Press</i> and thereby respecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe traditional distinction between a search warrant and a subpoena,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 446, this Court has reinforced \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic compromise\xe2\x80\x9d between \xe2\x80\x9cthe public interest\xe2\x80\x9d in every man\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and the private interest \xe2\x80\x9cof men to be free from officious meddling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 213.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today, however, the majority inexplicably ignores the settled rule of <i>Oklahoma Press</i> in favor of a resurrected version of <i>Boyd</i>.  That is mystifying.  This should have been an easy case regardless of whether the Court looked to the original understanding of the\n \nFourth Amendment or to our modern doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a matter of original understanding, the Fourth Amendment does not regulate the compelled production of documents at all.  Here the Government received the relevant cell-site records pursuant to a court order compelling Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell service provider to turn them over.  That process is thus immune from challenge under the original understanding of the\n \nFourth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a matter of modern doctrine, this case is equally straightforward.  As Justice Kennedy explains, no search or seizure of Carpenter or his property occurred in this case.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x9322; see also Part II, <i>infra</i>.  But even if the majority were right that the Government \xe2\x80\x9csearched\xe2\x80\x9d Carpenter, it would at most be a \xe2\x80\x9cfigurative or constructive search\xe2\x80\x9d governed by the <i>Oklahoma Press</i> standard, not an \xe2\x80\x9cactual search\xe2\x80\x9d controlled by the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s warrant requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And there is no doubt that the Government met the <i>Oklahoma Press</i> standard here.  Under <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, a court order must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lone Steer, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 415.  Here, the type of order obtained by the Government almost necessarily satisfies that standard.  The Stored Communications Act allows a court to issue the relevant type of order \xe2\x80\x9conly if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the records .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sough[t] are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  And the court \xe2\x80\x9cmay quash or modify such order\xe2\x80\x9d if the provider objects that the \xe2\x80\x9crecords requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an undue burden on such provider.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  No such objection was made in this case, and Carpenter does not suggest that the orders contravened the <i>Oklahoma Press</i> standard in any other way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is what makes the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion so puzzling.  It decides that a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d of Carpenter occurred within the meaning of the\n \nFourth Amendment, but then it leaps straight to imposing requirements that\xe2\x80\x94until this point\xe2\x80\x94have governed only <i>actual</i> searches and seizures.  See <i>ante</i>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Lost in its race to the finish is any real recognition of the century\xe2\x80\x99s worth of precedent it jeopardizes.  For the majority, this case is apparently no different from one in which Government agents raided Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s home and removed records associated with his cell phone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Against centuries of precedent and practice, all that the Court can muster is the observation that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court has never held that the Government may subpoena third parties for records in which the suspect has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 19.  Frankly, I cannot imagine a concession more damning to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument than that.  As the Court well knows, the reason that we have never seen such a case is because\xe2\x80\x94until today\xe2\x80\x94defendants categorically had no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d and no property interest in records belonging to third parties.  See Part II, <i>infra</i>.  By implying otherwise, the Court tries the nice trick of seeking shelter under the cover of precedents that it simultaneously perforates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not only that, but even if the\n \nFourth Amendment permitted someone to object to the subpoena of a third party\xe2\x80\x99s records, the Court cannot explain why that individual should be entitled to <i>greater</i>\n \nFourth Amendment protection than the party actually being subpoenaed.  When parties are subpoenaed to turn over their records, after all, they will at most receive the protection afforded by <i>Oklahoma Press</i> even though they will own and have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the records at issue.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, the\n \nFourth Amendment will extend greater protections to someone else who is not being subpoenaed and does not own the records.  That outcome makes no sense, and the Court does not even attempt to defend it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have set forth the relevant\n \nFourth Amendment standard for subpoenaing business records many times over.  Out of those dozens of cases, the majority cannot find even one that so much as suggests an exception to the <i>Oklahoma Press</i> standard for sufficiently personal information.  Instead, we have always \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed the constitutional requirements\xe2\x80\x9d for compulsory process as being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and as applying categorically to all \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subpoenas [of] corporate books or records.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lone Steer, Inc.</i>, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 415 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That standard, we have held, is \xe2\x80\x9c<i>the most</i>\xe2\x80\x9d protection the\n \nFourth Amendment gives \xe2\x80\x9cto the production of corporate records and papers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, 327 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 208 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the majority announces its holding in the context of the Stored Communications Act, nothing stops its logic from sweeping much further.  The Court has offered no meaningful limiting principle, and none is apparent.  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel admitting that \xe2\x80\x9ca grand jury subpoena .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would be held to the same standard as any other subpoena or subpoena-like request for [cell-site] records\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holding that subpoenas must meet the same standard as conventional searches will seriously damage, if not destroy, their utility.  Even more so than at the founding, today the Government regularly uses subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> and other forms of compulsory process to carry out its essential functions.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Dionisio</i>, 410 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (grand jury subpoenas); <i>McPhaul</i>, 364 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 382\xe2\x80\x93383 (legislative subpoenas); <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 208\xe2\x80\x93209 (administrative subpoenas).  Grand juries, for example, have long \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[led] the production of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in order to determine \xe2\x80\x9c<i>whether</i> there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Calandra</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 343 (emphasis added).  Almost by definition, then, grand juries will be unable at first to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9cthe probable cause required for a warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 19 (majority opinion); see also <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 213.  If they are required to do so, the effects are as predictable as they are alarming: Many investigations will sputter out at the start, and a host of criminals will be able to evade law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cTo ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nixon</i>, 418 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 709.  For over a hundred years, we have understood that holding subpoenas to the same standard as actual searches and seizures \xe2\x80\x9cwould stop much if not all of investigation in the public interest at the threshold of inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 213.  Today a skeptical majority decides to put that understanding to the test.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Compounding its initial error, the Court also holds that a defendant has the right under the\n \nFourth Amendment to object to the search of a third party\xe2\x80\x99s property.  This holding flouts the clear text of the\n \nFourth Amendment, and it cannot be defended under either a property-based interpretation of that Amendment or our decisions applying the reasonable-expectations-of-privacy test adopted in <i>Katz</i>,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347.  By allowing Carpenter to object to the search of a third party\xe2\x80\x99s property, the Court threatens to revolutionize a second and independent line of\n \nFourth Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It bears repeating that the\n \nFourth Amendment guarantees \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in <i>their</i> persons, houses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The\n \nFourth Amendment does not confer rights with respect to the persons, houses, papers, and effects of others.  Its language makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFourth Amendment rights are personal,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Rakas</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 140 (1978), and as a result, this Court has long insisted that they \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be asserted vicariously,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 133.  It follows that a \xe2\x80\x9cperson who is aggrieved .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person\xe2\x80\x99s premises or property has not had any of his\n \nFourth Amendment rights infringed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 134.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, as Justice Kennedy cogently explains, the cell-site records obtained by the Government belong to Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell service providers, not to Carpenter.  See <i>ante</i>,<i> </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Carpenter did not create the cell-site records.  Nor did he have possession of them; at all relevant times, they were kept by the providers.  Once Carpenter subscribed to his provider\xe2\x80\x99s service, he had no right to prevent the company from creating or keeping the information in its records.  Carpenter also had no right to demand that the providers destroy the records, no right to prevent the providers from destroying the records, and, indeed, no right to modify the records in any way whatsoever (or to prevent the providers from modifying the records).  Carpenter, in short, has no meaningful control over the cell-site records, which are created, maintained, altered, used, and eventually destroyed by his cell service providers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Carpenter responds by pointing to a provision of the Telecommunications Act that requires a provider to disclose cell-site records when a customer so requests.  See\n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222(c)(2).  But a statutory disclosure requirement is hardly sufficient to give someone an ownership interest in the documents that must be copied and disclosed.  Many statutes confer a right to obtain copies of documents without creating any property right.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">  Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s argument is particularly hard to swallow because nothing in the Telecommunications Act precludes cell service providers from charging customers a fee for accessing cell-site records.  See <i>ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  It would be very strange if the owner of records were required to pay in order to inspect his own property.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the Telecommunications Act give Carpenter a property right in the cell-site records simply because they are subject to confidentiality restrictions.  See\n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222(c)(1) (without a customer\xe2\x80\x99s  permission,  a cell service provider may generally \xe2\x80\x9cuse, disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable [cell-site records]\xe2\x80\x9d only with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cits provision\xe2\x80\x9d of telecommunications services).  Many federal statutes impose similar restrictions on private entities\xe2\x80\x99 use or dissemination of information in their own records without conferring a property right on third parties.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It would be especially strange to hold that the Telecommunication Act\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality provision confers a property right when the Act creates an express exception for any disclosure of records that is \xe2\x80\x9crequired by law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222(c)(1).  So not only does Carpenter lack \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the most essential and beneficial\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constituent elements\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of property, <i>Dickman </i>v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330, 336 (1984)\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, the right to use the property to the exclusion of others\xe2\x80\x94but he cannot even exclude the party he would most like to keep out, namely, the Government.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all these reasons, there is no plausible ground for maintaining that the information at issue here represents Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpapers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceffects.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the days when this Court followed an exclusively property-based approach to the\n \nFourth Amendment, the distinction between an individual\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment rights and those of a third party was clear cut.  We first asked whether the object of the search\xe2\x80\x94say, a house, papers, or effects\xe2\x80\x94belonged to the defendant, and, if it did, whether the Government had committed a \xe2\x80\x9ctrespass\xe2\x80\x9d in acquiring the evidence at issue.  <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 411, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the Court held in <i>Katz</i> that \xe2\x80\x9cproperty rights are not the sole measure of\n \nFourth Amendment violations,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Soldal</i> v. <i>Cook County</i>,\n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56, 64 (1992), the sharp boundary between personal and third-party rights was tested.  Under <i>Katz</i>, a party may invoke the\n \nFourth Amendment whenever law enforcement officers violate the party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d expectation of privacy.  See 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353; see also <i>id.</i>, at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring) (applying the\n \nFourth Amendment where \xe2\x80\x9ca person [has] exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d and where that \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation [is] one that society is prepared to recognize as \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus freed from the limitations imposed by property law, parties began to argue that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in items owned by others.  After all, if a trusted third party took care not to disclose information about the person in question, that person might well have a reasonable expectation that the information would not be revealed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Efforts to claim\n \nFourth Amendment protection against searches of the papers and effects of others came to a head in <i>Miller</i>,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435, where the defendant sought the suppression of two banks\xe2\x80\x99 microfilm copies of his checks, deposit slips, and other records.  The defendant did not claim that he owned these documents, but he nonetheless argued that \xe2\x80\x9canalysis of ownership, property rights and possessory interests in the determination of Fourth Amendment rights ha[d] been severely impeached\xe2\x80\x9d by <i>Katz</i> and other recent cases.  See Brief for Respondent in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>, O. T. 1975, No. 74\xe2\x80\x931179, p.\xc2\xa06.  Turning to <i>Katz</i>, he then argued that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the banks\xe2\x80\x99 records regarding his accounts.  Brief for Respondent in No. 74\xe2\x80\x931179, at 6; see also <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 442\xe2\x80\x93443.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Acceptance of this argument would have flown in the face of the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, and the Court rejected that development.  Because Miller gave up \xe2\x80\x9cdominion and control\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant information to his bank, <i>Rakas,</i> 439 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 149, the Court ruled that he lost any protected\n \nFourth Amendment interest in that information.  See <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 442\xe2\x80\x93443.  Later, in <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, 745 (1979), the Court reached a similar conclusion regarding a telephone company\xe2\x80\x99s records of a customer\xe2\x80\x99s calls.  As Justice Kennedy concludes, <i>Miller </i>and <i>Smith</i> are thus best understood as placing \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary limits on the ability of individuals to assert\n \nFourth Amendment interests in property to which they lack a \xe2\x80\x98requisite connection.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same is true here, where Carpenter indisputably lacks any meaningful property-based connection to the cell-site records owned by his provider.  Because the records are not Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s in any sense, Carpenter may not seek to use the\n \nFourth Amendment to exclude them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By holding otherwise, the Court effectively allows Carpenter to object to the \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d of a third party\xe2\x80\x99s property, not recognizing the revolutionary nature of this change.  The Court seems to think that <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> invented a new \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe third-party doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the Court refuses to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d this product of the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s to a new age of digital communications.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11, 17.  But the Court fundamentally misunderstands the role of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  Those decisions did not forge a new doctrine; instead, they rejected an argument that would have disregarded the clear text of the\n \nFourth Amendment and a formidable body of precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the end, the Court never explains how its decision can be squared with the fact that the\n \nFourth Amendment protects only \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in <i>their</i> persons, houses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the majority professes a desire not to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98embarrass the future,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 18, we can guess where today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will lead.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One possibility is that the broad principles that the Court seems to embrace will be applied across the board.  All subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> and all other orders compelling the production of documents will require a demonstration of probable cause, and individuals will be able to claim a protected\n \nFourth Amendment interest in any sensitive personal information about them that is collected and owned by third parties.  Those would be revolutionary developments indeed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The other possibility is that this Court will face the embarrassment of explaining in case after case that the principles on which today\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests are subject to all sorts of qualifications and limitations that have not yet been discovered.  If we take this latter course, we will inevitably end up \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] a crazy quilt of the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 745.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All of this is unnecessary.  In the Stored Communications Act, Congress addressed the specific problem at issue in this case.  The Act restricts the misuse of cell-site records by cell service providers, something that the\n \nFourth Amendment cannot do.  The Act also goes beyond current\n \nFourth Amendment case law in restricting access by law enforcement.  It permits law enforcement officers to acquire cell-site records only if they meet a heightened standard and obtain a court order.  If the American people now think that the Act is inadequate or needs updating, they can turn to their elected representatives to adopt more protective provisions.  Because the collection and storage of cell-site records affects nearly every American, it is unlikely that the question whether the current law requires strengthening will escape Congress\xe2\x80\x99s notice.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Legislation is much preferable to the development of an entirely new body of\n \nFourth Amendment caselaw for many reasons, including the enormous complexity of the subject, the need to respond to rapidly changing technology, and the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope.  The\n \nFourth Amendment restricts the conduct of the Federal Government and the States; it does not apply to private actors.  But today, some of the greatest threats to individual privacy may come from powerful private companies that collect and sometimes misuse vast quantities of data about the lives of ordinary Americans.  If today\xe2\x80\x99s decision encourages the public to think that this Court can protect them from this looming threat to their privacy, the decision will mislead as well as disrupt.  And if holding a provision of the Stored Communications Act to be unconstitutional dissuades Congress from further legislation in this field, the goal of protecting privacy will be greatly disserved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The desire to make a statement about privacy in the digital age does not justify the consequences that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is likely to produce.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Any other interpretation of the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text would run into insuperable problems because it would apply not only to subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i> but to all other forms of compulsory process as well.

It should turn, instead, on <i>whose </i>property was searched.  The Fourth Amendment guarantees individuals the right to be secure from unreasonable searches of \xe2\x80\x9c<i>their</i> persons, houses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>each</i> person has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in <i>his own</i> person, house, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Carter</i>,525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, 92 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring).  By obtaining the cell-site records of MetroPCS and Sprint, the Government did not search Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s property.  He did not create the records, he does not maintain them, he cannot control them, and he cannot destroy them.  Neither the terms of his contracts nor any provision of law makes the records his.  The records belong to MetroPCS and Sprint.</p><p>The Court concludes that, although the records are not Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s, the Government must get a warrant because Carpenter had a reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in the location information that they reveal.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  I agree with Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, Justice Gorsuch, and every Court of Appeals to consider the question that this is not the best reading of our  precedents.</p><p>The more fundamental problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, is its use of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d test, which was first articulated by Justice Harlan in <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347, 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (1967) (concurring opinion).  The <i>Katz</i> test has no basis in the text or history of the Fourth Amendment.  And, it invites courts to make judgments about policy, not law.  Until we confront the problems with this test, <i>Katz</i> will continue to distort Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  I respectfully dissent.</p><p>I</p><p><i>Katz</i> was the culmination of a series of decisions applying the Fourth Amendment to electronic eavesdropping.  The first such decision was <i>Olmstead</i> v. <i>United States</i>,277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438 (1928), where federal officers had intercepted the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conversations by tapping telephone lines near their homes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 456\xe2\x80\x93457.  In an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, the Court concluded that this wiretap did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  No \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d occurred, according to the Court, because the officers did not physically enter the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 homes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 464\xe2\x80\x93466.  And neither the telephone lines nor the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 intangible conversations qualified as \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, [or] effects\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  In the ensuing decades, this Court adhered to   </p><p><i>Olmstead</i> and rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to various methods of electronic surveillance.  See <i>On Lee</i> v. <i>United States</i>,343 U.\xc2\xa0S. 747, 749\xe2\x80\x93753 (1952) (use of microphone to overhear conversations with confidential informant); <i>Goldman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,316 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, 131\xe2\x80\x93132, 135\xe2\x80\x93136 (1942) (use of detectaphone to hear conversations in office next door).</p><p>In the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, however, the Court began to retreat from <i>Olmstead</i>.  In <i>Silverman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505 (1961), for example, federal officers had eavesdropped on the defendants by driving a \xe2\x80\x9cspike mike\xe2\x80\x9d several inches into the house they were occupying.  <i>Id.,</i> at 506\xe2\x80\x93507.  This was a \xe2\x80\x9csearch,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, because the \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized physical penetration into the premises\xe2\x80\x9d was an \xe2\x80\x9cactual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 509, 512.  The Court did not mention <i>Olmstead</i>\xe2\x80\x99s other holding that intangible conversations are not \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, [or] effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  That omission was significant.  The Court confirmed two years later that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t follows from [<i>Silverman</i>] that the Fourth Amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as against the more traditional seizure of \xe2\x80\x98papers and effects.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wong Sun</i> v. <i>United States</i>,371 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, 485 (1963); accord, <i>Berger</i> v. <i>New York</i>,388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41, 51 (1967).</p><p>In <i>Katz</i>, the Court rejected <i>Olmstead</i>\xe2\x80\x99s remaining holding\xe2\x80\x94that eavesdropping is not a search absent a physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area.  The federal officers in <i>Katz </i>had intercepted the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conversations by attaching an electronic device to the outside of a public telephone booth.  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 348.  The Court concluded that this was a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d because the officers \xe2\x80\x9cviolated the privacy upon which [the defendant] justifiably relied while using the telephone booth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 353.  Although the device did not physically penetrate the booth, the Court overruled <i>Olmstead</i> and held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe reach of [the Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353.  The Court did not explain what should replace <i>Olmstead</i>\xe2\x80\x99s physical-intrusion requirement.  It simply asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat [a person] seeks to preserve as private .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be constitutionally protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 351.</p><p>Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in <i>Katz </i>attempted to articulate the standard that was missing from the majority opinion.  While Justice Harlan agreed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d he stressed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is what protection it affords to those people,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe answer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. requires reference to a \xe2\x80\x98place.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 361.  Justice Harlan identified a \xe2\x80\x9ctwofold requirement\xe2\x80\x9d to determine when the protections of the Fourth Amendment apply: \xe2\x80\x9cfirst that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Justice Harlan did not cite anything for this \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d test, and the parties did not discuss it in their briefs.  The test appears to have been presented for the first time at oral argument by one of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers.  See Winn, <i>Katz</i> and the Origins of the \xe2\x80\x9cReason- able Expectation of Privacy\xe2\x80\x9d Test, 40 McGeorge L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (2009).  The lawyer, a recent law-school graduate, apparently had an \xe2\x80\x9c[e]piphany\xe2\x80\x9d while preparing for oral argument.  Schneider, <i>Katz v. United States</i>: The Untold Story, 40 McGeorge L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 13, 18 (2009).  He conjectured that, like the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d test from his Torts class, the Fourth Amendment should turn on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a reasonable person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could have expected his communication to be private.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 19.  The lawyer presented his new theory to the Court at oral argument.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Katz </i>v. <i>United States</i>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1967, No.\xc2\xa035, p.\xc2\xa05 (proposing a test of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not, objectively speaking, the communication was intended to be private\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe propose a test using a way that\xe2\x80\x99s not too dissimilar from the tort \xe2\x80\x98reasonable man\xe2\x80\x99 test\xe2\x80\x9d).  After some questioning from the Justices, the lawyer conceded that his test should also require individuals to subjectively expect privacy.  See <i>id.,</i> at 12.  With that modification, Justice Harlan seemed to accept the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s test almost verbatim in his concurrence.</p><p>Although the majority opinion in <i>Katz</i> had little practical significance after Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence profoundly changed our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  It took only one year for the full Court to adopt his two-pronged test.  See <i>Terry</i> v. <i>Ohio</i>,392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 10 (1968).  And by 1979, the Court was describing Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s test as the \xe2\x80\x9clodestar\xe2\x80\x9d for determining whether a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d had occurred.  <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, 739 (1979).  Over time, the Court minimized the subjective prong of Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s test.  See Kerr, <i>Katz</i> Has Only One Step: The Irrelevance of Subjective Expectations, 82 U.\xc2\xa0Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 113 (2015).  That left the objective prong\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d test that the Court still applies today.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 406 (2012).</p><p>II</p><p>Under the <i>Katz</i> test, a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d occurs whenever \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment officers violate a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98reasonable expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 406.  The most glaring problem with this test is that it has \xe2\x80\x9cno plausible foundation in the text of the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 97 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The Fourth Amendment, as relevant here, protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches.\xe2\x80\x9d  By defining \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of a reasonable expectation of pri- vacy,\xe2\x80\x9d the <i>Katz</i> test misconstrues virtually every one of these words.</p><p>A</p><p>The <i>Katz </i>test<i> </i>distorts the original meaning of \xe2\x80\x9csearc[h]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the word in the Fourth Amendment that it purports to define, see <i>ante</i>, at 5; <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Under the <i>Katz </i>test, the government conducts a search anytime it violates someone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not a normal definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9csearch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>At the founding, \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d did not mean a violation of someone\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectation of privacy.  The word was probably not a term of art, as it does not appear in legal dictionaries from the era.  And its ordinary meaning was the same as it is today: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]o look over or through for the purpose of finding something; to explore; to examine by inspection; as, to <i>search</i> the house for a book; to <i>search</i> the wood for a thief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kyllo</i> v. <i>United States</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, 32, n. 1 (2001) (quoting N.

Instead, the Fourth Amendment references \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure.\xe2\x80\x9d  It then qualifies that right by limiting it to \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d and three specific types of property: \xe2\x80\x9chouses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  By connecting the right to be secure to these four specific objects, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close connection to property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 405.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rivacy,\xe2\x80\x9d by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not part of the political vocabulary of the [founding].

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 37, 42 (2018).</p><p>Those who ratified the Fourth Amendment were quite familiar with the notion of security in property.  Security in property was a prominent concept in English law.  See, <i>e.g., </i>3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng-  </p><p>land 288 (1768) (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]very man\xe2\x80\x99s house is looked upon by the law to be his castle\xe2\x80\x9d); 3 E.

The political philosophy of John Locke, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cpermeated the 18th-century political scene in America.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Obergefell</i> v. <i>Hodges</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8).  For Locke, every individual had a property right \xe2\x80\x9cin his own person\xe2\x80\x9d and in anything he \xe2\x80\x9cremoved from the common state [of] Nature\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmixed his labour with.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second Treatise of Civil Government \xc2\xa727 (1690).  Because property is \xe2\x80\x9cvery unsecure\xe2\x80\x9d in the state of nature, \xc2\xa7123, individuals form governments to obtain \xe2\x80\x9ca secure enjoyment of their properties.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa795.  Once a government is formed, however, it cannot be given \xe2\x80\x9ca power to destroy that which every one designs to secure\xe2\x80\x9d; it cannot legitimately \xe2\x80\x9cendeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d or exercise \xe2\x80\x9can absolute power over [their] lives, liberties, and estates.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7222.</p><p>The concept of security in property recognized by Locke and the English legal tradition appeared throughout the materials that inspired the Fourth Amendment.  In <i>Entick</i> v. <i>Carrington</i>, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029 (C.\xc2\xa0P. 1765)\xe2\x80\x94a heralded decision that the founding generation considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe true and ultimate expression of constitutional law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Boyd</i> v. <i>United States</i>,116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616, 626 (1886)\xe2\x80\x94Lord Camden explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property.\xe2\x80\x9d  19 How. St. Tr., at 1066.  The American colonists echoed this reasoning in their \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread hostility\xe2\x80\x9d to the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s writs of assistance[<a href="#F6">6</a>]\xe2\x80\x94a practice that inspired the Revolution and became \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he driving force behind the adoption of the [Fourth] Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i>,494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259, 266 (1990).

John Otis, who argued the famous Writs of Assistance case, contended that the writs violated \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the fundamental Principl[e] of Law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] Man who is quiet, is as secure in his House, as a Prince in his Castle.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 339 (quoting John Adam\xe2\x80\x99s notes).

Adams ed. 1851).</p><p>Of course, the founding generation understood that, by securing their property, the Fourth Amendment would often protect their privacy as well.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Boyd</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 630 (explaining that searches of houses invade \xe2\x80\x9cthe privacies of life\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Wilkes</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, 19 How.

But the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s attendant protection of privacy does not justify <i>Katz</i>\xe2\x80\x99s elevation of privacy as the <i>sine qua non</i> of the Amendment.  See T.\xc2\xa0Clancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpretation \xc2\xa73.4.4, p.\xc2\xa078 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[The <i>Katz</i> test] confuse[s] the reasons for exercising the protected right with the right itself.  A purpose of exercising one\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights might be the desire for privacy, but the individual\xe2\x80\x99s motivation is not the right protected\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>United States </i>v. <i>Gonzalez- Lopez</i>,548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140, 145 (2006) (rejecting \xe2\x80\x9ca line of  reasoning that \xe2\x80\x98abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the majority opinion in <i>Katz </i>recognized, the Fourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be translated into a general constitutional \xe2\x80\x98right to privacy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as its protections \xe2\x80\x9coften have nothing to do with privacy at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 350.  Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s focus on privacy in his concurrence\xe2\x80\x94an opinion that was issued between <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i>,381 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479 (1965), and <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113 (1973)\xe2\x80\x94reflects privacy\xe2\x80\x99s status as the organizing constitutional idea of the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.  The organizing constitutional idea of the founding era, by contrast, was property.</p><p>C</p><p>In shifting the focus of the Fourth Amendment from property to privacy, the <i>Katz</i> test also reads the words \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d out of the text.  At its broadest formulation, the <i>Katz</i> test would find a search \xe2\x80\x9c<i>wherever</i> an individual may harbor a reasonable \xe2\x80\x98expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Terry</i>, 392 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 9 (emphasis added).  The Court today, for example, does not ask whether cell-site location records are \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, [or] effects\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  Yet \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9canywhere\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canything.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Katz</i>\xe2\x80\x99s catchphrase that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,\xe2\x80\x9d is not a serious attempt to reconcile the constitutional text.  See <i>Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 98, n.\xc2\xa03 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The Fourth Amendment obviously protects people; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is what protection it affords to those people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Katz</i>, 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).  The Founders decided to protect the people from unreasonable searches and seizures of four specific things\xe2\x80\x94persons, houses, papers, and effects.  They identified those four categories as \xe2\x80\x9cthe objects of privacy protection to which the <i>Constitution</i> would extend, leaving further expansion to the good judgment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the people through their representatives in the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 97\xe2\x80\x9398 (opinion of Scalia, J.).</p><p>This limiting language was important to the founders.  Madison\xe2\x80\x99s first draft of the Fourth Amendment used a different phrase: \xe2\x80\x9ctheir persons, their houses, their papers, and their <i>other property</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong. 452 (1789)   </p><p>(emphasis added).  In one of the few changes made to Madison\xe2\x80\x99s draft, the House Committee of Eleven changed \xe2\x80\x9cother property\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ceffects.\xe2\x80\x9d  See House Committee of Eleven Report (July 28, 1789), in N. Cogan, The Complete Bill of Rights 334 (2d ed. 2015).  This change might have narrowed the Fourth Amendment by clarifying that it does not protect real property (other than houses).  See <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>United States</i>,466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170, 177, and n.\xc2\xa07 (1984); Davies, Recovering the Original Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 547, 709\xe2\x80\x93714 (1999) (Davies).  Or the change might have broadened the Fourth Amendment by clarifying that it protects commercial goods, not just personal possessions.  See Donahue 1301.  Or it might have done both.  Whatever its ultimate effect, the change reveals that the Founders understood the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d to be an important measure of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s overall scope.  See Davies 710.  The <i>Katz</i> test, however, displaces and renders that phrase entirely \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 405.</p><p>D</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d are not the only words that the <i>Katz </i>test reads out of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment specifies that the people have a right to be secure from unreasonable searches of \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\xe2\x80\x9d persons, houses, papers, and effects.  Although phrased in the plural, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he obvious meaning of [\xe2\x80\x98their\xe2\x80\x99] is that <i>each</i> person has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures in <i>his own</i> person, house, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 92 (opinion of Sca- lia, J.); see also <i>District of Columbia</i> v. <i>Heller</i>,554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570, 579 (2008) (explaining that the Constitution uses the plural phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe people\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crefer to individual rights, not \xe2\x80\x98collective\xe2\x80\x99 rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  Stated differently, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\xe2\x80\x9d means, at the very least, that individuals do not have Fourth Amendment rights in <i>someone else\xe2\x80\x99s</i> property.  See <i>Carter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 92\xe2\x80\x9394 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Yet, under the <i>Katz</i> test, individuals can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in another person\xe2\x80\x99s property.  See, <i>e.g., Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89 (majority opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] person may have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the house of someone else\xe2\x80\x9d).  Until today, our precedents have not acknowledged that individuals can claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s business records.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  But the Court erases that line in this case, at least for cell-site location records.  In doing so, it confirms that the <i>Katz </i>test does not necessarily require an individual to prove that the government searched <i>his </i>person, house, paper, or effect.</p><p>Carpenter attempts to argue that the cell-site records are, in fact, his<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cpapers,\xe2\x80\x9d see Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9335; Reply Brief 14\xe2\x80\x9315, but his arguments are unpersuasive, see <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <i>post, </i>at 20\xe2\x80\x9323 (Alito, J., dissenting).  Carpenter stipulated below that the cell-site records are the business records of Sprint and MetroPCS.  See App. 51.  He cites no property law in his briefs to this Court, and he does not explain how he has a property right in the companies\xe2\x80\x99 records under the law of any jurisdiction at any point in American history.  If someone stole these records from Sprint or MetroPCS, Carpenter does not argue that he could recover in a traditional tort action.  Nor do his contracts with Sprint and MetroPCS make the records his, even though such provisions could exist in the marketplace.  Cf., <i>e.g., </i>Google Terms of Service, https://policies.google.com/terms (\xe2\x80\x9cSome of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content.  You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content.  In short, what belongs to you stays yours\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Instead of property, tort, or contract law, Carpenter relies on the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 to demonstrate that the cell site records are his papers.  The Telecommunications Act generally bars cell-phone companies from disclosing customers\xe2\x80\x99 cell site location information to the public.  See47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222(c).  This is sufficient to make the records his, Carpenter argues, because the Fourth Amendment merely requires him to identify a source of \xe2\x80\x9cpositive law\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cprotects against access by the public without consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9333 (citing Baude &amp; Stern, The Positive Law Model of the Fourth Amendment, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1821, 1825\xe2\x80\x931826 (2016); emphasis deleted).</p><p>Carpenter is mistaken.  To come within the text of the Fourth Amendment, Carpenter must prove that the cell-site records are <i>his</i>; positive law is potentially relevant only insofar as it answers that question.  The text of the Fourth Amendment cannot plausibly be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of positive law\xe2\x80\x9d any more than it can plausibly be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Thus, the Telecommunications Act is insufficient because it does not give Carpenter a property right in the cell-site records.  Section 222, titled \xe2\x80\x9cPrivacy of customer information,\xe2\x80\x9d protects customers\xe2\x80\x99 privacy by preventing cell-phone companies from disclosing sensitive information about them.  The statute creates a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to protect the confidentiality\xe2\x80\x9d of information relating to customers, \xc2\xa7222(a), and creates \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rivacy requirements\xe2\x80\x9d that limit the disclosure of that information, \xc2\xa7222(c)(1).  Nothing in the text pre-empts state property law or gives customers a property<i> </i>interest in the companies\xe2\x80\x99 business records (assuming Congress even has that authority).[<a href="#F9">9</a>]  Although \xc2\xa7222 \xe2\x80\x9cprotects the interests of individuals against wrongful uses or disclosures of personal data, the rationale for these legal protections has not historically been grounded on a perception that people have property rights in personal data as such.\xe2\x80\x9d  Samuelson, Privacy as Intellectual Property? 52 Stan. L. Rev. 1125, 1130\xe2\x80\x931131 (2000) (footnote omitted).  Any property rights remain with the  companies.</p><p>E</p><p>The <i>Katz</i> test comes closer to the text of the Fourth Amendment when it asks whether an expectation of pri- vacy is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d but it ultimately distorts that term as well.  The Fourth Amendment forbids \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches.\xe2\x80\x9d  In other words, reasonableness determines the legality of a search, not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a search .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. within the meaning of the Constitution has <i>occurred</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 97 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>Moreover, the <i>Katz</i> test invokes the concept of reason- ableness in a way that would be foreign to the ratifiers of the Fourth Amendment.  Originally, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunreason- able\xe2\x80\x9d in the Fourth Amendment likely meant \xe2\x80\x9cagainst reason\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as in \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the reason of the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Donahue 1270\xe2\x80\x931275; Davies 686\xe2\x80\x93693; <i>California</i> v. <i>Acevedo</i>,500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565, 583 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  At the founding, searches and seizures were   </p><p>regulated by a robust body of common-law rules.  See generally W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602\xe2\x80\x931791 (2009); <i>e.g., Wilson</i> v. <i>Arkansas</i>,514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 927, 931\xe2\x80\x93936 (1995) (discussing the common-law knock-and-announce rule).  The search-and-seizure practices that the Founders feared most\xe2\x80\x94such as general warrants\xe2\x80\x94were already illegal under the common law, and jurists such as Lord Coke described violations of the common law as \xe2\x80\x9cagainst reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Donahue 1270\xe2\x80\x931271, and n.\xc2\xa0513.  Locke, Blackstone, Adams, and other influential figures shortened the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cagainst reason\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at 1270\xe2\x80\x931275.  Thus, by prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d searches and seizures in the Fourth Amendment, the Founders ensured that the newly created Congress could not use legislation to abolish the established common-law rules of search and seizure.  See T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *303 (2d ed. 1871); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa71895, p.\xc2\xa0748 (1833).</p><p>Although the Court today maintains that its decision is based on \xe2\x80\x9cFounding-era understandings,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 6, the Founders would be puzzled by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion as well as its reasoning.  The Court holds that the Government unreasonably searched Carpenter by subpoenaing the cell-site records of Sprint and MetroPCS without a warrant.  But the Founders would not recognize the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 21.  The common law required warrants for some types of searches and seizures, but not for many others.  The relevant rule depended on context.  See <i>Acevedo</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 583\xe2\x80\x93584 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 763\xe2\x80\x93770 (1994); Davies 738\xe2\x80\x93739.  In cases like this one, a subpoena for third-party documents was not a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d to begin with, and the common law did not limit the government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to subpoena third parties.  See <i>post,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x9312 (Alito, J., dissenting).  Suffice it to say, the Founders would be confused by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s transformation of their common-law protection of property into a \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant requirement\xe2\x80\x9d and a vague inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectations of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>III</p><p>That the <i>Katz</i> test departs so far from the text of the Fourth Amendment is reason enough to reject it.  But the <i>Katz </i>test also has proved unworkable in practice.  Jurists and commentators tasked with deciphering our jurisprudence have described the <i>Katz </i>regime as \xe2\x80\x9can unpredictable jumble,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca mass of contradictions and obscurities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9call over the map,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9criddled with inconsistency and incoherence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca series of inconsistent and bizarre results that [the Court] has left entirely undefended,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunstable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cchameleon-like,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98notoriously unhelpful,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca conclusion rather than a starting point for analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdistressingly unmanageable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca dismal failure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cflawed to the core,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunadorned fiat,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinspired by the kind of logic that produced Rube Goldberg\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre contraptions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10">10</a>]  Even Justice Harlan, four years after penning his concurrence in <i>Katz</i>, confessed that the test encouraged \xe2\x80\x9cthe substitution of words for analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>White</i>,401 U.\xc2\xa0S. 745, 786 (1971) (dissenting opinion).</p><p>After 50 years, it is still unclear what question the <i>Katz </i>test is even asking.  This Court has steadfastly declined to elaborate the relevant considerations or identify any meaningful constraints.  See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o single rubric definitively resolves which expectations of privacy are entitled to protection\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</i> v. <i>Ortega</i>,480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709, 715 (1987) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no talisman that determines in all cases those privacy expectations that society is prepared to accept as reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Oliver</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 177 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo single factor determines whether an individual legitimately may claim under the Fourth Amendment that a place should be free of government intrusion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s original formulation of the <i>Katz</i> test appears to ask a descriptive question: Whether a given expectation of privacy is \xe2\x80\x9cone that society is prepared to recognize as \xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 361.  As written, the <i>Katz</i> test turns on society\xe2\x80\x99s actual, current views about the reasonableness of various expectations of privacy.</p><p>But this descriptive understanding presents several problems.  For starters, it is easily circumvented.  If, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry,\xe2\x80\x9d individuals could not realistically expect privacy in their homes.  <i>Smith</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 740, n.\xc2\xa05; see also Chemerinsky, Rediscovering Brandeis\xe2\x80\x99s   </p><p>Right to Privacy, 45 Brandeis L.\xc2\xa0J. 643, 650 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Under <i>Katz,</i> t]he government seemingly can deny privacy just by letting people know in advance not to expect any\xe2\x80\x9d).  A purely descriptive understanding of the <i>Katz</i> test also risks \xe2\x80\x9ccircular[ity].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kyllo</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 34.  While this Court is supposed to base its decisions on society\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of privacy, society\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of privacy are, in turn, shaped by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  See Posner, The Uncertain Protection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979 S.\xc2\xa0Ct. Rev. 173, 188 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether [a person] will or will not have [a reasonable] expectation [of privacy] will depend on what the legal rule is\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>To address this circularity problem, the Court has insisted that expectations of privacy must come from outside its Fourth Amendment precedents, \xe2\x80\x9ceither by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rakas</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 144, n.\xc2\xa012 (1978).  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s supposed reliance on \xe2\x80\x9creal or personal property law\xe2\x80\x9d rings hollow.  The whole point of <i>Katz </i>was to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discredi[t]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the relationship between the Fourth Amendment and property law, 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353, and this Court has repeatedly downplayed the importance of property law under the <i>Katz </i>test, see, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Salvucci</i>,448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, 91 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]roperty rights are neither the beginning nor the end of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry [under <i>Katz</i>]\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Rawlings</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98, 105 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c[This Court has] emphatically rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x98arcane\xe2\x80\x99 concepts of property law ought to control the ability to claim the protections of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Today, for example, the Court makes no mention of property law, except to reject its relevance.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5, and n.\xc2\xa01.</p><p>As for \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandings that are recognized or permitted in society,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has never answered even the most basic questions about what this means.  See Kerr, Four Models of Fourth Amendment Protection, 60 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 503, 504\xe2\x80\x93505 (2007).  For example, our precedents do not explain who is included in \xe2\x80\x9csociety,\xe2\x80\x9d how we know what they \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[e] or permi[t],\xe2\x80\x9d and how much of society must  agree before something constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Here, for example, society might prefer a balanced regime that prohibits the Government from obtaining cell-site location information unless it can persuade a neutral magistrate that the information bears on an ongoing criminal investigation.  That is precisely the regime Congress created under the Stored Communications Act and Telecommunications Act.  See47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222(c)(1); 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72703(c)(1)(B), (d).  With no sense of irony, the Court invalidates this regime today\xe2\x80\x94the one that society actually created \xe2\x80\x9cin the form of its elected representatives in Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  819 F.\xc2\xa03d 880, 890 (2016).</p><p>Truth be told, this Court does not treat the <i>Katz</i> test as a descriptive inquiry.  Although the <i>Katz </i>test is phrased in descriptive terms about society\xe2\x80\x99s views, this Court treats it like a normative question\xe2\x80\x94whether a particular practice <i>should</i> be considered a search under the Fourth Amendment.  Justice Harlan thought this was the best way to understand his test.  See <i>White</i>, 401 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 786 (dissenting opinion) (explaining that courts must assess the \xe2\x80\x9cdesirability\xe2\x80\x9d of privacy expectations and ask whether courts \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d recognize them by \xe2\x80\x9cbalanc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cimpact on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s sense of security .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. against the utility of the conduct as a technique of law enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d).  And a normative understanding is the only way to make sense of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, which bear the hallmarks of subjective policymaking instead of neutral legal decisionmaking.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he only thing the past three decades have established about the <i>Katz</i> test\xe2\x80\x9d is that society\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of privacy \xe2\x80\x9cbear an uncanny resemblance to those expectations of privacy that this Court considers reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d    </p><p><i>Carter</i>, 525 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 97 (opinion of Scalia, J.).

Whether the rights they ratified are too broad or too narrow by modern lights, this Court has no authority to unilaterally alter the document they approved.</p><p>Because the <i>Katz</i> test is a failed experiment, this Court is dutybound to reconsider it.

And it places undue restrictions on the lawful and necessary enforcement powers exercised not only by the Federal Government, but also by law enforcement in every State and locality throughout the Nation.  Adherence to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding precedents and analytic framework would have been the proper and prudent way to resolve this case.</p><p>The Court has twice held that individuals have no Fourth Amendment interests in business records which are possessed, owned, and controlled by a third party.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435 (1976); <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735 (1979).  This is true even when the records contain personal and sensitive information.  So when the Government uses a subpoena to obtain, for example, bank records, telephone records, and credit card statements from the businesses that create and keep these records, the Government does not engage in a search of the business\xe2\x80\x99s customers within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>In this case petitioner challenges the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to use compulsory process to obtain a now-common kind of business record: cell-site records held by cell phone service providers.  The Government acquired the records through an investigative process enacted by Congress. Upon approval by a neutral magistrate, and based on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s duty to show reasonable necessity, it authorizes the disclosure of records and information that are under the control and ownership of the cell phone service provider, not its customer.  Petitioner acknowledges that the Government may obtain a wide variety of business records using compulsory process, and he does not ask the Court to revisit its precedents.  Yet he argues that, under those same precedents, the Government searched his records when it used court-approved compulsory process to obtain the cell-site information at issue here.</p><p>Cell-site records, however, are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process.  Customers like petitioner do not own, possess, control, or use the records, and for that reason have no reasonable expectation that they cannot be disclosed pursuant to lawful compulsory process.</p><p>The Court today disagrees.  It holds for the first time that by using compulsory process to obtain records of a business entity, the Government has not just engaged in an impermissible action, but has conducted a search of the business\xe2\x80\x99s customer.  The Court further concludes that the search in this case was unreasonable and the Government needed to get a warrant to obtain more than six days of cell-site records.</p><p>In concluding that the Government engaged in a search, the Court unhinges Fourth Amendment doctrine from the property-based concepts that have long grounded the analytic framework that pertains in these cases.  In doing so it draws an unprincipled and unworkable line between cell-site records on the one hand and financial and telephonic records on the other.  According to today\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion, the Government can acquire a record of every credit card purchase and phone call a person makes over months or years without upsetting a legitimate expectation of privacy.  But, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Government crosses a constitutional line when it obtains a court\xe2\x80\x99s approval to issue a subpoena for more than six days of cell-site records in order to determine whether a person was within several hundred city blocks of a crime scene.  That distinction is illogical and will frustrate principled application of the Fourth Amendment in many routine yet vital law enforcement operations.</p><p>It is true that the Cyber Age has vast potential both to expand and restrict individual freedoms in dimensions not contemplated in earlier times.  See <i>Packingham</i> v. <i>North Carolina</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2017) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x936).  For the reasons that follow, however, there is simply no basis here for concluding that the Government interfered with information that the cell phone customer, either from a legal or commonsense standpoint, should have thought the law would deem owned or controlled by him.</p><p>I</p><p>Before evaluating the question presented it is helpful to understand the nature of cell-site records, how they are commonly used by cell phone service providers, and their proper use by law enforcement.</p><p>When a cell phone user makes a call, sends a text message or e-mail, or gains access to the Internet, the cell phone establishes a radio connection to an antenna at a nearby cell site.  The typical cell site covers a more-or-less circular geographic area around the site.  It has three (or sometimes six) separate antennas pointing in different directions.  Each provides cell service for a different 120-degree (or 60-degree) sector of the cell site\xe2\x80\x99s circular coverage area.  So a cell phone activated on the north side of a cell site will connect to a different antenna than a cell phone on the south side.</p><p>Cell phone service providers create records each time a cell phone connects to an antenna at a cell site.  For a phone call, for example, the provider records the date, time, and duration of the call; the phone numbers making and receiving the call; and, most relevant here, the cell site used to make the call, as well as the specific antenna that made the connection.  The cell-site and antenna data points, together with the date and time of connection, are known as cell-site location information, or cell-site records.  By linking an individual\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone to a particular 120- or 60-degree sector of a cell site\xe2\x80\x99s coverage area at a particular time, cell-site records reveal the general location of the cell phone user.</p><p>The location information revealed by cell-site records is imprecise, because an individual cell-site sector usually covers a large geographic area.  The FBI agent who offered expert testimony about the cell-site records at issue here testified that a cell site in a city reaches between a half mile and two miles in all directions.  That means a 60-degree sector covers between approximately one-eighth and two square miles (and a 120-degree sector twice that area).  To put that in perspective, in urban areas cell-site records often would reveal the location of a cell phone user within an area covering between around a dozen and several hundred city blocks.  In rural areas cell-site records can be up to 40 times more imprecise.  By contrast, a Global Positioning System (GPS) can reveal an individ- ual\xe2\x80\x99s location within around 15 feet.</p><p>Major cell phone service providers keep cell-site records for long periods of time.  There is no law requiring them to do so.  Instead, providers contract with their customers to collect and keep these records because they are valuable to the providers.  Among other things, providers aggregate the records and sell them to third parties along with other information gleaned from cell phone usage.  This data can be used, for example, to help a department store determine which of various prospective store locations is likely to get more foot traffic from middle-aged women who live in affluent zip codes.  The market for cell phone data is now estimated to be in the billions of dollars.  See Brief for Technology Experts as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 23.</p><p>Cell-site records also can serve an important investigative function, as the facts of this case demonstrate.  Petitioner, Timothy Carpenter, along with a rotating group of accomplices, robbed at least six RadioShack and T-Mobile stores at gunpoint over a 2-year period.  Five of those robberies occurred in the Detroit area, each crime at least four miles from the last.  The sixth took place in Warren, Ohio, over 200 miles from Detroit.</p><p>The Government, of course, did not know all of these details in 2011 when it began investigating Carpenter.  In April of that year police arrested four of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s co-conspirators.  One of them confessed to committing nine robberies in Michigan and Ohio between December 2010 and March 2011.  He identified 15 accomplices who had participated in at least one of those robberies; named Carpenter as one of the accomplices; and provided Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone number to the authorities.  The suspect also warned that the other members of the conspiracy planned to commit more armed robberies in the immediate future.</p><p>The Government at this point faced a daunting task.  Even if it could identify and apprehend the suspects, still it had to link each suspect in this changing criminal gang to specific robberies in order to bring charges and convict.  And, of course, it was urgent that the Government take all necessary steps to stop the ongoing and dangerous crime spree.</p><p>Cell-site records were uniquely suited to this task.  The geographic dispersion of the robberies meant that, if Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone were within even a dozen to several hundred city blocks of one or more of the stores when the different robberies occurred, there would be powerful circumstantial evidence of his participation; and this would be especially so if his cell phone usually was not located in the sectors near the stores except during the robbery times.</p><p>To obtain these records, the Government applied to federal magistrate judges for disclosure orders pursuant to \xc2\xa72703(d) of the Stored Communications Act.  That Act authorizes a magistrate judge to issue an order requiring disclosure of cell-site records if the Government demonstrates \xe2\x80\x9cspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe\xe2\x80\x9d the records \xe2\x80\x9care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72703(d), 2711(3).  The full statutory provision is set out in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p><p>From Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s primary service provider, MetroPCS, the Government obtained records from between December 2010 and April 2011, based on its understanding that nine robberies had occurred in that timeframe.  The Government also requested seven days of cell-site records from Sprint, spanning the time around the robbery in Warren, Ohio.  It obtained two days of records.</p><p>These records confirmed that Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone was in the general vicinity of four of the nine robberies, including the one in Ohio, at the times those robberies occurred.</p><p>II</p><p>The first Clause of the Fourth Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  The customary beginning point in any Fourth Amendment search case is whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s actions constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s person, house, papers, or effects, within the meaning of the constitutional provision.  If so, the next question is whether that search was reasonable.</p><p>Here the only question necessary to decide is whether the Government searched anything of Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s when it used compulsory process to obtain cell-site records from Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone service providers.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> dictate that the answer is no, as every Court of Appeals to have considered the question has recognized.  See<i> United States </i>v. <i>Thompson</i>, 866 F.\xc2\xa03d 1149 (CA10 2017); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Graham</i>, 824 F.\xc2\xa03d 421 (CA4 2016) (en banc); <i>Carpenter </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 819 F.\xc2\xa03d 880 (CA6 2016); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Davis</i>, 785 F.\xc2\xa03d 498 (CA11 2015) (en banc); <i>In\xc2\xa0re Application  of U.\xc2\xa0S. for Historical Cell Site Data</i>, 724 F.\xc2\xa03d 600  (CA5 2013).</p><p>A</p><p><i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> hold that individuals lack any protected Fourth Amendment interests in records that are possessed, owned, and controlled only by a third party.  In <i>Miller</i> federal law enforcement officers obtained four months of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s banking records.  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 437\xe2\x80\x93438.  And in <i>Smith</i> state police obtained records of the phone numbers dialed from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s home phone.  442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 737.  The Court held in both cases that the officers did not search anything belonging to the defendants within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The defendants could \xe2\x80\x9cassert neither ownership nor possession\xe2\x80\x9d of the records because the records were created, owned, and controlled by the companies.  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 440; see <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 741.  And the defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in information they \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily conveyed to the [companies] and exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 442; see <i>Smith</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 744.  Rather, the defendants \xe2\x80\x9cassumed the risk that the information would be divulged to police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 745.</p><p><i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> have been criticized as being based on too narrow a view of reasonable expectations of privacy.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Ashdown, The Fourth Amendment and the \xe2\x80\x9cLegitimate Expectation of Privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d 34 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1289, 1313\xe2\x80\x931316 (1981).  Those criticisms, however, are unwarranted.  The principle established in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> is correct for two reasons, the first relating to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attenuated interest in property owned by another, and the second relating to the safeguards inherent in the use of compulsory process.</p><p>First, <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> placed necessary limits on the ability of individuals to assert Fourth Amendment interests in property to which they lack a \xe2\x80\x9crequisite connection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Carter</i>,525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, 99 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Fourth Amendment rights, after all, are personal.  The Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in <i>their</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. persons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not the persons, houses, papers, and effects of others.  (Emphasis added.)</p><p>The concept of reasonable expectations of privacy, first announced in <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967), sought to look beyond the \xe2\x80\x9carcane distinctions developed in property and tort law\xe2\x80\x9d in evaluating whether a person has a sufficient connection to the thing or place searched to assert Fourth Amendment interests in it.  <i>Rakas</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 143 (1978).  Yet \xe2\x80\x9cproperty concepts\xe2\x80\x9d are, nonetheless, fundamental \xe2\x80\x9cin determining the presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by that Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 143\xe2\x80\x93144, n.\xc2\xa012.  This is so for at least two reasons.  First, as a matter of settled expectations from the law of property, individuals often have greater expectations of privacy in things and places that belong to them, not to others.  And second, the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections must remain tethered to the text of that Amendment, which, again, protects only a person\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p><i>Katz</i> did not abandon reliance on property-based concepts.  The Court in <i>Katz</i> analogized the phone booth used in that case to a friend\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, a taxicab, and a hotel room.  389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352, 359.  So when the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cshu[t] the door behind him\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpa[id] the toll,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 352, he had a temporary interest in the space and a legitimate expectation that others would not intrude, much like the interest a hotel guest has in a hotel room, <i>Stoner</i> v. <i>California</i>,376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483 (1964), or an overnight guest has in a host\xe2\x80\x99s home, <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Olson</i>,495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 91 (1990).  The Government intruded on that space when it attached a listening device to the phone booth.  <i>Katz</i>, 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 348.  (And even so, the Court made it clear that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s search could have been reasonable had there been judicial approval on a case-specific basis, which, of course, did occur here.  <i>Id</i>., at 357\xe2\x80\x93359.)</p><p><i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> set forth an important and necessary limitation on the <i>Katz</i> framework.  They rest upon the commonsense principle that the absence of property law analogues can be dispositive of privacy expectations.  The defendants in those cases could expect that the third-party businesses could use the records the companies collected, stored, and classified as their own for any number of business and commercial purposes.  The businesses were not bailees or custodians of the records, with a duty to hold the records for the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 use.  The defendants could make no argument that the records were their own papers or effects.  See <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 440 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe documents subpoenaed here are not respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98private papers\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 741 (\xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner obviously cannot claim that his \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99 was invaded\xe2\x80\x9d).  The records were the business entities\xe2\x80\x99 records, plain and simple.  The defendants had no reason to believe the records were owned or controlled by them and so could not assert a reasonable expectation of privacy in the records.</p><p>The second principle supporting <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> is the longstanding rule that the Government may use compulsory process to compel persons to disclose documents and other evidence within their possession and control.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nixon</i>,418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683, 709 (1974) (it is an \xe2\x80\x9cancient proposition of law\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe public has a right to every man\xe2\x80\x99s evidence\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  A subpoena is different from a warrant in its force and intrusive power.  While a warrant allows the Government to enter and seize and make the examination itself, a subpoena simply requires the person to whom it is directed to make the disclosure.  A subpoena, moreover, provides the recipient the \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to present objections\xe2\x80\x9d before complying, which further mitigates the intrusion.  <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>Walling</i>,327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, 195 (1946).</p><p>For those reasons this Court has held that a subpoena for records, although a \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive\xe2\x80\x9d search subject to Fourth Amendment constraints, need not comply with the procedures applicable to warrants\xe2\x80\x94even when challenged by the person to whom the records belong.  <i>Id.,</i> at 202, 208.  Rather, a subpoena complies with the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness requirement so long as it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Donovan</i> v. <i>Lone Steer, Inc.</i>,464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408, 415 (1984).  Persons with no meaningful interests in the records sought by a subpoena, like the defendants in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>, have no rights to object to the records\xe2\x80\x99 disclosure\xe2\x80\x94much less to assert that the Government must obtain a warrant to compel disclosure of the records.  See <i>Miller</i>, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 444\xe2\x80\x93446; <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Jerry T. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, Inc.</i>,467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735, 742\xe2\x80\x93743 (1984).</p><p>Based on <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> and the principles underlying those cases, it is well established that subpoenas may be used to obtain a wide variety of records held by businesses, even when the records contain private information.  See 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa74.13 (5th ed. 2012).  Credit cards are a prime example.  State and federal law enforcement, for instance, often subpoena credit card statements to develop probable cause to prosecute crimes ranging from drug trafficking and distribution to healthcare fraud to tax evasion.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Phibbs</i>, 999 F.\xc2\xa02d 1053 (CA6 1993) (drug distribution); <i>McCune</i> v. <i>DOJ</i>, 592 Fed. Appx. 287 (CA5 2014) (healthcare fraud); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Green</i>, 305 F.\xc2\xa03d 422 (CA6 2002) (drug trafficking and tax evasion); see also 12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73402(4), 3407 (allowing the Government to subpoena financial records if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is reason to believe that the records sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d).  Subpoenas also may be used to obtain vehicle registration records, hotel records, employment records, and records of utility usage, to name just a few other examples.  See 1 LaFave, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa72.7(c).</p><p>And law enforcement officers are not alone in their reliance on subpoenas to obtain business records for legitimate investigations.  Subpoenas also are used for investigatory purposes by state and federal grand juries, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dionisio</i>,410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1973), state and federal administrative agencies, see <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, <i>supra</i>, and state and federal legislative bodies, see <i>McPhaul</i> v. <i>United States</i>,364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 372 (1960).</p><p>B</p><p>Carpenter does not question these traditional investigative practices.  And he does not ask the Court to reconsider <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  Carpenter argues only that, under <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>, the Government may not use compulsory process to acquire cell-site records from cell phone service providers.</p><p>There is no merit in this argument.  Cell-site records, like all the examples just discussed, are created, kept, classified, owned, and controlled by cell phone service providers, which aggregate and sell this information to third parties.  As in <i>Miller</i>, Carpenter can \xe2\x80\x9cassert neither ownership nor possession\xe2\x80\x9d of the records and has no control over them.  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 440.</p><p>Carpenter argues that he has Fourth Amendment interests in the cell-site records because they are in essence his personal papers by operation of47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7222.  That statute imposes certain restrictions on how providers may use \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer proprietary network information\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term that encompasses cell-site records.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7222(c), (h)(1)(A).  The statute in general prohibits providers from disclosing personally identifiable cell-site records to private third parties.  \xc2\xa7222(c)(1).  And it allows customers to request cell-site records from the provider.  \xc2\xa7222(c)(2).</p><p>Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s argument is unpersuasive, however, for  \xc2\xa7222 does not grant cell phone customers any meaningful interest in cell-site records.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality protections may be overridden by the interests of the providers or the Government.  The providers may disclose the records \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the[ir] rights or property\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate, render, bill, and collect for telecommunications services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7222(d)(1), (2).  They also may disclose the records \xe2\x80\x9cas required by law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, of course, is how they were disclosed in this case.  \xc2\xa7222(c)(1).  Nor does the statute provide customers any practical control over the records.  Customers do not create the records; they have no say in whether or for how long the records are stored; and they cannot require the records to be modified or destroyed.  Even their right to request access to the records is limited, for the statute \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not preclude a carrier from being reimbursed by the customers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the costs associated with making such disclosures.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93204, pt. 1, p. 90 (1995).  So in every legal and practical sense the \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork information\xe2\x80\x9d regulated by \xc2\xa7222 is, under that statute, \xe2\x80\x9cproprietary\xe2\x80\x9d to the service providers, not Carpenter.  The Court does not argue otherwise.</p><p>Because Carpenter lacks a requisite connection to the cell-site records, he also may not claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in them.  He could expect that a third party\xe2\x80\x94the cell phone service provider\xe2\x80\x94could use the information it collected, stored, and classified as its own for a variety of business and commercial purposes.</p><p>All this is not to say that <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> are without limits.  <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> may not apply when the Government obtains the modern-day equivalents of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cpapers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceffects,\xe2\x80\x9d even when those papers or effects are held by a third party.  See <i>Ex parte Jackson</i>,96 U.\xc2\xa0S. 727, 733 (1878) (letters held by mail carrier); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Warshak</i>, 631 F.\xc2\xa03d 266, 283\xe2\x80\x93288 (CA6 2010) (e-mails held by Internet service provider).  As already discussed, however, this case does not involve property or a bailment of that sort.  Here the Government\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of cell-site records falls within the heartland of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.</p><p>In fact, Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment objection is even weaker than those of the defendants in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  Here the Government did not use a mere sub- poena to obtain the cell-site records.  It acquired the records only after it proved to a Magistrate Judge reasonable grounds to believe that the records were relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.  See18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  So even if \xc2\xa7222 gave Carpenter some attenuated interest in the records, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s conduct here would be reasonable under the standards governing subpoenas.  See <i>Donovan</i>, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 415.</p><p>Under <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>, then, a search of the sort that requires a warrant simply did not occur when the Government used court-approved compulsory process, based on a finding of reasonable necessity, to compel a cell phone service provider, as owner, to disclose cell-site records.</p><p>III</p><p>The Court rejects a straightforward application of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  It concludes instead that applying those cases to cell-site records would work a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant extension\xe2\x80\x9d of the principles underlying them, <i>ante,</i> at 15, and holds that the acquisition of more than six days of cell-site records constitutes a search, <i>ante,</i> at 11, n.\xc2\xa03.</p><p>In my respectful view the majority opinion misreads this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, old and recent, and transforms <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> into an unprincipled and unworkable doctrine.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s newly conceived constitutional standard will cause confusion; will undermine traditional and important law enforcement practices; and will allow the cell phone to become a protected medium that dangerous persons will use to commit serious crimes.</p><p>A</p><p>The Court errs at the outset by attempting to sidestep <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  The Court frames this case as following instead from <i>United States</i> v. <i>Knotts</i>,460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276 (1983), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400 (2012).  Those cases, the Court suggests, establish that \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939, 12.</p><p><i>Knotts</i> held just the opposite: \xe2\x80\x9cA person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281.  True, the Court in <i>Knotts</i> also suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent constitutional principles may be applicable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdragnet-type law enforcement practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 284.  But by dragnet practices the Court was referring to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98twenty-four hour surveillance of any citizen of this country .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without judicial knowledge or supervision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 283.</p><p>Those \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent constitutional principles\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned in <i>Knotts</i>, whatever they may be, do not apply in this case.  Here the Stored Communications Act requires a neutral judicial officer to confirm in each case that the Government has \xe2\x80\x9creasonable grounds to believe\xe2\x80\x9d the cell-site records \xe2\x80\x9care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72703(d).  This judicial check mitigates the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a too permeating police surveillance.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 6 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Di Re</i>,332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581, 595 (1948)).  Here, even more so  than in <i>Knotts</i>, \xe2\x80\x9creality hardly suggests abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 284.</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <i>Jones</i> fares no better.  In <i>Jones</i> the Government installed a GPS tracking device on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s automobile.  The Court held the Government searched the automobile because it \xe2\x80\x9cphysically occupied private property [of the defendant] for the purpose of obtaining information.\xe2\x80\x9d  565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404.  So in <i>Jones</i> it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessary to inquire about the target\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of privacy in his vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Grady </i>v. <i>North Carolina</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 3).</p><p>Despite that clear delineation of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Jones</i>, the Court today declares that <i>Jones</i> applied the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98different constitutional principles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d alluded to in <i>Knotts</i> to establish that an individual has an expectation of pri- vacy in the sum of his whereabouts.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8, 12.  For that proposition the majority relies on the two concurring opinions in <i>Jones</i>, one of which stated that \xe2\x80\x9clonger term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430 (Alito, J., concurring).  But <i>Jones</i> involved direct governmental surveillance of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s automobile without judicial authorization\xe2\x80\x94specifically, GPS surveillance accurate within 50 to 100 feet.  <i>Id.</i>, at 402\xe2\x80\x93403.  Even assuming that the different constitutional principles mentioned in <i>Knotts</i> would apply in a case like <i>Jones</i>\xe2\x80\x94a proposition the Court was careful not to announce in <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 412\xe2\x80\x93413\xe2\x80\x94those principles are inapplicable here.  Cases like this one, where the Government uses court-approved compulsory process to obtain records owned and controlled by a third party, are governed by the two majority opinions in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.</p><p>B</p><p>The Court continues its analysis by misinterpreting <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>, and then it reaches the wrong outcome on these facts even under its flawed standard.</p><p>The Court appears, in my respectful view, to read <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> to establish a balancing test.  For each \xe2\x80\x9cqualitatively different category\xe2\x80\x9d of information, the Court suggests, the privacy interests at stake must be weighed against the fact that the information has been disclosed to a third party.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11, 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  When the privacy interests are weighty enough to \xe2\x80\x9covercome\xe2\x80\x9d the third-party disclosure, the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections apply.  See <i>ante</i>, at 17.</p><p>That is an untenable reading of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  As already discussed, the fact that information was relinquished to a third party was the entire basis for concluding that the defendants in those cases lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy.  <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> do not establish the kind of category-by-category balancing the Court today prescribes.</p><p>But suppose the Court were correct to say that <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> rest on so imprecise a foundation.  Still the Court errs, in my submission, when it concludes that cell-site records implicate greater privacy interests\xe2\x80\x94and thus deserve greater Fourth Amendment protection\xe2\x80\x94than financial records and telephone records.</p><p>Indeed, the opposite is true.  A person\xe2\x80\x99s movements are not particularly private.  As the Court recognized in <i>Knotts</i>, when the defendant there \xe2\x80\x9ctraveled over the public streets he voluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look the fact that he was traveling over particular roads in a particular direction, the fact of whatever stops he made, and the fact of his final destination.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  Today expectations of privacy in one\xe2\x80\x99s location are, if anything, even less reasonable than when the Court decided <i>Knotts</i> over 30 years ago.  Millions of Americans choose to share their location on a daily basis, whether by using a variety of location-based services on their phones, or by sharing their location with friends and the public at large via social media.</p><p>And cell-site records, as already discussed, disclose a person\xe2\x80\x99s location only in a general area.  The records at issue here, for example, revealed Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s location within an area covering between around a dozen and several hundred city blocks.  \xe2\x80\x9cAreas of this scale might encompass bridal stores and Bass Pro Shops, gay bars and straight ones, a Methodist church and the local mosque.\xe2\x80\x9d  819 F.\xc2\xa03d 880, 889 (CA6 2016).  These records could not reveal where Carpenter lives and works, much less his \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12 (quoting <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 415 (Sotomayor, J., concurring)).</p><p>By contrast, financial records and telephone records do \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98revea[l] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. personal affairs, opinions, habits and associations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 451 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see <i>Smith</i>, 442 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 751 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  What persons purchase and to whom they talk might disclose how much money they make; the political and religious organizations to which they donate; whether they have visited a psychiatrist, plastic surgeon, abortion clinic, or AIDS treatment center; whether they go to gay bars or straight ones; and who are their closest friends and family members.  The troves of intimate information the Government can and does obtain using financial records and telephone records dwarfs what can be gathered from cell-site records.</p><p>Still, the Court maintains, cell-site records are \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d because they are \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d in their reach; allow for retrospective collection; are \xe2\x80\x9ceasy, cheap, and efficient compared to traditional investigative tools\xe2\x80\x9d; and are not exposed to cell phone service providers in a meaningfully voluntary manner.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, 17, 22.  But many other kinds of business records can be so described.  Financial records are of vast scope.  Banks and credit card companies keep a comprehensive account of almost every transaction an individual makes on a daily basis.  \xe2\x80\x9cWith just the click of a button, the Government can access each [company\xe2\x80\x99s] deep repository of historical [financial] information at practically no expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  And the decision whether to transact with banks and credit card companies is no more or less voluntary than the decision whether to use a cell phone.  Today, just as when <i>Miller</i> was decided, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is impossible to participate in the economic life of contemporary society without maintaining a bank account.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 451 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  But this Court, nevertheless, has held that individ- uals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records.</p><p>Perhaps recognizing the difficulty of drawing the constitutional line between cell-site records and financial and telephonic records, the Court posits that the accuracy of cell-site records \xe2\x80\x9cis rapidly approaching GPS-level precision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  That is certainly plausible in the era of cyber technology, yet the privacy interests associated with location information, which is often disclosed to the public at large, still would not outweigh the privacy interests implicated by financial and telephonic records.</p><p>Perhaps more important, those future developments are no basis upon which to resolve this case.  In general, the Court \xe2\x80\x9crisks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ontario</i> v. <i>Quon</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 746, 759 (2010).  That judicial caution, prudent in most cases, is imperative in this one.</p><p>Technological changes involving cell phones have complex effects on crime and law enforcement.  Cell phones make crimes easier to coordinate and conceal, while also providing the Government with new investigative tools that may have the potential to upset traditional privacy expectations.  See Kerr, An Equilibrium-Adjustment Theory of the Fourth Amendment, 125 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev 476, 512\xe2\x80\x93517 (2011).  How those competing effects balance against each other, and how property norms and expectations of privacy form around new technology, often will be difficult to determine during periods of rapid technological change.  In those instances, and where the governing legal standard is one of reasonableness, it is wise to defer to legislative judgments like the one embodied in \xc2\xa72703(d) of the Stored Communications Act.  See <i>Jones</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430 (Alito, J., concurring).  In \xc2\xa72703(d) Congress weighed the privacy interests at stake and imposed a judicial check to prevent executive overreach.  The Court should be wary of upsetting that legislative balance and erecting constitutional barriers that foreclose further legislative instructions.  See <i>Quon</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 759.  The last thing the Court should do is incorporate an arbitrary and outside limit\xe2\x80\x94in this case six days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of cell-site records\xe2\x80\x94and use it as the foundation for a new constitutional framework.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision runs roughshod over the mechanism Congress put in place to govern the acquisition of cell-site records and closes off further legislative debate on these issues.</p><p>C</p><p>The Court says its decision is a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 17.  But its reinterpretation of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i> will have dramatic consequences for law enforcement, courts, and society as a whole.</p><p>Most immediately, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Government must get a warrant to obtain more than six days of cell-site records limits the effectiveness of an important investigative tool for solving serious crimes.  As this case demonstrates, cell-site records are uniquely suited to help the Government develop probable cause to apprehend some of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous criminals: serial killers, rapists, arsonists, robbers, and so forth.  See also, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Davis</i>, 785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 500\xe2\x80\x93501 (armed robbers); Brief for Alabama et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (serial killer).  These records often are indispensable at the initial stages of investigations when the Government lacks the evidence necessary to obtain a warrant.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pembrook</i>, 876 F. 3d 812, 816\xe2\x80\x93819 (CA6 2017).  And the long-term nature of many serious crimes, including serial crimes and terrorism offenses, can necessitate the use of significantly more than six days of cell-site records.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary 6-day cutoff has the perverse effect  of nullifying Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable framework for obtain- ing cell-site records in some of the most serious criminal investigations.</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision also will have ramifications that extend beyond cell-site records to other kinds of information held by third parties, yet the Court fails \xe2\x80\x9cto provide clear guidance to law enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d and courts on key issues raised by its reinterpretation of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.  <i>Riley</i> v. <i>California</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,  at 22).</p><p><i>First</i>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is premised on cell-site records being a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct category of information\xe2\x80\x9d from other business records.  <i>Ante</i>, at 15.  But the Court does not explain what makes something a distinct category of information.  Whether credit card records are distinct from bank records; whether payment records from digital wallet applications are distinct from either; whether the electronic bank records available today are distinct from the paper and microfilm records at issue in <i>Miller</i>; or whether cell-phone call records are distinct from the home-phone call records at issue in <i>Smith</i>, are just a few of the difficult questions that require answers under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel conception of <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>.</p><p><i>Second</i>, the majority opinion gives courts and law enforcement officers no indication how to determine whether any particular category of information falls on the financial-records side or the cell-site-records side of its newly conceived constitutional line.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s multifactor analysis\xe2\x80\x94considering intimacy, comprehensiveness, expense, retrospectivity, and voluntariness\xe2\x80\x94puts the law on a new and unstable foundation.</p><p><i>Third</i>, even if a distinct category of information is deemed to be more like cell-site records than financial records, courts and law enforcement officers will have to guess how much of that information can be requested before a warrant is required.  The Court suggests that less than seven days of location information may not require a warrant.  See <i>ante,</i> at 11, n.\xc2\xa03; see also <i>ante,</i> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (expressing no opinion on \xe2\x80\x9creal-time CSLI,\xe2\x80\x9d tower dumps, and security-camera footage).  But the Court does not explain why that is so, and nothing in its opinion even alludes to the considerations that should determine whether greater or lesser thresholds should apply to information like IP addresses or website browsing history.</p><p><i>Fourth</i>, by invalidating the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of court-approved compulsory process in this case, the Court calls into question the subpoena practices of federal and state grand juries, legislatures, and other investigative bodies, as Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explains.  See <i>post, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x9319 (dissenting opinion).  Yet the Court fails even to mention the serious consequences this will have for the proper administration of justice.</p><p>In short, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new and uncharted course will inhibit law enforcement and \xe2\x80\x9ckeep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Riley</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 25) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>This case should be resolved by interpreting accepted property principles as the baseline for reasonable expectations of privacy.  Here the Government did not search anything over which Carpenter could assert ownership or control.  Instead, it issued a court-authorized subpoena to a third party to disclose information it alone owned and controlled.  That should suffice to resolve this case.</p><p>Having concluded, however, that the Government searched Carpenter when it obtained cell-site records from his cell phone service providers, the proper resolution of this case should have been to remand for the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance whether the search was reasonable.  Most courts of appeals, believing themselves bound by <i>Miller</i> and <i>Smith</i>, have not grappled with this question.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reflexive imposition of the warrant requirement obscures important and difficult issues, such as the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to authorize the Government to collect new forms of information using processes that deviate from traditional warrant procedures, and how the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness requirement should apply when the Government uses compulsory process instead of engaging in an actual, physical search.</p><p>These reasons all lead to this respectful dissent.</p><p> </p><p>APPENDIX</p><p></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c<b>\xc2\xa72703.
