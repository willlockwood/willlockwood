From this decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory of New Mexico, the case was now before this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in reversing the judgment below, held, that the act in question did not extend to, or embrace proceedings under the Act of 17th of July, 1862, providing for confiscation of the property of persons engaged in, or aiding and abetting the rebellion, of the correctness of which decision we can entertain no doubt.</p>\n<p>If the district court below could have, under any circumstances, jurisdiction of the case, according to the practice as settled in the cases of the <em>Union Insurance Company v. United States, Armstrong\'s Foundry</em> and <em>St. Louis Street Foundry,</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] decided at the present term, as it has been tried on the admiralty side of the court, the proper disposition of it would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="773">Page 73 U.

But as the supreme court of the territory has reversed the decree of confiscation for the want of jurisdiction, in the correctness of which judgment we concur, the proper disposition of it will be to</p>\n<p><em>Affirm the decree, as this reaches directly the right conclusion in the case.</em></p>\n<p>NOTE.  Like decrees were made in the similar cases of <em>United States v. Crosby</em> and <em>United States v. Gillet,</em> as governed by this one.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>12 Stat. at Large 761.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The last preceding three cases.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
