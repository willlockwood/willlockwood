Argued April 29, 1998-Decided June 1, 1998</p><p>An indictment returned in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri charged respondent Cabrales, as sole defendant, with conspiracy under 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 371 to violate \xc2\xa7 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) (conducting a financial transaction to avoid a transaction-reporting requirement) (Count I), and with money laundering in violation of the latter section (Count II) and \xc2\xa7 1957 (engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000) (Count III). The indictment alleged that, in January 1991, Cabrales deposited $40,000 with the AmSouth Bank of Florida and, within a week, made four separate $9,500 withdrawals from that bank. The money deposited and withdrawn was traceable to illegal cocaine sales in Missouri. Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment in its entirety for improper venue. The District Court denied the motion as to Count I, the conspiracy count, but dismissed Counts II and III, the moneylaundering counts, because the money-laundering activity occurred entirely in Florida. In affirming that dismissal, the Eighth Circuit noted that the Constitution, Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 3, and Arndt. 6, as well as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18, requires that a person be tried where the charged offense was committed. While recognizing that a continuing offense "begun in one district and completed in another ... may be ... prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed," 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3237(a), the court said that Cabrales was not accused of a continuing offense, but was charged with</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="2">2</a></p><p>Syllabus</p><p>money-laundering transactions that began, continued, and were completed only in Florida. It was of no moment that the money came from Missouri, the court explained, because Cabrales dealt with it only in Florida, the money-laundering counts alleged no act committed by Cabrales in Missouri, and the Government did not assert that Cabrales transported the money from Missouri to Florida.</p><p><i>Held: </i>Missouri is not a place of proper venue for the money-laundering offenses with which Cabrales is charged.

Here, the crimes charged in Counts II and III are defined in statutory proscriptions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1956(a)(I)(B)(ii) and 1957, that interdict only the financial transactions (acts located entirely in Florida), not the anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered. Contrary to the Government\'s contention, the crimes charged in those counts do not fit under \xc2\xa7 3237(a) as offenses begun in Missouri and completed in Florida, but are crimes that took place wholly within Florida. Notably, the counts at issue do not charge Cabrales with conspiracy; they do not link her to, or assert her responsibility for, acts done by others. Nor do they charge her as an aider or abettor, punishable as a principal, in the Missouri drug trafficking, see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2. Rather, those counts charge her with criminal activity "after the fact" of an offense begun and completed by others. Cf. \xc2\xa7 3. Whenever a defendant acts "after the fact" to conceal a crime, it might be said, as the Government urges, that the first crime is an essential element of the second, and that the second facilitated the first or made it profitable by impeding its detection. But the question here is the <i>place </i>appropriate to try the "after the fact" actor. It is immaterial whether that actor knew where the first crime was committed.

By contrast, the counts here at issue allege no conspiracy, but describe activity in which Cabrales alone engaged.

Finally, the Court rejects the Government\'s contention that efficiency warrants trying Cabrales in Missouri because evidence there, and not in Florida, shows that the money she allegedly laundered derived from unlawful activity. The Government is not disarmed from showing that Cabrales is in fact linked to the drug trafficking. She can be, and indeed has been, charged with conspiring with the drug dealers in Missouri. If the Government can prove the agreement it has alleged in Count I, Cabrales can be prosecuted in Missouri for that confederacy, and her Florida money laundering could be shown as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. See \xc2\xa7 371. As the Government acknowledged, the difference in her sentence probably would be negligible.

The defendant, respondent Vickie S. Cabrales, is not alleged to have transported funds from Missouri to Florida. Nor is she charged, in the counts before us, with participation in the Missouri cocaine distribution that generated the funds in question.

S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) (Count I); conducting a financial transaction to avoid a transaction-reporting requirement, in violation of \xc2\xa7 1956 (a)(l)(B)(ii) (Count II); and engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000, in violation of \xc2\xa7 1957 (Count III). The indictment alleged that, in January 1991, Cabrales deposited $40,000 with the AmSouth Bank of Florida and, within a week\'s span, made four separate withdrawals of $9,500 each from that bank. The money deposited and withdrawn was traceable to illegal sales of cocaine in Missouri.</p><p>Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment in its entirety for improper venue. On recommendation of the Magistrate, the District Court denied the motion as to Count I, the conspiracy count, based on the Government\'s assertions that Cabrales "was present in Missouri during the conspiracy, lived with a conspirator in Missouri, and participated in various activities in Missouri in furtherance of the conspiracy." App. to Pet. for Cert. lla, 14a-15a. Also on the Magistrate\'s recommendation, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss Counts II and III, the money-laundering counts, because the deposit and withdrawals occurred in Florida and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="5">5</a></p><p>"[n]o activity of money laundering ... occurred in Missouri." <i>Id., </i>at 11a, 14a.</p><p>On the Government\'s appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s dismissal of the money-laundering counts. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/109/471/">109 F.3d 471</a>, as amended, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/115/621/">115 F.3d 621</a> (CA81997).

Their complaints against the King of Great Britain, listed in the Declaration of Independence, included his transportation of colonists "beyond Seas to be tried." 1 The Constitution twice safeguards the defendant\'s venue right: Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 3, instructs that "Trial of all Crimes ... shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed"; the Sixth Amendment calls for trial "by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed." Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing that "prosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was committed," echoes the constitutional commands.</p><p>We adhere to the general guide invoked and applied by the Eighth Circuit: "[T]he <i>locus delicti </i>must be determined</p><p>1 The Declaration recited among injuries and usurpations attributed to the King: "transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences." The Declaration of Independence, para. 21 (1776). A complaint of the same tenor appeared earlier, in the 1769 "Virginia Resolves." See Blume, The Place of Trial of Criminal Cases: Constitutional Vicinage and Venue, 43 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 64 (1944). Parliament had decreed that colonists charged with treason could be tried in England. See 16 Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to Year 1803, pp. 476-510 (T. Hansard ed. 1813). In response, the Virginia House of Burgesses unanimously passed a resolution condemning the practice of sending individuals "beyond the Sea, to be tried" as "highly derogatory of the Rights of British subjects." Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1766-1769, p. 214 (J.

C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii), 1957, that interdict only the financial transactions (acts located entirely in Florida), not the anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered.</p><p>Congress has provided by statute for offenses "begun in one district and completed in another"; such offenses may be "prosecuted in any district in which [the] offense was begun, continued, or completed." 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3237(a). The Government urges that the money-laundering crimes described in Counts II and III of the indictment against Cabrales fit the \xc2\xa7 3237(a) description. We therefore confront and decide this question: Do those counts charge crimes begun in Missouri and completed in Florida, rendering venue proper in Missouri, or do they delineate crimes that took place wholly within Florida?</p><p>Notably, the counts at issue do not charge Cabrales with conspiracy; they do not link her to, or assert her responsibility for, acts done by others. Nor do they charge her as an aider or abettor in the Missouri drug trafficking. See 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2 (one who aids or abets an offense "is punishable as a principal"). Cabrales is charged in the money-laundering counts with criminal activity "after the fact" of an offense begun and completed by others. Cf. \xc2\xa7 3 ("Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, ... assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his ... punishment, is an accessory after the fact," punishable not as a principal, but by a term of imprisonment or fine generally "not more than one-half the maximum ... prescribed for the punishment of the principal[.]").</p><p>Whenever a defendant acts "after the fact" to conceal a crime, it might be said, as the Government urges in this case, that the first crime is an essential element of the second, see Brief for United States 9, and that the second</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="8">8</a></p><p>facilitated the first or made it profitable by impeding its detection, see <i>id., </i>at 14. But the question here is the <i>place </i>appropriate to try the "after the fact" actor. As the Government recognizes, it is immaterial whether that actor knew where the first crime was committed. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6. The money launderer must know she is dealing with funds derived from "specified unlawful activity," here, drug trafficking, but the Missouri venue of that activity is, as the Eighth Circuit said, "of no moment." 109 F. 3d, at 472.2</p><p>Money laundering, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, arguably might rank as a "continuing offense," triable in more than one place, if the launderer acquired the funds in one district and transported them into another. <i>Id., </i>at 473. But that is tellingly not this case. In the counts at issue, the Government indicted Cabrales "for transactions which began, continued, and were completed only in Florida." <i>Id., </i>at 472. Under these circumstances, venue in Missouri is improper.</p><p>The Government identified <i>Hyde </i>v. <i>United States, 225 </i>U.

Neither decision warrants the ruling the Government here seeks.</p><p>In <i>Hyde, </i>the defendants were convicted in the District of Columbia of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Although none of the defendants had entered the District as part of the conspiracy, venue was nevertheless appropriate, the Court ruled, based on the overt acts of a co-conspirator there. 225 U. S., at 363. By contrast, the counts at issue in this case allege no conspiracy. They describe activity in which Cabrales alone, untied to others, engaged.</p><p>2 Cf. United States v.

The Court held that the defendant could be prosecuted in Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received. 136 U. S., at 266-268. The <i>Palliser </i>opinion simply recognizes that a mailing to Connecticut is properly ranked as an act completed in that State. Cf. 18 U. S.

Cabrales, however, dispatched no missive from one State into another. The counts before us portray her and the money she deposited and withdrew as moving inside Florida only.</p><p>Finally, the Government urges the efficiency of trying Cabrales in Missouri, because evidence in that State, and not in Florida, shows that the money Cabrales allegedly laundered derived from unlawful activity.
