He has not attempted this in the slightest degree, there being a total absence of all evidence in his favor, and therefore, as the case remains with all its original imperfections, the decree of the circuit court is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
