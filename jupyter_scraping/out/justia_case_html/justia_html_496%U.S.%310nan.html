In No. 89-1434, the United States prosecuted other appellees for violating the Act by knowingly setting fire to a United States flag while protesting the Act\'s passage.

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The United States appealed both decisions directly to this Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \xc2\xa7 700(d) (Supp.1990).

The Texas statute provided that "[a] person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly desecrates . . . [a] national flag," where "desecrate" meant to "deface, damage, or otherwise physically mistreat in a way that the actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action."  Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 42.09 (1989).  We first held that Johnson\'s flag-burning was "conduct <em>sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\' to implicate the First Amendment.\'" 491 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/case.html#406">491 U.

S. 405</a></span>-406, but invites us to reconsider our rejection in <em>Johnson</em> of the claim that flag-burning as a mode of expression, like obscenity or "fighting words," does not enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment.  <em>Cf. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html">315 U.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The only remaining question is whether the Flag Protection Act is sufficiently distinct from the Texas statute that it may constitutionally be applied to proscribe appellees\' expressive conduct.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that the Flag Protection Act is constitutional because, unlike the statute addressed in <em>Johnson,</em> the Act does not target expressive conduct on the basis of the content of its message.  The Government asserts an interest in "protect[ing] the physical integrity of the flag under all circumstances" in order to safeguard the flag\'s identity "<em>as the unique and unalloyed symbol of the Nation.\'"  Brief for United States 28, 29.  The Act proscribes conduct (other than disposal) that damages or mistreats a flag, without regard to the actor\'s motive, his intended message, or the likely effects of his conduct on onlookers.  By contrast, the Texas statute expressly prohibited only those acts of physical flag desecration "that the actor knows will seriously offend" onlookers, and the former federal statute prohibited only those acts of desecration that "cas[t] contempt upon" the flag.\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the Flag Protection Act contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the Government\'s asserted interest is "related <em>to the suppression of free expression,\'" 491 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/case.html#410">491 U.

S. 316</a></em></p><p><em> of a privately owned flag [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] rests upon a perceived need to preserve the flag\'s status as a symbol of our Nation and certain national ideals.  But the mere destruction or disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way.  For example, the secret destruction of a flag in one\'s own basement would not threaten the flag\'s recognized meaning.  Rather, the Government\'s desire to preserve the flag as a symbol for certain national ideals is implicated "only when a person\'s treatment of the flag communicates [a] message" to others that is inconsistent with those ideals.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  And the explicit exemption in \xc2\xa7 700(a)(2) for disposal of "worn or soiled" flags protects certain acts traditionally associated with patriotic respect for the flag.

Appellant\'s <em>amicus</em> asserts that the Government has a legitimate non-speech-related interest in safeguarding this "eminently practical legal aspect of the flag, as an incident of sovereignty."  Brief for the Speaker and the Leadership Group of the United States House of Representatives [as] <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25.  This interest has firm historical roots:</p>\n<p>"While the symbolic role of the flag is now well established, the flag was an important incident of sovereignty before it was used for symbolic purposes by patriots and others.  When the nation\'s founders first determined to adopt a national flag, they intended to serve specific functions relating to our status as a sovereign nation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 9; <em>see id.</em> at 5 (noting "flag\'s <em>historic function\' for such sovereign purposes as marking `our national presence in schools, public buildings, battleships and airplanes\'") (citation omitted).\n</em></p>\n<p>We concede that the Government has a legitimate interest in preserving the flag\'s function as an "incident of sovereignty," though we need not address today the extent to which this interest may justify any laws regulating conduct that would thwart this core function, as might a commercial or like appropriation of the image of the United States flag.  <em>Amicus</em> does not, and cannot, explain how a statute that penalizes anyone who knowingly burns, mutilates, or defiles any American flag is designed to advance this asserted interest in maintaining the association between the flag and the Nation.  Burning a flag does not threaten to interfere with this association in any way; indeed, the flag-burner\'s message depends in part on the viewer\'s ability to make this very association.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, "defile" is defined as "to make filthy; to corrupt the purity or perfection of; to rob of chastity; to make ceremonially unclean; tarnish; dishonor."  Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 592 (1976).

Of course "the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."  <em>Ante</em> this page.  None of us disagrees with that proposition.  But it is equally well settled that certain methods of expression may be prohibited if (a) the prohibition is supported by a legitimate societal interest that is unrelated to suppression of the ideas the speaker desires to express; (b) the prohibition does not entail any interference with the speaker\'s freedom to express those ideas by other means; and (c) the interest in allowing the speaker complete freedom of choice among alternative methods of expression is less important than the societal interest supporting the prohibition.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the position taken by counsel for the flag burners in <em>Texas v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/case.html">491 U. S. 397</a></span> (1989), it is now conceded that the Federal Government has a legitimate interest in protecting the symbolic value of the American flag.  Obviously that value cannot be measured, or even described, with any precision.  It has at least these two components:  in times of national crisis, it inspires and motivates the average citizen to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve societal goals of overriding importance; at all times, it serves as a reminder </p><p><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 496 U. S. 320</a></p><p> of the paramount importance of pursuing the ideals that characterize our society.</p>\n<p>The first question the Court should consider is whether the interest in preserving the value of that symbol is unrelated to suppression of the ideas that flag burners are trying to express.  In my judgment, the answer depends, at least in part, on what those ideas are.  A flag burner might intend various messages.  The flag burner may wish simply to convey hatred, contempt, or sheer opposition directed at the United States.  This might be the case if the flag were burned by an enemy during time of war.  A flag burner may also, or instead, seek to convey the depth of his personal conviction about some issue by willingly provoking the use of force against himself.  In so doing, he says that "my disagreement with certain policies is so strong that I am prepared to risk physical harm (and perhaps imprisonment) in order to call attention to my views."  This second possibility apparently describes the expressive conduct of the flag burners in these cases.  Like the protesters who dramatized their opposition to our engagement in Vietnam by publicly burning their draft cards --  and who were punished for doing so -- their expressive conduct is consistent with affection for this country and respect for the ideals that the flag symbolizes.  There is at least one further possibility:  a flag burner may intend to make an accusation against the integrity of the American people who disagree with him.  By burning the embodiment of America\'s collective commitment to freedom and equality, the flag burner charges that the majority has forsaken that commitment -- that continued respect for the flag is nothing more than hypocrisy.  Such a charge may be made even if the flag burner loves the country and zealously pursues the ideals that the country claims to honor.</p>\n<p>The idea expressed by a particular act of flag burning is necessarily dependent on the temporal and political context in which it occurs.  In the 1960\'s, it may have expressed opposition to the country\'s Vietnam policies, or at least to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 496 U. S. 321</a></p><p> compulsory draft.  In <em>Texas v. Johnson,</em> it apparently expressed opposition to the platform of the Republican Party.  In these cases, the respondents have explained that it expressed their opposition to racial discrimination, to the failure to care for the homeless, and of course to statutory prohibitions of flag burning.  In any of these examples, the protestors may wish both to say that their own position is the only one faithful to liberty and equality and to accuse their fellow citizens of hypocritical indifference to -- or even of a selfish departure from -- the ideals which the flag is supposed to symbolize.  The ideas expressed by flag burners are thus various, and often ambiguous.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s legitimate interest in preserving the symbolic value of the flag is, however, essentially the same regardless of which of many different ideas may have motivated a particular act of flag burning.  As I explained in my dissent in <em>Johnson,</em> 491 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/428/case.html#436">419 U. S. 436</a></span>-439, the flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality, and tolerance --  ideas that Americans have passionately defended and debated throughout our history.  The flag embodies the spirit of our national commitment to those ideals.  The message thereby transmitted does not take a stand upon our disagreements, except to say that those disagreements are best regarded as competing interpretations of shared ideals.  It does not judge particular policies, except to say that they command respect when they are enlightened by the spirit of liberty and equality.  To the world, the flag is our promise that we will continue to strive for these ideals.  To us, the flag is a reminder both that the struggle for liberty and equality is unceasing and that our obligation of tolerance and respect for all of our fellow citizens encompasses those who disagree with us -- indeed, even those whose ideas are disagreeable or offensive.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Government may -- indeed, it should -- protect the symbolic value of the flag without regard to the specific content of the flag burners\' speech.  The prosecution in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="322">Page 496 U. S. 322</a></p><p> case does not depend upon the object of the defendants\' protest.  It is, moreover, equally clear that the prohibition does not entail any interference with the speaker\'s freedom to express his or her ideas by other means.  It may well be true that other means of expression may be less effective in drawing attention to those ideas, but that is not itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning.  Presumably a gigantic fireworks display or a parade of nude models in a public park might draw even more attention to a controversial message, but such methods of expression are nevertheless subject to regulation.</p>\n<p>This case therefore comes down to a question of judgment.  Does the admittedly important interest in allowing every speaker to choose the method of expressing his or her ideas that he or she deems most effective and appropriate outweigh the societal interest in preserving the symbolic value of the flag?  This question, in turn, involves three different judgments:  (1) The importance of the individual interest in selecting the preferred means of communication; (2) the importance of the national symbol; and (3) the question whether tolerance of flag burning will enhance or tarnish that value.  The opinions in <em>Texas v. Johnson</em> demonstrate that reasonable judges may differ with respect to each of these judgments.</p>\n<p>The individual interest is unquestionably a matter of great importance.  Indeed, it is one of the critical components of the idea of liberty that the flag itself is intended to symbolize.  Moreover, it is buttressed by the societal interest in being alerted to the need for thoughtful response to voices that might otherwise go unheard.  The freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment embraces not only the freedom to communicate particular ideas but also the right to communicate them effectively.  That right, however, is not absolute -- the communicative value of a well-placed bomb in the Capitol does not entitle it to the protection of the First Amendment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="323">Page 496 U. S. 323</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Burning a flag is not, of course, equivalent to burning a public building.  Assuming that the protester is burning his own flag, it causes no physical harm to other persons or to their property.  The impact is purely symbolic, and it is apparent that some thoughtful persons believe that impact, far from depreciating the value of the symbol, will actually enhance its meaning.  I most respectfully disagree.  Indeed, what makes this case particularly difficult for me is what I regard as the damage to the symbol that has already occurred as a result of this Court\'s decision to place its stamp of approval on the act of flag burning.  A formerly dramatic expression of protest is now rather commonplace.  In today\'s marketplace of ideas, the public burning of a Vietnam draft card is probably less provocative than lighting a cigarette.  Tomorrow, flag burning may produce a similar reaction.  There is surely a direct relationship between the communicative value of the act of flag burning and the symbolic value of the object being burned.</p>\n<p>The symbolic value of the American flag is not the same today as it was yesterday.  Events during the last three decades have altered the country\'s image in the eyes of numerous Americans, and some now have difficulty understanding the message that the flag conveyed to their parents and grandparents -- whether born abroad and naturalized or native born.  Moreover, the integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by individuals whom it offends, or who seem to manipulate the symbol of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about meaner ends.  And, as I have suggested, the residual value of the symbol after this Court\'s decision in <em>Texas v. Johnson</em> is surely not the same as it was a year ago.</p>\n<p>Given all these considerations, plus the fact that the Court today is really doing nothing more than reconfirming what it has already decided, it might be appropriate to defer to the judgment of the majority and merely apply the doctrine of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 496 U. S. 324</a></p><p> <em>stare decisis</em> to the case at hand.  That action, however, would not honestly reflect my considered judgment concerning the relative importance of the conflicting interests that are at stake.  I remain persuaded that the considerations identified in my opinion in <em>Texas v. Johnson</em> are of controlling importance in this case as well.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
