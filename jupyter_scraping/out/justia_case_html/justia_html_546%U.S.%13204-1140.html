FRANKLIN CAPITAL CORP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">MARTIN et ux <em>v</em>. FRANKLIN CAPITAL CORP.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x931140.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 8, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 7, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">In removing petitioner Martins\xe2\x80\x99 state-court class action to federal court on diversity grounds, respondents (collectively, Franklin) acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the state-court complaint, but argued that this requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied under precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees could be aggregated in making the calculation.  The District Court denied the Martins\xe2\x80\x99 motion to remand to state court and eventually dismissed the case with prejudice.  Reversing and remanding with instructions to remand to state court, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that their suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement and rejected Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s aggregation theory under decisions issued after the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand decision.  The latter court then denied the Martins\xe2\x80\x99 motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees because Franklin had legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within federal-court jurisdiction.  Affirming, the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the Martins\xe2\x80\x99 argument that attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should be granted on remand as a matter of course under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71447(c), which provides that a remand order \xe2\x80\x9cmay require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees,\xe2\x80\x9d but provides little guidance on when fees are warranted.  The court noted that fee awards are left to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, subject to review only for abuse of discretion; pointed out that, under Circuit precedent, the key factor in deciding whether to award fees is the propriety of removal; and held that, because Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, its basis for removal was objectively reasonable, and the fee denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Absent unusual circumstances, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should not be awarded under \xc2\xa71447(c) when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.  Conversely, where no objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be awarded.  This Court rejects the Martins\xe2\x80\x99 argument for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees.  The reasons for adopting such a presumption in <em>Newman</em> v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/index.html">390 U. S. 400</a>, 402 <em>(per curiam), </em>are absent here.  Also rejected is Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa71447(c) simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when otherwise warranted.  Were the statute strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit awards to \xe2\x80\x9cjust\xe2\x80\x9d costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be \xe2\x80\x9cjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court therefore gives the statute its natural reading: Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an award is just.  That standard need not be defined narrowly, as the Solicitor General argues, by awarding fees only on a showing that the unsuccessful party\xe2\x80\x99s position was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  <em>Christiansburg Garment Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/412/index.html">434 U. S. 412</a>, 422, and <em>Flight Attendants</em> v. <em>Zipes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/754/index.html">491 U. S. 754</a>, 762, distinguished.  The fact that a \xc2\xa71447(c) fee award is discretionary does not mean that there is no governing legal standard.  When applying fee-shifting statutes, the Court has found limits in \xe2\x80\x9cthe large objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of the relevant Act.  <em>E.g., Zipes</em>, 491 U. S.<em>, </em>at 759.  The appropriate test for awarding fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) should recognize Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to deter removals intended to prolong litigation and impose costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.  In light of these \xe2\x80\x9clarge objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal.  In applying the general rule of reasonableness, district courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure in a given case.  A court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for departing, however, should be \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful to the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of awarding fees under \xc2\xa71447(c).  <em>Fogerty</em> v. <em>Fantasy, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/517/index.html">510 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  If it appears that the federal court lacks jurisdiction, however, \xe2\x80\x9cthe case shall be remanded.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71447(c).  An order remanding a removed case to state court \xe2\x80\x9cmay require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Although \xc2\xa71447(c) expressly permits an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, it provides little guidance on when such fees are warranted.  We granted certiorari to determine the proper standard for awarding attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when remanding a case to state court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners Gerald and Juana Martin filed a class-action lawsuit in New Mexico state court against respondents Franklin Capital Corporation and Century-National Insurance Company (collectively, Franklin).  Franklin removed the case to Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332, 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  In its removal notice, Franklin acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the complaint\xe2\x80\x94no reason it should be, since the complaint had been filed in state court\xe2\x80\x94but argued that this requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied.  In so arguing, Franklin relied in part on precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees could be aggregated in a class action to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.  See App. 35.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifteen months later, the Martins moved to remand to state court on the ground that their claims failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  The District Court denied the motion and eventually dismissed the case with prejudice.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that the suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  The Tenth Circuit rejected Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s contention that punitive damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees could be aggregated in calculating the amount in controversy, in part on the basis of decisions issued after the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand decision.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the District Court with instructions to remand the case to state court.  251 F.\xc2\xa03d 1284, 1294 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Back before the District Court, the Martins moved for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71447(c).  The District Court reviewed Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s basis for removal and concluded that, although the Court of Appeals had determined that removal was improper, Franklin \xe2\x80\x9chad legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within th[e] Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.  Because Franklin \xe2\x80\x9chad objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court denied the Martins\xe2\x80\x99 request for fees.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Martins appealed again, arguing that \xc2\xa71447(c) requires granting attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees on remand as a matter of course.  The Tenth Circuit disagreed, noting that awarding fees is left to the \xe2\x80\x9cwide discretion\xe2\x80\x9d of the district court, subject to review only for abuse of discretion.  393 F.\xc2\xa03d 1143, 1146 (2004).  Under Tenth Circuit precedent, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98key factor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding whether to award fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the propriety of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s removal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Excell, Inc.</em> v. <em>Sterling Boiler &amp; Mechanical, Inc.</em>, 106 F.\xc2\xa03d 318, 322 (CA10 1997)).  In calculating the amount in controversy when it removed the case, Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, and therefore Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s basis for removal was objectively reasonable.  393 F. 3d, at 1148.  Because the District Court had not abused its discretion in denying fees, the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1151.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. ___ (2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits concerning when attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should be awarded under \xc2\xa71447(c).  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hornbuckle</em> v. <em>State Farm Lloyds</em>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d 538, 541 (CA5 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cFees should only be awarded if the removing defendant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)), with <em>Sirotzky</em> v. <em>New York Stock Exchange</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 985, 987 (CA7 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]rovided removal was improper, the plaintiff is <em>presumptively</em> entitled to an award of fees\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>Hofler</em> v. <em>Aetna U. S. Healthcare of Cal., Inc.</em>, 296 F.\xc2\xa03d 764, 770 (CA9 2002) (affirming fee award even when \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s position may be fairly supportable\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We hold that, absent unusual circumstances, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should not be awarded when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Martins argue that attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should be awarded automatically on remand, or that there should at least be a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees.  Section 1447(c), however, provides that a remand order \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d require payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshould.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court in <em>Fogerty</em> v. <em>Fantasy, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/517/index.html"></a><a href="/us/510/517/index.html">510 U. S. 517</a>, 533 (1994), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98may\xe2\x80\x99 clearly connotes discretion.  The automatic awarding of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the prevailing party would pretermit the exercise of that discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d often enough in \xc2\xa71447(c)\xe2\x80\x94as when it specified that removed cases apparently outside federal jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cshall be remanded\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to dissuade us from the conclusion that it meant \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d when it used \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in authorizing an award of fees.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Martins are on somewhat stronger ground in pressing for a presumption in favor of awarding fees.  As they explain, we interpreted a statute authorizing a discretionary award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights cases to nonetheless give rise to such a presumption.  <em>Newman</em> v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/index.html">390 U. S. 400</a>, 402 (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  But this case is not at all like <em>Piggie Park</em>.  In <em>Piggie Park</em>, we concluded that a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights suit serves as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98private attorney general,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d helping to ensure compliance with civil rights laws and benefiting the public by \xe2\x80\x9cvindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We also later explained that the <em>Piggie Park</em> standard was appropriate in that case because the civil rights defendant, who is required to pay the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, has violated federal law.  See <em>Flight Attendants</em> v. <em>Zipes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/754/index.html">491 U. S. 754</a>, 762 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cOur cases have emphasized the crucial connection between liability for violation of federal law and liability for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under federal fee-shifting statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, plaintiffs do not serve as private attorneys general when they secure a remand to state court, nor is it reasonable to view the defendants as violators of federal law.  To the contrary, the removal statute grants defendants a right to a federal forum.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  A remand is necessary if a defendant improperly asserts this right, but incorrectly invoking a federal right is not comparable to violating substantive federal law.  The reasons for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees that were present in <em>Piggie Park</em> are accordingly absent here.  In the absence of such reasons, we are left with no sound basis for a similar presumption.  Instead, had Congress intended to award fees as a matter of course to a party that successfully obtains a remand, we think that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch a bold departure from traditional practice would have surely drawn more explicit statutory language and legislative comment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fogerty</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 534.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For its part, Franklin begins by arguing that \xc2\xa71447(c) provides little guidance on when fees should be shifted because it is not a fee-shifting statute at all.  According to Franklin, the provision simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when otherwise warranted, for example when Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 supports awarding fees.  Although Franklin is correct that the predecessor to \xc2\xa71447(c) was enacted, in part, because courts would otherwise lack jurisdiction to award costs on remand, see <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Swan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/index.html">111 U. S. 379</a>, 386\xe2\x80\x93387 (1884), there is no reason to assume Congress went no further than conferring jurisdiction when it acted.  Congress could have determined that the most efficient way to cure this jurisdictional defect was to create a substantive basis for ordering costs.  The text supports this view.  If the statute were strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit awards to \xe2\x80\x9cjust\xe2\x80\x9d costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be \xe2\x80\x9cjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  We therefore give the statute its natural reading: Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an award is just.  The question remains how to define that standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General would define the standard narrowly, arguing that fees should be awarded only on a showing that the unsuccessful party\xe2\x80\x99s position was \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the standard we have adopted for awarding fees against unsuccessful plaintiffs in civil rights cases, see <em>Christiansburg Garment Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/412/index.html">434 U. S. 412</a>, 421 (1978), and unsuccessful intervenors in such cases, see <em>Zipes,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 762.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  But just as there is no basis for supposing Congress meant to tilt the exercise of discretion in <em>favor</em> of fee awards under \xc2\xa71447(c), as there was in <em>Piggie Park</em>, so too there is no basis here for a strong bias <em>against</em> fee awards, as there was in <em>Christiansburg Garment</em> and <em>Zipes</em>.  The statutory language and context strike us as more evenly balanced between a pro-award and anti-award position than was the case in either <em>Piggie Park</em> or <em>Christiansburg Garment</em> and <em>Zipes;</em> we see nothing to persuade us that fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) should either usually be granted or usually be denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that an award of fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) is left to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, with no heavy congressional thumb on either side of the scales, does not mean that no legal standard governs that discretion.  We have it on good authority that \xe2\x80\x9ca motion to [a court\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Discretion is not whim, and limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike.  See Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.\xc2\xa0J. 747, 758 (1982).  For these reasons, we have often limited courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to award fees despite the absence of express legislative restrictions.  That is, of course, what we did in <em>Piggie Park</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 402 (A prevailing plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust\xe2\x80\x9d), <em>Christiansburg Garment</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 422 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>Zipes,</em> 491 U. S., at 761 (Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should be awarded against intervenors \xe2\x80\x9conly where the intervenors\xe2\x80\x99 action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Zipes</em>, we reaffirmed the principle on which these decisions are based: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the text of the provision does not specify any limits upon the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to allow or disallow fees, in a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 758.  <em>Zipes</em> also explains how to discern the limits on a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  When applying fee-shifting statutes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have found limits in  \xe2\x80\x98the large objectives\xe2\x80\x99 of the relevant Act, which embrace certain \xe2\x80\x98equitable considerations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 759 (citation omitted).*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By enacting the removal statute, Congress granted a right to a federal forum to a limited class of state-court defendants.  If fee shifting were automatic, defendants might choose to exercise this right only in cases where the right to remove was obvious.  See <em>Christiansburg Garment</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 422 (awarding fees simply because the party did not prevail \xe2\x80\x9ccould discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a [party] be sure of ultimate success\xe2\x80\x9d).  But there is no reason to suppose Congress meant to confer a right to remove, while at the same time discouraging its exercise in all but obvious cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, however, would not have enacted \xc2\xa71447(c) if its only concern were avoiding deterrence of proper removals.  Instead, Congress thought fee shifting appropriate in some cases.  The process of removing a case to federal court and then having it remanded back to state court delays resolution of the case, imposes additional costs on both parties, and wastes judicial resources.  Assessing costs and fees on remand reduces the attractiveness of removal as a method for delaying litigation and imposing costs on the plaintiff.  The appropriate test for awarding fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) should recognize the desire to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98large objectives,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zipes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 759, the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal.  Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.  Conversely, when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hornbuckle</em>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 541; <em>Valdes</em> v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</em>, 199 F.\xc2\xa03d 290, 293 (CA5 2000).  In applying this rule, district courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the rule in a given case.  For instance, a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s delay in seeking remand or failure to disclose facts necessary to determine jurisdiction may affect the decision to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  When a court exercises its discretion in this manner, however, its reasons for departing from the general rule should be \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful to the purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of awarding fees under \xc2\xa71447(c).  <em>Fogerty</em>, 510 U.
