JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal under \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut upholding the constitutionality of a state statute.  Chapter 308 of the Public Acts of Connecticut of 1927 (printed in the margin <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/280/117/case.html">*</a></span>) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 280 U. S. 122</a></p><p> provides that no person carried gratuitously as a guest in an automobile may recover from the owner or operator for injuries caused by its negligent operation.  The appellant brought suit in the Superior Court of New Haven county against appellee, her husband, for injuries so sustained.  Judgment for the defendant was affirmed by the Supreme Court.  Both courts ruled that the statute barred appellant, a guest carried gratuitously, from recovery for injuries caused by ordinary negligence in the operation of the car, and the Supreme Court, by divided bench, held that the statute did not deny to appellant the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  108 Conn. 371, 143 A. 240.</p>\n<p>As the record does not disclose the constitutional grounds on which the appellant challenged the validity of the statute, our review will be limited to the single question arising under the federal Constitution which was considered in the opinion of the court below.  <em>Saltonstall v. Saltonstall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/260/case.html">276 U. S. 260</a></span>.  We need not, therefore, elaborate the rule that the Constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old ones recognized by the common law, to attain a permissible legislative object.  <em>See Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/112/case.html">274 U.

S. 74</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The use of the automobile as an instrument of transportation is peculiarly the subject of regulation.  We cannot assume that there are no evils to be corrected or permissible social objects to be gained by the present statute.  We are not unaware of the increasing frequency of litigation in which passengers carried gratuitously in automobiles, often casual guests or licensees, have sought the recovery of large sums for injuries alleged to have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 280 U. S. 123</a></p><p> been due to negligent operation.  In some jurisdictions, it has been judicially determined that a lower standard of care should be exacted where the carriage in any type of vehicle is gratuitous.  <em>See Massaletti v. Fitzroy,</em> 228 Mass. 487; <em>Marcienowski v. Sanders,</em> 252 Mass. 65; <em>Epps v. Parrish,</em> 26 Ga.App. 399.  Whether there has been a serious increase in the evils of vexatious litigation in this class of cases where the carriage is by automobile is for legislative determination, and, if found, may well be the basis of legislative action further restricting the liability.  Its wisdom is not the concern of courts.</p>\n<p>It is said that the vice in the statute is not that it distinguishes between passengers who pay and those who do not, but between gratuitous passengers in automobiles and those in other classes of vehicles.  But it is not so evident that no grounds exist for the distinction that we can say <em>a priori</em> that the classification is one forbidden as without basis and arbitrary.  <em>See Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/392/case.html">274 U. S. 392</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/392/case.html#397">274 U. S. 397</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Granted that the liability to be imposed upon those who operate any kind of vehicle for the benefit of a mere guest or licensee is an appropriate subject of legislative restriction, there is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied -- that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none.  <em>Patsone v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/138/case.html">232 U.

In this day of almost universal highway transportation by motorcar, we cannot say that abuses originating in the multiplicity of suits growing out of the gratuitous carriage of passengers in automobiles do not present so conspicuous an example of what the legislature may regard as an evil as to justify </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 280 U.
