Respondent filed suit, asserting, as relevant here, that Northwest had breached its contract by revoking his membership status without valid cause and had violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable expectations.  The District Court found that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim and dismissed the breach of contract claim without prejudice.

And because that Act contained a saving provision preserving pre-existing statutory and common-law remedies, air carriers were also regulated by the States.  The ADA did not repeal that saving provision, but it did include a pre-emption provision to prohibit States from \xe2\x80\x9cenact[ing] or enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to [an air carrier\xe2\x80\x99s] price, route, or service,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741713(b)(1), thus ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9cStates would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,\xe2\x80\x9d Morales v.

In Morales, the Court recognized that the key phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d expresses a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad pre-emptive purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 383, and held that the ADA pre-empted the use of state consumer protection laws to regulate airline advertising, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] a connection with, or reference to, airline \xe2\x80\x98rates, routes, or services,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 384.  And in American Airlines, Inc. v.

Common-law rules are routinely called \xe2\x80\x9cprovisions,\xe2\x80\x9d see, e.g., Madsen v. Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Center, Inc.,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753\n, n.\xc2\xa03, and they clearly have \xe2\x80\x9cthe force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  The pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x99s original language confirms this understanding.  As first enacted, the provision also applied to \xe2\x80\x9crule[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstandard[s],\xe2\x80\x9d a formulation encompassing common-law rules.  See CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 658\n.  And Congress made clear that the deletion of those terms as part of Title 49\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale recodification effected no \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive change.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71(a),\n\n108Stat.\n745.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 51\n, is misplaced.  There, the Court held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but that Act\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision is more narrowly worded than the ADA provision.  The Boat Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s saving and pre-emption provisions were also enacted at the same time, while the Federal Aviation Act\xe2\x80\x99s general remedies saving clause is \xe2\x80\x9ca relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption regime,\xe2\x80\x9d Morales, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 385, that \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s central purpose, which was to eliminate federal regulation of rates, routes, and services so they could be set by market forces.  Finally, if all state common-law rules fell outside the pre-emption provision\xe2\x80\x99s ambit, Wolens would not have singled out a subcategory, for common-law claims based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary undertaking, as falling outside that provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crates, routes, or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  It clearly has \xe2\x80\x9ca connection with or reference to airline\xe2\x80\x9d prices, routes, or services, Morales, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384.  As in Wolens, Northwest\xe2\x80\x99s program connects to the airline\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crates\xe2\x80\x9d by awarding mileage credits redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing ticket prices.  It also connects to \xe2\x80\x9cservices,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., access to flights and higher service categories.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counterarguments are unpersuasive.  His claim that he is contesting his termination, not access to flights or upgrades, ignores his reason for seeking reinstatement: to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services.  Although respondent and amici claim there have been fundamental changes in the way that frequent flyer miles are earned since Wolens was decided, that does not matter here where respondent did not assert that he earned miles from any activity but taking flights or that he attempted to redeem miles for anything but tickets and upgrades.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        2.\xc2\xa0Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge his contractual agreement with petitioners, it is pre-empted by \xc2\xa741713(b)(1).  Under Minnesota law, which controls here, the implied covenant must be regarded as a state-imposed obligation.  Minnesota law does not permit parties to contract out of the covenant.  And when a State\xe2\x80\x99s law does not authorize parties to free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under Wolens.  As an independent basis for this conclusion, if, as Minnesota law provides, the implied covenant applies to \xe2\x80\x9cevery contract\xe2\x80\x9d except employment contracts  for \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d then the decision not to exempt other types of contracts must likewise be based on a policy determination, namely, that the policy reason for the employment contract rule does not apply in other contexts.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners claim that the refusal to pre-empt all implied covenant claims, regardless of state law, will lead to a patchwork of rules that will frustrate the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s deregulatory aim.  But airlines can avoid such a result if they contract out of covenants where permitted by state law.  Nor are participants in frequent flyer programs left without protection.  They can avoid an airline with a poor reputation and possibly enroll in a more favorable rival program.  Moreover, the Department of Transportation has the authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs.  Finally, respondent might have been able to vindicate his claim of ill treatment by Northwest had he appealed his breach of contract claim.

Following our interpretation of the Act in American Airlines, Inc. v.

(Northwest), established a frequent flyer program, its World-Perks Airline Partners Program, to attract loyal cus-tomers.  Under this program, members are able to earn \xe2\x80\x9cmiles\xe2\x80\x9d by taking flights operated by Northwest and other \xe2\x80\x9cpartner\xe2\x80\x9d airlines.

Second, the complaint claimed that Northwest violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable expectations with respect to the manner in which Northwest would exercise its discretion.  Third, the complaint asserted a claim for negligent misrepresentation, and fourth, the complaint alleged intentional misrepresentation.

These claims, the court concluded, were \xe2\x80\x9crelate[d] to\xe2\x80\x9d Northwest\xe2\x80\x99s rates and services and thus fell within the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause.

The court held that respondent had failed to identify any material breach because the frequent flyer agreement gave Northwest sole discretion to determine whether a participant had abused the program.  Respondent appealed the dismissal of his breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim but not the other claims that the court had dismissed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Ninth Circuit reversed.  695 F.\xc2\xa03d 873 (2012).  Relying on pre-Wolens Circuit precedent, the Ninth Circuit first held that a breach of implied covenant claim is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger preemption under the ADA.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  695 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 879.

Pursuant to this authority, the Board closely regulated air carriers, controlling, among other things, routes, rates, and services.  See, e.g., Western Air Lines, Inc. v. CAB,\n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 67 (1954)\n; Federal Aviation Act of 1958,\n\n72Stat.\n731.  And since the Federal Aviation Act contained a saving provision preserving pre-existing statu-tory and common-law remedies, \xc2\xa71106, id., at 798, air carriers were also regulated by the States.  See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374,\n378 (1992)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 1978, however, Congress enacted the ADA, which sought to promote \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency, innovation, and low prices\xe2\x80\x9d in the airline industry through \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum reliance on competitive market forces and on actual and potential competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa740101(a)(6), (12)(A).

In its current form, this provision states that \xe2\x80\x9ca State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of at least 2 States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa741713(b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have had two occasions to consider the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive reach.  In Morales, we held that the ADApre-empted the use of state consumer protection laws to regulate airline advertising.  We recognized that the key phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d expresses a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad pre-emptive purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 383.  Noting our interpretation of similar language in the pre-emption provision of the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71144(a), we held that a claim \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to rates, routes, or services,\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the ADA, if the claim \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] a connection with, or reference to, airline \xe2\x80\x98rates, routes, or services.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384.  The older saving provision, we concluded, did not undermine this conclusion.  Id., at 384\xe2\x80\x93385.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Subsequently, in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens,\n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219 (1995)\n, we considered the application of the ADA pre-emption provision to two types of claims concerning an airline\xe2\x80\x99s frequent flyer program: first, claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act challenging an airline\xe2\x80\x99s devaluation of earned miles (chiefly as the result of the imposition of \xe2\x80\x9cblackout dates\xe2\x80\x9d and limits on the number of seats available for customers wishing to obtain tickets by using those miles) and, second, breach of contract claims.  We reaffirmed Morales\xe2\x80\x99 broad interpretation of the ADA pre-emption provision and held that this provision barred the claims based on the Illinois statute but not the breach-of-contract claims.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]erms and conditions airlines offer and passengers accept,\xe2\x80\x9d we wrote, \xe2\x80\x9care privately ordered obligations and thus do not amount to a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98enact[ment] or enforce[ment] [of] any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of [the ADA pre-emption provision].\xe2\x80\x9d  513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228\xe2\x80\x93229.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With this background in mind, we turn to the question whether the ADA pre-empts respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first question we address is whether, as respondent now maintains, the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision applies only to legislation enacted by a state legislature and regulations issued by a state administrative agency but not to a common-law rule like the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  We have little difficulty rejecting this argument.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        To begin, state common-law rules fall comfortably within the language of the ADA pre-emption provision.  As noted above, the current version of this provision applies to state \xe2\x80\x9claw[s], regulation[s], or other provision[s] having the force and effect of law,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741713(b)(1).  It is routine to call common-law rules \xe2\x80\x9cprovisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., Madsen v. Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Center, Inc.,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753,\n765, n.\n3 (1994)\n; United States v. Barnett,\n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 681\n\xe2\x80\x93700 (1964); Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., 720 F.\xc2\xa03d 60, 68 (CA1 2013) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen read in context, the word \xe2\x80\x98provision\xe2\x80\x99 in the ADA preemption provision can most appropriately be construed to include common law\xe2\x80\x9d).  And a common-law rule clearly has \xe2\x80\x9cthe force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  In Wolens, we noted that this phrase is most naturally read to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98refe[r] to binding standards of conduct that operate irrespective of any private agreement,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 229, n. 5, and we see no basis for holding that such standards must be based on a statute or regulation as opposed to the common law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This understanding becomes even clearer when the original wording of the pre-emption provision is taken into account.  When first enacted in 1978, this provision also applied to \xe2\x80\x9crule[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstandard[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and there surely can be no doubt that this formulation encompassed common-law rules.  Indeed, we held in CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 658,\n664 (1993)\n, that virtually identical language in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 includes \xe2\x80\x9c[l]egal duties imposed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312,\n324 (2008)\n (holding that a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98requirements\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinclud[e] [the state\xe2\x80\x99s] common-law duties\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While \xe2\x80\x9crule[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstandard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d are not mentioned in the current version of the statute, this omission is the result of a recodification that was not meant to affect the provision\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Those additional terms were deleted as part of a wholesale recodification of Title 49 in 1994, but Congress made it clear that this recodification did not effect any \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive change.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa01(a),\n\n108Stat.\n745.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In arguing that common-law rules fall outside the scope of the ADA pre-emption provision, respondent relies on our decision in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,\n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 51 (2002)\n, which held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but there are critical differences between the pre-emption provisions in the Boat Safety Act and the ADA.  The Boat Safety Act provision applies only to \xe2\x80\x9ca law or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n46 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74306, whereas the ADA provision, as just explained, is much more broadly worded.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition, the relationship between the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision and the saving provision carried over from the prior law is also quite different.  The Sprietsma decision placed substantial weight on the Boat Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s saving provision, which was enacted at the same time as the pre-emption provision, but we have described the Federal Aviation Act saving clause as \xe2\x80\x9ca relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption regime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morales, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 385.  That provision applies to the entire, sprawling Federal Aviation Act, and not just to the ADA, and as we held in Morales, this \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral \xe2\x80\x98remedies\xe2\x80\x99 saving clause cannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  See also Wolens, supra, at 245 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  For these reasons, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ADA pre-emption provision cannot be squared with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s terms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the central purpose of the ADA.  The Act eliminated federal regulation of rates, routes, and services in order to allow those aspects of air transportation to be set by market forces, and the pre-emption provision was included to prevent the States from undoing what the Act was meant to accomplish.  Morales, supra, at 378.  What is important, therefore, is the effect of a state law, regulation, or provision, not its form, and the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s deregulatory aim can be undermined just as surely by a state common-law rule as it can by a state statute or regulation.  See Medtronic, Inc., supra, at 325 (recognizing that state tort law that imposes certain requirements would \xe2\x80\x9cdisrup[t] the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the First Circuit has recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t defies logic to think that Congress would disregard real-world consequences and give dispositive effect to the form of a clear intrusion into a federally regulated industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brown, 720 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 66\xe2\x80\x9367.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, if all state common-law rules fell outside the ambit of the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption provision, we would have had no need in Wolens to single out a subcategory of common-law claims, i.e., those based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary undertaking, as falling outside that provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother provision having the force and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d includes common-law claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We must next determine whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s breach of implied covenant claim \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crates, routes, or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  A claim satisfies this requirement if it has \xe2\x80\x9ca connection with, or reference to, airline\xe2\x80\x9d prices, routes, or services, Morales, supra, at 384, and the claim at issue here clearly has such a connection.  That claim seeks respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement in Northwest\xe2\x80\x99s frequent flyer program so that he can access the program\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvaluable . . . benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cflight upgrades, accumulated mileage, loyalty program status or benefits on other airlines, and other advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 49\xe2\x80\x9350.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Like the frequent flyer program in Wolens, the Northwest program is connected to the airline\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crates\xe2\x80\x9d because the program awards mileage credits that can be redeemed for tickets and upgrades.  See 513 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226.  When miles are used in this way, the rate that a customer pays, i.e., the price of a particular ticket, is either eliminated or reduced.  The program is also connected to \xe2\x80\x9cservices,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., access to flights and to higher service categories.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent argues that his claim differs from the claims in Wolens because he \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not challenge access to flights and upgrades or the number of miles needed to obtain air tickets\xe2\x80\x9d but instead contests \xe2\x80\x9cthe termination of his WorldPerks elite membership,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 12, but this argument ignores respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reason for seeking reinstatement of his membership, i.e., to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proffered distinction has no substance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent and amici suggest that Wolens is not controlling because frequent flyer programs have fundamentally changed since the time of that decision.  We are told that \xe2\x80\x9cmost miles [are now] earned without consuming airline services\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9cspent without consuming airline services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State of California et\xc2\xa0al. 18 (emphasis deleted).  But whether or not this alleged change might have some impact in a future case, it is not implicated here.  In this case, respondent did not assert that he earned his miles from any activity other than taking flights or that he attempted to redeem miles for anything other than tickets and upgrades.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With these preliminary issues behind us, we turn to the central issue in this case, i.e., whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s implied covenant claim is based on a state-imposed obligation or simply one that the parties voluntarily undertook.  Petitioners urge us to hold that implied covenant claims are always pre-empted, and respondent suggests that such claims are generally not pre-empted, but the reasoning of Wolens neither dooms nor spares all such claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While most States recognize some form of the good faith and fair dealing doctrine, it does not appear that there is any uniform understanding of the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s precise meaning.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he concept of good faith in the performance of contracts \xe2\x80\x98is a phrase without general meaning (or meanings) of its own.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Tymshare, Inc. v.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\xe2\x80\x9334; see also In\xc2\xa0re Hennepin Cty. 1986 Recycling Bond Litigation, 540 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 292, 502 (Minn. 1995); Sterling Capital Advisors, Inc. v.

And as a leading commentator has explained, a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunwillingness to allow people to disclaim the obligation of good faith .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shows that the obligation cannot be implied, but is law imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  3A A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \xc2\xa7654A, p. 88 (L. Cunningham &amp; A. Jacobsen eds. Supp. 1994).  When the law of a State does not authorize parties to free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under the reasoning of Wolens.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Another feature of Minnesota law provides an additional, independent basis for our conclusion.  Minnesota law holds that the implied covenant applies to \xe2\x80\x9cevery contract,\xe2\x80\x9d In re Hennepin Cty., supra, at 502, with the notable exception of employment contracts.  Hunt v. IBM Mid America Employees Fed. Credit Union, 384 N. W. 2d 853, 857\xe2\x80\x93858 (Minn. 1986).  The exception for employment contracts is based, in significant part, on \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d  id., at 858, and therefore the decision not to exempt other types of contracts must be based on a policy determination, namely, that the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy reasons\xe2\x80\x9d that support the rule for employment contracts do not apply (at least with the same force) in other contexts.  When the application of the implied covenant depends on state policy, a breachof implied covenant claim cannot be viewed as simply an attempt to vindicate the parties\xe2\x80\x99 implicit understanding of the contract.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For these reasons, the breach of implied covenant claim in this case cannot stand, but petitioners exhort us to go further and hold that all such claims, no matter the content of the law of the relevant jurisdiction, are pre-empted.  If pre-emption depends on state law, petitioners warn, airlines will be faced with a baffling patchwork of rules, and the deregulatory aim of the ADA will be frustrated.  But the airlines have means to avoid such a result.  A State\xe2\x80\x99s implied covenant rules will escape pre-emption only if the law of the relevant State permits an airline to contract around those rules in its frequent flyer program agreement, and if an airline\xe2\x80\x99s agreement is governed by the law of such a State, the airline can specify that the agreement does not incorporate the covenant.  While the inclusion of such a provision may impose transaction costs and presumably would not enhance the attractiveness of the program, an airline can decide whether the benefits of such a provision are worth the potential costs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our holding also does not leave participants in frequent flyer programs without protection.  The ADA is based on the view that the best interests of airline passengers are most effectively promoted, in the main, by allowing the free market to operate.  If an airline acquires a reputation for mistreating the participants in its frequent flyer program (who are generally the airline\xe2\x80\x99s most loyal and valuable customers), customers can avoid that program and may be able to enroll in a more favorable rival program.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Federal law also provides protection for frequent flyer program participants.  Congress has given the Department of Transportation (DOT) the general authority to prohibit and punish unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation and in the sale of air transportation,\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741712(a), and Congress has specifically authorized the DOT to investigate complaints relating to frequent flyer programs.  See FAA Modernization andReform Act of 2012, \xc2\xa7408(6),\n\n126Stat.\n87.  Pursuant to these provisions, the DOT regularly entertains and acts on such complaints.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We note, finally, that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim of ill treatment by Northwest might have been vindicated if he had pursued his breach-of-contract claim after its dismissal by the District Court.  Respondent argues that, contrary to the holding of the District Court, the frequent flyer agreement did not actually give Northwest unfettered discretion to terminate his membership in the program, see Brief for Respondent 20\xe2\x80\x9321, and the United States makes a related argument, namely, that even if the agreement gave Northwest complete discretion with respect to a determination regarding abuse of the program, the agreement did not necessarily bar a claim asserting that membership was ended for an ulterior reason, such as an effort to cut costs.  If respondent had appealed the dismissal of his breach-of-contract claim, he could have presented these arguments to the Court of Appeals, but he chose not to press that claim.
