Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution or federal statute.  Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in large measure from misty understandings of English legal history.  In view of lower federal-court decisions expansively interpreting the two exceptions, this Court reined in the domestic relations exception in <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html">504 U. S. 689</a>, and endeavored similarly to curtail the probate exception in <em>Markham</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/490/index.html">326 U. S. 490</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), a.k.a. Anna Nicole Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard Marshall II (J. Howard), who died without providing for Vickie in his will.  According to Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her through a gift in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9ccatch-all\xe2\x80\x9d trust.  Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce), J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s son, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s estate plan.  While the estate was subject to ongoing Texas Probate Court proceedings, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in California.  Pierce filed a proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy court, alleging that Vickie had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s death, her lawyers told the press that Pierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and overreaching to gain control of his father\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  Pierce sought a declaration that his claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Vickie answered, asserting truth as a defense.  She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected from J. Howard.  Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference counterclaim turned her objection to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim into an adversary proceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007, in which the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for Vickie on Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her counterclaim.  The court also held that both Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s objection to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim and her counterclaim qualified as \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a final judgment disposing of those claims.  It awarded Vickie substantial compensatory and punitive damages.  Pierce then filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate proceedings.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion.  Relying on <em>Markham,</em> the Bankruptcy Court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in probate property, so long as its final judgment does not interfere with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s possession of the property.  Subsequently, the Texas Probate Court declared that J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s estate plan was valid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Among other things, the District Court held that the probate exception did not reach Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim.  Citing <em>Markham</em>, 326 U. S., at 494, the court said that the exception would bar federal jurisdiction only if such jurisdiction would \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere\xe2\x80\x9d with the probate proceedings.  It would not do so, the court concluded, because: (1) success on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration that J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s will was invalid, and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim asserted.  The court also held that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedin[g]\xe2\x80\x9d over which a bankruptcy court may exercise plenary power, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).<em> </em>Accordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as proposed, rather than final, and undertook <em>de novo</em> review.  Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings, the District Court determined that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s expectancy by, <em>inter alia</em>, conspiring to suppress or destroy the <em>inter vivos</em> trust instrument J. Howard had directed his lawyers to prepare for Vickie, and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise falsifying documents and presenting them to J. Howard under false pretenses.  The District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory damages and, based on \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud, an equal amount in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Although the Court of Appeals recognized that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter, it nonetheless held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction in this case.  It read the exception broadly to exclude from the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 adjudicatory authority not only direct challenges to a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate planning instrument, whether those questions involve fraud, undue influence, or tortious interference with the testator\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  The court also held that a State\xe2\x80\x99s vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate matters in a special court strips federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain any probate related matter, including claims respecting tax liability, debt, gift, and tort.  Noting that the Probate Court had ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claims, the Ninth Circuit held that ruling binding on the Federal District Court.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit had no warrant from Congress, or from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, for its sweeping extension of the probate exception recognized in those decisions.  Because this case does not fall within the exception\xe2\x80\x99s scope, the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction over Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim against Pierce.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Ankenbrandt</em> addressed the domestic relations exception\xe2\x80\x99s derivation and limits.  Among other things, the Court<em>, </em>504 U. S., at 693\xe2\x80\x93695, traced the current exception to <em>Barber </em>v.<em> Barber</em>, 21 How. 582, 584\xe2\x80\x93589, in which the Court had announced in dicta\xe2\x80\x94without citation or discussion\xe2\x80\x94that federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for divorce or alimony.  Finding no Article III impediment to federal-court jurisdiction in domestic relations cases, 504 U. S., at 695\xe2\x80\x93697, the <em>Ankenbrandt</em> Court, <em>id.</em>, at 698\xe2\x80\x93701, anchored the exception in the Judiciary Act of 1789, which, until 1948, provided circuit court diversity jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9call suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The <em>Barber </em>majority, the <em>Ankenbrandt</em> Court acknowledged, 504 U. S., at 698, did not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute, but the <em>Barber</em> dissenters made the connection.  Because English chancery courts lacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees, the dissenters stated, United States courts similarly lacked authority to decree divorces or award alimony, 21 How., at 605.  The <em>Ankenbrandt</em> Court was \xe2\x80\x9ccontent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto rest [its] conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accuracy of [<em>Barber</em>\xe2\x80\x99s] historical justifications, but, \xe2\x80\x9crather,\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948,\xe2\x80\x9d 504 U. S., at 700.  <em>Ankenbrandt</em> further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the exception in 1948 when it \xe2\x80\x9creplace[d] the law/equity distinction with the phrase \xe2\x80\x98all civil actions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 700.  The <em>Ankenbrandt</em> Court nevertheless emphasized that the exception covers only \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow range of domestic relations issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 701.  Noting that some lower federal courts had applied the exception \xe2\x80\x9cwell beyond the circumscribed situations posed by <em>Barber </em>and its progeny,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the Court clarified that only \xe2\x80\x9cdivorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\xe2\x80\x9d remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, <em>id.</em>, at 703, 704.  While recognizing state tribunals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cspecial proficiency\xe2\x80\x9d in handling issues arising in the granting of such decrees, <em>id.</em>, at 704, the Court viewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging torts, <em>ibid.  </em>Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court has recognized a probate exception, kin to the domestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g., Markham,</em> the Court\xe2\x80\x99s most recent and pathmarking pronouncement on the subject.  Among other things, the <em>Markham</em> Court first stated that, although \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court has no jurisdiction to probate a will or administer an estate[,] it has [long] been established \xe2\x80\xa6 that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits \xe2\x80\x98in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs\xe2\x80\x99 and other claimants against a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate \xe2\x80\x98to establish their claims\xe2\x80\x99 so long as the federal court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.\xe2\x80\x9d 326 U. S., at 494.  The Court next described a probate exception of distinctly limited scope: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdiction to disturb or affect the possession of property in the custody of a state court, \xe2\x80\xa6 it may exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in such property where the final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s possession save to the extent that the state court is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The first of these quoted passages is not a model of clear statement, and some lower federal courts have read the words \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere with the probate proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate, including an executor\xe2\x80\x99s breach of fiduciary duty.  This Court reads <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe \xe2\x80\x9cdisturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Though that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, redundancy in this context is preferable to incoherence.  This Court therefore comprehends <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterference\xe2\x80\x9d language as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction over a <em>res</em>, a second court will not assume <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the same <em>res.</em>  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Penn General Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/294/189/index.html">294 U. S. 189</a>, 195\xe2\x80\x93196.  Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate; it also precludes federal courts from disposing of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.  But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.  Provoked by Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim alleges the widely recognized tort of interference with a gift or inheritance.  She seeks an<em> in personam </em>judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will.  Cf. <em>Sutton</em> v. <em>English,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/246/199/index.html">246 U. S. 199</a>, 208.  Nor does she seek to reach a <em>res </em>in a state court\xe2\x80\x99s custody.  See <em>Markham</em>, 326 U. S., at 494.  Furthermore, no \xe2\x80\x9csound policy considerations\xe2\x80\x9d militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover this case.  Cf.<font b="1"> <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, 504 U. S.,<em> </em>at 703.  Trial courts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges.  State probate courts possess no \xe2\x80\x9cspecial proficiency\xe2\x80\x9d in handling such issues.  Cf.<font b="1"> <em>id.</em>, at 704.<font b="1">  P.\xc2\xa015.  </font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0This Court rejects the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s alternate rationale that the Texas Probate Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional ruling bound the Federal District Court.  Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for interference with an expected gift or inheritance.  It is clear, under <em>Erie R.\xc2\xa0Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a>, that Texas law governs the substantive elements of Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claim.  But it is also clear that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to adjudicate a transitory tort.  See <em>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.\xc2\xa0Co. </em>v. <em>George</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/233/354/index.html">233 U. S. 354</a>, 360.  Jurisdiction is determined \xe2\x80\x9cby the law of the court\xe2\x80\x99s creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a [state] statute \xe2\x80\xa6 , even though it created the right of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Directly on point, the Court has held that federal-court jurisdiction, \xe2\x80\x9chaving existed from the beginning of the Federal government, [can] not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McClellan </em>v.<em> Carland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/index.html">217 U. S. 268</a>, 281.  <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Duke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/106/index.html">375 U. S. 106</a>, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, is not to the contrary.  <em>Durfee </em>stands only for the proposition that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s final judgment determining <em>its own</em> jurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 111, 115.  At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, but the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction to entertain Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claim.  Under our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that genre.

We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).  Among longstanding limitations on federal jurisdiction otherwise properly exercised are the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic relations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprobate\xe2\x80\x9d exceptions.  Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution or federal statute.  Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in large measure from misty understandings of English legal history.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Atwood, Domestic Relations Cases in Federal Court: Toward a Principled Exercise of Jurisdiction, 35 Hastings L.\xc2\xa0J. 571, 584\xe2\x80\x93588 (1984); <em>Spindel </em>v. <em>Spindel</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 797, 802 (EDNY 1968) (collecting cases and commentary revealing vulnerability of historical explanation for domestic relations exception); Winkler, The Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 14 Probate L.\xc2\xa0J. 77, 125\xe2\x80\x93126, and n. 256 (1997) (describing historical explanation for probate exception as \xe2\x80\x9can exercise in mythography\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the years following Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s 1821 pronouncement, courts have sometimes lost sight of his admonition and have rendered decisions expansively interpreting the two exceptions.  In <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html"></a><a href="/us/504/689/index.html">504 U.

Although he lavished gifts and significant sums of money on Vickie during their courtship and marriage, J. Howard did not include anything for Vickie in his will.  According to Vickie, J.

Pierce sought a declaration that the debt he asserted in that claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Vickie answered, asserting truth as a defense.  She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see App. 23\xe2\x80\x9325.  Vickie alleged that Pierce prevented the transfer of his father\xe2\x80\x99s intended gift to her by, among other things: effectively imprisoning J. Howard against his wishes; surrounding him with hired guards for the purpose of preventing personal contact between him and Vickie; making misrepresentations to J. Howard; and transferring property against J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s expressed wishes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 24.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference counterclaim turned her objection to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim into an adversary proceeding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 39; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007.  In that proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of Vickie on Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her tortious interference counterclaim.  See 253 B.\xc2\xa0R. 550, 558\xe2\x80\x93559 (2000).  The Bankruptcy Court also held that both Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s objection to Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim and Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim qualified as \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a final judgment disposing of those claims.  See 257 B.\xc2\xa0R. 35, 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (2000).  The court awarded Vickie compensatory damages of more than $449 million\xe2\x80\x94less whatever she recovered in the ongoing probate action in Texas\xe2\x80\x94as well as $25 million in punitive damages.  <em>Id.</em>, at 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pierce filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s tortious interference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate proceedings.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The Bankruptcy Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98probate exception\xe2\x80\x99 argument was waived\xe2\x80\x9d because it was not timely raised.  <em>Id.</em>, at 39.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Markham</em>,<em> </em>the court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicate rights in probate property, so long as its final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s possession of the property.\xe2\x80\x9d  257 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 38 (citing <em>Markham</em>, 326 U. S., at 494).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, in the Texas Probate Court, Pierce sought a declaration that the living trust and his father\xe2\x80\x99s will were valid.  392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1124\xe2\x80\x931125.  Vickie, in turn, challenged the validity of the will and filed a tortious interference claim against Pierce, <em>ibid.</em>, but voluntarily dismissed both claims once the Bankruptcy Court entered its judgment, <em>id.</em>, at 1128.  Following a jury trial, the Probate Court declared the living trust and J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s will valid.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1129.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  While rejecting the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Pierce had forfeited any argument based on the probate exception, the District Court held that the exception did not reach Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  264 B.\xc2\xa0R. 609, 619\xe2\x80\x93625 (CD Cal. 2001).  The Bankruptcy Court \xe2\x80\x9cdid not assert jurisdiction generally over the probate proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 or take control over [the] estate\xe2\x80\x99s assets,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court observed, <em>id.</em>, at 621, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hus, the probate exception would bar federal jurisdiction over Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim only if such jurisdiction would \xe2\x80\x98interfere\xe2\x80\x99 with the probate proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Markham</em>, 326 U. S., at 494).<em> </em>Federal jurisdiction would not \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere\xe2\x80\x9d with the probate proceedings, the District Court concluded, because: (1) success on Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration that J. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s will was invalid, 264 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 621; and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind asserted in Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim, <em>id.</em>, at 622\xe2\x80\x93625.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court also held that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedin[g] arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157(b)(1); see 264 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 625\xe2\x80\x93632.  A bankruptcy court may exercise plenary power only over \xe2\x80\x9ccore proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7157(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]<em> </em>In non-core matters, a bankruptcy court may not enter final judgment; it has authority to issue only proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are reviewed <em>de novo </em>by the district court.  See \xc2\xa7157(c)(1).  Accordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as \xe2\x80\x9cproposed[,] rather than final,\xe2\x80\x9d and undertook a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive, complete, and independent review of\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s determinations.  264 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 633.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings, the District Court determined that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s expectancy.  Specifically, the District Court found that J. Howard directed his lawyers to prepare an <em>inter vivos</em> trust for Vickie consisting of half the appreciation of his assets from the date of their marriage.  See 275 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 25\xe2\x80\x9330, 51\xe2\x80\x9353.  It further found that Pierce conspired to suppress or destroy the trust instrument and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise falsifying documents, arranging for surveillance of J. Howard and Vickie, and presenting documents to J. Howard under false pretenses.  See <em>id.</em>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9350, 57\xe2\x80\x9358; see also 253 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 554\xe2\x80\x93556, 559\xe2\x80\x93560.  Based on these findings, the District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory damages.  275 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 53\xe2\x80\x9357.  In addition, finding \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwillfulness, maliciousness, and fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court awarded an equal amount in punitive damages.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57\xe2\x80\x9358.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The appeals court recognized that Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1133.  Nevertheless, the court held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction in this case.  In the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, a claim falls within the probate exception if it raises \xe2\x80\x9cquestions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate planning instrument,\xe2\x80\x9d whether those questions involve \xe2\x80\x9cfraud, undue influence[, or] tortious interference with the testator\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit was also of the view that state-court delineation of a probate court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive adjudicatory authority could control federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  In this regard, the Court of Appeals stated: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere a state has relegated jurisdiction over probate matters to a special court and [the] state\xe2\x80\x99s trial courts of general jurisdiction do not have jurisdiction to hear probate matters, then federal courts also lack jurisdiction over probate matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1136.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [P]robate [C]ourt ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie[\xe2\x80\x99s] claims,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ninth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9cruling \xe2\x80\xa6 binding on the United States [D]istrict [C]ourt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Duke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/375/106/index.html">375 U.

Carol Ankenbrandt, a citizen of Missouri, brought suit in Federal District Court on behalf of her daughters, naming as defendants their father (Ankenbrandt\xe2\x80\x99s former husband) and his female companion, both citizens of Louisiana.  <em>Id.</em>, at 691.  Ankenbrandt\xe2\x80\x99s complaint sought damages for the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 alleged sexual and physical abuse of the children.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Federal jurisdiction was predicated on diversity of citizenship.  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing 28 U.

See <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, 504 U. S., at 693\xe2\x80\x93695.  In <em>Barber</em>, the Court upheld federal-court authority, in a diversity case, to enforce an alimony award decreed by a state court.  In dicta, however, the <em>Barber </em>Court announced\xe2\x80\x94without citation or discussion\xe2\x80\x94that federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony.  21 How., at 584\xe2\x80\x93589; see <em>Ankenbrandt</em>,<em> </em>504 U.

Beginning at the beginning, the Court recalled:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that \xe2\x80\x98the circuit courts shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of <em>all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds</em>, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of <em>five hundred dollars</em>, and \xe2\x80\xa6 an alien is a party, or the suit is <em>between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State</em>.\xe2\x80\x99   \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 698 (quoting Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \xc2\xa711, 1 Stat. 78; emphasis added in <em>Ankenbrandt</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe defining phrase, \xe2\x80\x9call suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stressed, remained in successive statutory provisions for diversity jurisdiction until 1948, when Congress adopted the more economical phrase, \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 698; 1948 Judicial Code and Judiciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Barber </em>majority, we acknowledged in <em>Ankenbrandt</em>, did not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute.  504 U. S., at 698.  But the dissenters in that case made the connection.  <em> </em>They stated that English courts of chancery lacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in chancery is bounded by that of the chancery in England,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barber</em>, 21 How., at 605 (opinion of Daniel, J.), the dissenters reasoned, our federal courts similarly lack authority to decree divorces or award alimony, <em>ibid.  </em>Such relief, in other words, would not fall within the diversity statute\xe2\x80\x99s original grant of jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9call suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\xe2\x80\x9d  We concluded in <em>Ankenbrandt</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cit may be inferred fairly that the jurisdictional limitation recognized by the <em>[Barber]</em> Court rested on th[e] statutory basis\xe2\x80\x9d indicated by the dissenters in that case.  504 U. S., at 699.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We were \xe2\x80\x9ccontent\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Ankenbrandt </em>\xe2\x80\x9cto rest our conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accuracy of the historical justifications on which [the exception] was seemingly based.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 700.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]ather,\xe2\x80\x9d we relied on \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948, when the statute limited jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x98suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting 1 Stat. 78).  We further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the exception in 1948 when it \xe2\x80\x9creplace[d] the law/equity distinction with the phrase \xe2\x80\x98all civil actions.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 700.  Absent contrary indications, we presumed that Congress meant to leave undisturbed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court\xe2\x80\x99s nearly century-long interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the diversity statute \xe2\x80\x9cto contain an exception for certain domestic relations matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We nevertheless emphasized in <em>Ankenbrandt </em>that the exception covers only \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow range of domestic relations issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 701.  The <em>Barber </em>Court itself, we reminded, \xe2\x80\x9csanctioned the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the enforcement of an alimony decree that had been properly obtained in a state court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S., at 702.  Noting that some lower federal courts had applied the domestic relations exception \xe2\x80\x9cwell beyond the circumscribed situations posed by <em>Barber </em>and its progeny,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 701, we clarified that only \xe2\x80\x9cdivorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\xe2\x80\x9d remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, <em>id.</em>, at 703, 704.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial proficiency developed by state tribunals \xe2\x80\xa6 in handling issues that arise in the granting of [divorce, alimony, and child custody] decrees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 704, we viewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging the commission of torts, <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal jurisdiction in this case is premised on 28 U.

S., at 491\xe2\x80\x93492.  Jurisdiction was predicated on \xc2\xa724(1) of the Judicial Code, now 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71345, which provides for federal jurisdiction over suits brought by an officer of the United States.  At the time the federal suit commenced, the estate was undergoing probate administration in a state court.  The Custodian had issued an order vesting in himself all right, title, and interest of German legatees.  He sought and gained in the District Court a judgment determining that the resident heirs had no interest in the estate, and that the Custodian, substituting himself for the German legatees, was entitled to the entire net estate, including specified real estate passing under the will.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reversing the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered the case dismissed for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, this Court held that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked.  The Court first stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that a federal court has no jurisdiction to probate a will or administer an estate \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  But it has been established by a long series of decisions of this Court that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits \xe2\x80\x98in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs\xe2\x80\x99 and other claimants against a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate \xe2\x80\x98to establish their claims\xe2\x80\x99 so long as the federal court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U. S., at 494 (quoting <em>Waterman</em>, 215 U.

The Court observed that federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain suits to determine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other claimants against a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the federal court does not <em>interfere with the probate proceedings</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  Lower federal courts have puzzled over the meaning of the words \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere with the probate proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d and some have read those words to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate.

Golden </em>v. <em>Golden</em>, 382 F.\xc2\xa03d 348, 360\xe2\x80\x93362 (CA3 2004) (same); <em>Lepard</em> v.<em> NBD Bank</em>, 384 F.\xc2\xa03d 232\xe2\x80\x93237 (CA6 2004) (breach of fiduciary duty by trustee); <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Storm</em>, 328 F.\xc2\xa03d 941, 943\xe2\x80\x93945 (CA7 2003) (probate exception bars claim that plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s father tortiously interfered with plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance by persuading trust grantor to amend irrevocable <em>inter vivos</em> trust); <em>Rienhardt </em>v. <em>Kelly</em>, 164 F.\xc2\xa03d 1296, 1300\xe2\x80\x931301 (CA10 1999) (probate exception bars claim that defendants exerted undue influence on testator and thereby tortiously interfered with plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s expected inheritance).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We read <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe \xe2\x80\x9cdisturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  326 U. S., at 494.  True, that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, but redundancy in this context, we do not doubt, is preferable to incoherence.  In short, we comprehend the \xe2\x80\x9cinterference\xe2\x80\x9d language in <em>Markham </em>as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction over a <em>res</em>, a second court will not assume <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the same <em>res.</em>  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Penn General Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/294/189/index.html">294 U. S. 189</a>, 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (1935); <em>Waterman</em>, 215 U. S., at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate; it also precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.  But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1133.  Provoked by Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie\xe2\x80\x99s claim, like Carol Ankenbrandt\xe2\x80\x99s, alleges a widely recognized tort.  See <em>King </em>v. <em>Acker</em>, 725 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 750, 754 (Tex.

Vickie seeks an<em> in personam </em>judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will.  Cf. <em>Sutton</em>, 246 U. S., at 208 (suit to annul a will found \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental to the proceedings for probate of the will\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore not cognizable in federal court).

Occasionally, however, disputes between interested parties arise, either in the probate proceeding itself or elsewhere, that qualify as cases or controversies that federal courts have jurisdiction to decide.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Reed</em> v. <em>Reed,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/71/index.html">404 U. S. 71</a> (1971).  In her opinion for the Court, Justice Ginsburg has cogently explained why this is such a case.  I write separately to explain why I do not believe there is any \xe2\x80\x9cprobate exception\xe2\x80\x9d that ousts a federal court of jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The familiar aphorism that hard cases make bad law should extend to easy cases as well.  <em>Markham</em> v. <em>Allen,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/490/index.html">326 U. S. 490</a> (1946), like this case, was an easy case.  In <em>Markham</em>, as here, it was unnecessary to question the historical or logical underpinnings of the probate exception to federal jurisdiction because, whatever the scope of the supposed exception, it did not extend to the case at hand.  But <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s obiter dicta\xe2\x80\x94dicta that the Court now describes as redundant if not incoherent, <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x94generated both confusion and abdication of the obligation Chief Justice Marshall so famously articulated, see <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia,</em> 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821); see also <em>ante</em>, at 1.  While the Court today rightly abandons much of that dicta<em>,</em> I would go further.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is content to adopt the approach it followed in <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/689/index.html">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992), and to accept as foundation for the probate exception <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s bald assertion that the English High Court of Chancery\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction did not \xe2\x80\x9cextend to probate matters\xe2\x80\x9d in 1789.  326 U. S., at 495; see <em>ante</em>, at 11.  I would not accept that premise.  Not only had the theory <em>Markham</em> espoused been only sporadically and tentatively cited as justification for the exception,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] but the most comprehensive article on the subject has persuasively demonstrated that <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is \xe2\x80\x9can exercise in mythography.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s theory apparently is the source of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reformulated exception, which \xe2\x80\x9creserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Although undoubtedly narrower in scope than <em>Markham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s ill-considered description of the probate carve-out, this description also sweeps too broadly.  For the Court has correctly upheld the exercise of federal jurisdiction over actions involving the annulment of wills and the administration of decedents\xe2\x80\x99 estates.  In <em>Gaines</em> v. <em>Fuentes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/10/index.html"></a><a href="/us/92/10/index.html">92 U. S. 10</a> (1876), for example, the Court held that a defendant in an action to annul a will should be permitted to remove the case to federal court.  In so doing, it explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]henever a controversy in a suit \xe2\x80\xa6 arises respecting the validity or construction of a will, or the enforcement of a decree admitting it to probate, there is no more reason why the Federal courts should not take jurisdiction of the case than there is that they should not take jurisdiction of any other controversy between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 22.</p>\n<p align="left">\nLikewise, in <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Hook,</em> 7 Wall. 425 (1869), the Court explained that it was \xe2\x80\x9cwell settled that a court of chancery, as an incident to its power to enforce trusts, and make those holding a fiduciary relation account, has jurisdiction to compel executors and administrators to account and distribute the assets in their hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 431.  (In that same case, a federal court later appointed a Special Master to administer the estate.  This Court upheld some of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s determinations and rejected others.  See <em>Hook</em> v. <em>Payne,</em> 14 Wall. 252, 255 (1872).)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, there are cases that support limitations on federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over the probate and annulment of wills and the administration of decedents\xe2\x80\x99 estates.  But careful examination reveals that at least most of the limitations so recognized stem not from some <em>sui generis</em> exception, but rather from generally applicable jurisdictional rules.  Cf. <em>Ellis</em> v. <em>Davis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/109/485/index.html">109 U. S. 485</a>, 497 (1883) (\xe2\x80\x9cJurisdiction as to wills, and their probate as such, is neither included in nor excepted out of the grant of judicial power to the courts of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Some of those rules, like the rule that diversity jurisdiction will not attach absent an <em>inter partes</em> controversy, plainly are still relevant today.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Waterman</em> v. <em>Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/215/33/index.html">215 U.

Others, like the rule that a bill in equity will lie only where there is no adequate remedy elsewhere, have less straightforward application in the wake of 20th-century jurisdictional developments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Case of Broderick\xe2\x80\x99s Will,</em> 21 Wall. 503, 510\xe2\x80\x93512 (1875); <em>Ellis</em>, 109 U.

Whatever the continuing viability of these individual rules, together they are more than adequate to the task of cabining federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction.  They require no helping hand from the so-called probate exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than preserving whatever vitality that the \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d has retained as a result of the <em>Markham</em> dicta, I would provide the creature with a decent burial in a grave adjacent to the resting place of the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine.
