Both the chief of police and Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor had been appointed by Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent mayor, who was running for re-election against Lawrence Spagnola, a good friend of Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s.  Heffernan was not involved in Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in any capacity.  As a favor to his bedridden mother, Heffernan agreed to pick up and deliver to her a Spagnola campaign yard sign.  Other police officers observed Heffernan speaking to staff at a Spagnola distribution point while holding the yard sign.  Word quickly spread throughout the force.  The next day, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors demoted him from detective to patrol officer as punishment for his \xe2\x80\x9covert involvement\xe2\x80\x9d in Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.  Heffernan filed suit, claiming that the police chief and the other respondents had demoted him because, in their mistaken view, he had engaged in conduct that constituted protected speech.  They had thereby \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d him of a \xe2\x80\x9cright\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. secured by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  The District Court, however, found that Heffernan had not been deprived of any constitutionally protected right because he had not engaged in any\n \nFirst Amendment conduct.  Affirming, the Third Circuit concluded that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s claim was actionable under \xc2\xa71983 only if his employer\xe2\x80\x99s action was prompted by Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s actual, rather than his perceived, exercise of his free-speech rights.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0When an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in protected political activity, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the\n \nFirst Amendment and \xc2\xa71983 even if, as here, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions are based on a factual mistake about the employee\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.  To answer the question whether an official\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake makes a critical legal difference, the Court assumes that the activities that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors mistakenly <i>thought</i> he had engaged in are of a kind that they cannot constitutionally prohibit or punish.  Section 1983 does not say whether the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d protected primarily focuses on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s actual activity or on the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s motive.  Neither does precedent directly answer the question.  In <i>Connick</i> v. <i>Myers</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138\n, <i>Garcetti</i> v. <i>Ceballos</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410\n, and <i>Pickering</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.</i>,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563\n, there were no factual mistakes: The only question was whether the undisputed reason for the adverse action was in fact protected by the\n \nFirst Amendment.  However, in <i>Waters</i> v. <i>Churchill</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661\n, a government employer\xe2\x80\x99s adverse action was based on a mistaken belief that an employee <i>had not</i> engaged in protected speech.  There, this Court determined that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motive, and particularly the facts as the employer reasonably understood them, mattered in determining that the employer had not violated the\n \nFirst Amendment.  The government\xe2\x80\x99s motive likewise matters here, where respondents demoted Heffernan on the mistaken belief that he <i>had </i>engaged in protected speech.  A rule of law finding liability in these circumstances tracks the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s language, which focuses upon the Government\xe2\x80\x99s activity.  Moreover, the constitutional harm\xe2\x80\x94discouraging employees from engaging in protected speech or association\xe2\x80\x94is the same whether or not the employer\xe2\x80\x99s action rests upon a factual mistake.  Finally, a rule of law imposing liability despite the employer\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake is not likely to impose significant extra costs upon the employer, for the employee bears the burden of proving an improper employer motive.

However, the lower courts should decide in the first instance whether respondents may have acted under a neutral policy prohibiting police officers from overt involvement in any political campaign and whether such a policy, if it exists, complies with constitutional standards.

See <i>Elrod</i> v. <i>Burns</i>,\n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1976)\n; <i>Branti</i> v. <i>Finkel</i>,\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507 (1980)\n; but cf. <i>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Letter Carriers</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 548,\n564 (1973)\n.  In this case a government official demoted an employee because the official believed, but <i>incorrectly</i> believed, that the employee had supported a particular candidate for mayor.  The question is whether the official\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake makes a critical legal difference.  Even though the employee had not in fact engaged in protected political activity, did his demotion \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive\xe2\x80\x9d him of a \xe2\x80\x9cright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. secured by the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  We hold that it did.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To decide the legal question presented, we assume the following, somewhat simplified, version of the facts: In 2005, Jeffrey Heffernan, the petitioner, was a police officer in Paterson, New Jersey.  He worked in the office of the Chief of Police, James Wittig.  At that time, the mayor of Paterson, Jose Torres, was running for reelection against Lawrence Spagnola.  Torres had appointed to their current positions both Chief Wittig and a subordinate who directly supervised Heffernan.  Heffernan was a good friend of Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">During the campaign, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who was bedridden, asked Heffernan to drive downtown and pick up a large Spagnola sign.  She wanted to replace a smaller Spagnola sign, which had been stolen from her front yard. Heffernan went to a Spagnola distribution point and picked up the sign.  While there, he spoke for a time to Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager and staff.  Other members of the police force saw him, sign in hand, talking to campaign workers.  Word quickly spread throughout the force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next day, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors demoted Heffernan from detective to patrol officer and assigned him to a \xe2\x80\x9cwalking post.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this way they punished Heffernan for what they thought was his \xe2\x80\x9covert involvement\xe2\x80\x9d in Spag-nola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.  In fact, Heffernan was not involved in the campaign but had picked up the sign simply to help his mother.  Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors had made a factual mistake.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Heffernan subsequently filed this lawsuit in federal court.  He claimed that Chief Wittig and the other respondents had demoted him because he had engaged in conduct that (on their mistaken view of the facts) constituted protected speech.  They had thereby \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d him of a \xe2\x80\x9cright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. secured by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court found that Heffernan had not engaged in any \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFirst Amendment conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 563, 580 (NJ 2014); and, for that reason, the respondents had not deprived him of any constitutionally protected right.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  It wrote that \xe2\x80\x9ca free-speech retaliation claim is actionable under \xc2\xa71983 only where the adverse action at issue was prompted by an employee\xe2\x80\x99s <i>actual</i>, rather than <i>perceived</i>, exercise of constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  777 F.\xc2\xa03d 147, 153 (2015) (citing <i>Ambrose</i> v. <i>Robinson</i>, 303 F.\xc2\xa03d 488, 496 (CA3 2002); emphasis added).  Heffernan filed a petition for certiorari.  We agreed to decide whether the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s legal view was correct.  Compare 777 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 153 (case below), with <i>Dye</i> v. <i>Office of Racing Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 702 F.\xc2\xa03d 286, 300 (CA6 2012) (similar factual mistake does not affect the validity of the government employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With a few exceptions, the Constitution prohibits a government employer from discharging or demoting an employee because the employee supports a particular political candidate.  See <i>Elrod</i> v. <i>Burns</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Branti</i> v. <i>Finkel</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The basic constitutional requirement reflects the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s hostility to government action that \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe[s] what shall be orthodox in politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed</i>. v. <i>Barnette</i>,\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,\n642 (1943)\n.  The exceptions take account of \xe2\x80\x9cpractical realities\xe2\x80\x9d such as the need for \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d in government service.  <i>Waters</i> v. <i>Churchill</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661,\n672,\n675 (1994)\n; see also <i>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 564 (neutral and appropriately limited policy may prohibit government employees from engaging in partisan activity), and <i>Branti</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 518 (political affiliation requirement permissible where affiliation is \xe2\x80\x9can appropriate requirement for effective performance of the public office involved\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In order to answer the question presented, we assume that the exceptions do not apply here.  But see <i>infra</i>, at 8<i>.  </i>We assume that the activities that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors <i>thought</i> he had engaged in are of a kind that they cannot constitutionally prohibit or punish, see <i>Rutan</i> v. <i>Republican Party of Ill.</i>,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 62,\n69 (1990)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cjoining, working for or contributing to the political party and candidates of their own choice\xe2\x80\x9d), but that the supervisors were mistaken about the facts.  Heffernan had not engaged in those protected activities.  Does Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional case consequently fail?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the relevant statute does not answer the question.  The statute authorizes a lawsuit by a person \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. secured by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  But in this context, what precisely is that \xe2\x80\x9cright?\xe2\x80\x9d  Is it a right that primarily focuses upon (the employee\xe2\x80\x99s) actual activity or a right that primarily fo-cuses upon (the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s) motive, insofar as that motive turns on<i> </i>what the supervisor believes that activity to be?  The text does not say.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither does precedent directly answer the question.  In some cases we have used language that suggests the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d at issue concerns the employee\xe2\x80\x99s actual activity.  In <i>Connick</i> v. <i>Myers</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138 (1983)\n, for example, we said that a court should first determine whether the plaintiff spoke \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as a citizen\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98matter[] of public concern,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 143.  We added that, if the employee has not engaged in what can \xe2\x80\x9cbe fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 146.  We made somewhat similar statements in <i>Garcetti</i> v. <i>Ceballos</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410,\n418 (2006)\n, and <i>Pickering</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.</i>,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563 (1968)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These cases, however, did not present the kind of question at issue here.  In <i>Connick</i>, for example, no factual mistake was at issue.  The Court assumed that both the employer and the employee were at every stage in agreement about the underlying facts: that the employer dismissed the employee because of her having circulated within the office a document that criticized how the office was being run (that she had in fact circulated).  The question was whether the circulation of that document amounted to constitutionally protected speech.  If not, the Court need go no further.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither was any factual mistake at issue in <i>Pickering.  </i>The Court assumed that both the employer (a school board) and the employee understood the cause for dismissal, namely, a petition that the employee had indeed circulated criticizing his employer\xe2\x80\x99s practices.  The question concerned whether the petition was protectedspeech.  <i>Garcetti </i>is substantially similar.  In each of these cases, the only way to show that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motive was unconstitutional was to prove that the controver-sial statement or activity\xe2\x80\x94in each case the undisputed reason for the firing\xe2\x80\x94was in fact protected by the\n \nFirst Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Waters</i> v. <i>Churchill</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661 (1994)\n, is more to the point.  In that case the Court did consider the consequences of an employer mistake.  The employer wrongly, though reasonably, believed that the employee had spoken only on personal matters not of public concern, and the employer dismissed the employee for having engaged in that unprotected speech.  The employee, however, had in fact used words that did not amount to personal \xe2\x80\x9cgossip\xe2\x80\x9d (as the employer believed) but which focused on matters of public concern.  The Court asked whether, and how, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake mattered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court held that, as long as the employer (1) had reasonably believed that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s conversation had involved personal matters, not matters of public concern, and (2) had dismissed the employee because of that mistaken belief, the dismissal did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.  <i>Id.,</i> at 679\xe2\x80\x93680.  In a word, it was the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motive, and in particular the facts as the employer reasonably understood them, that mattered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Waters</i>, the employer reasonably but mistakenly thought that the employee <i>had not</i> engaged in protected speech.  Here the employer mistakenly thought that the employee <i>had </i>engaged in protected speech.  If the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motive (and in particular the facts as the employer reasonably understood them) is what mattered in <i>Waters, </i>why is the same not true here?  After all, in the law, what is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We conclude that, as in <i>Waters</i>, the government\xe2\x80\x99s reason for demoting Heffernan is what counts here.  When an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the\n \nFirst Amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the\n \nFirst Amendment and\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x94even if, as here, the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We note that a rule of law finding liability in these circumstances tracks the language of the First Amend-ment more closely than would a contrary rule.  Unlike, say, the\n \nFourth Amendment, which begins by speaking of the \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ,\xe2\x80\x9d the\n \nFirst Amendment beginsby focusing upon the activity of the Government.  It says that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. abridging the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government acted upon a constitutionally harmful policy whether Heffernan did or did not in fact engage in political activity.  That which stands for a \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cCongress,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the police department\xe2\x80\x99s reason for taking action, \xe2\x80\x9cabridge[s] the freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d of employees aware of the policy.  And Heffernan was di-rectly harmed, namely, demoted, through application of that policy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We also consider relevant the constitutional implications of a rule that imposes liability.  The constitutional harm at issue in the ordinary case consists in large part of discouraging employees\xe2\x80\x94both the employee discharged (or demoted) and his or her colleagues\xe2\x80\x94from engaging in protected activities.  The discharge of one tells the others that they engage in protected activity at their peril.  See, <i>e.g</i>., <i>Elrod</i>, 427 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 359 (retaliatory employment action against one employee \xe2\x80\x9cunquestionably inhibits protected belief and association\xe2\x80\x9d of all employees).  Hence, we do not require plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to \xe2\x80\x9cprove that they, or other employees, have been coerced into changing, either actually or ostensibly, their political allegiance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Branti</i>, 445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517.  The employer\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake does not diminish the risk of causing precisely that same harm.  Neither, for that matter, is that harm diminished where an employer announces a policy of demoting those who, say, help a particular candidate in the mayoral race, and all employees (including Heffernan), fearful of demotion, refrain from providing any such help.  Cf.<i> Gooding </i>v. <i>Wilson</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518,\n521 (1972)\n (explaining that overbreadth doctrine is necessary \xe2\x80\x9cbecause persons whose expression is constitutionally protected may well refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d).  The upshot is that a discharge or demotion based upon an employer\xe2\x80\x99s belief that the employee has engaged in protected activity can cause the same kind, and degree, of constitutional harm whether that belief does or does not rest upon a factual mistake.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, we note that, contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 asser-tions, a rule of law that imposes liability despite the employer\xe2\x80\x99s factual mistake will not normally impose significant extra costs upon the employer.  To win, the employee must prove an improper employer motive.  In a case like this one, the employee will, if anything, find it more difficult to prove that motive, for the employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer\xe2\x80\x99s intent to discharge or to demote him for engaging in what the employer (mistakenly) believes to have been different (and protected) activities.  We concede that, for that very reason, it may be more complicated and costly for the employee to prove his case.  But an employee bringing suit will ordinarily shoulder that more complicated burden voluntarily in order to recover the damages he seeks.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now relax an assumption underlying our decision.  We have assumed that the policy that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s employers implemented violated the Constitution.  <i>Supra,</i> at 3.  There is some evidence in the record, however, suggesting that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s employers may have dismissed him pursuant to a different and neutral policy prohibiting police officers from overt involvement in any political campaign.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  Whether that policy existed, whether Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors were indeed following it, and whether it complies with constitutional standards, see <i>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>, 413 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 564, are all matters for the lower courts to decide in the first instance.

Because federal law does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs whose constitutional rights have not been violated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This lawsuit concerns a decision by the city of Paterson, New Jersey (hereinafter City), to demote one of its police officers, Jeffrey Heffernan.  At the time of Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s demotion, Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Jose Torres, was running for reelection against one of Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s friends, Lawrence Spagnola.  The police chief demoted Heffernan after another officer assigned to Mayor Torres\xe2\x80\x99 security detail witnessed Heffernan pick up a Spagnola campaign sign when Heffernan was off duty.  Heffernan claimed that he picked up the sign solely as an errand for his bedridden mother.  Heffernan denied supporting or associating with Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and disclaimed any intent to communicate support for Spagnola by retrieving the campaign sign.  Despite Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that he was not engaged in protected\n \nFirst Amendment activity, he filed this lawsuit alleging that his employer violated his\n \nFirst Amendment rights by demoting him based on its mistaken belief that Heffernan had communicated support for the Spagnola campaign.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Title\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 provides a cause of action against \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. subjects .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. any citizen of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  For Heffernan to prevail on his \xc2\xa71983 claim, then, a state actor must have deprived him of a constitutional right.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa71983 provides a remedy against public officials who attempt but fail to violate someone\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There are two ways to frame Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment claim, but neither can sustain his suit.  As in most \xc2\xa71983 suits, his claim could be that the City interfered with his freedom to speak and assemble.  But because Heffernan has conceded that he was not engaged in protected speech or assembly when he picked up the sign, the majority must resort to a second, more novel framing.  It concludes that Heffernan states a \xc2\xa71983 claim because the City unconstitutionally regulated employees\xe2\x80\x99 political speech and Heffernan was injured because that policy resulted in his demotion.  See <i>ante,</i> at 6.  Under that theory, too, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71983 claim fails.  A city\xe2\x80\x99s policy, even if unconstitutional, cannot be the basis of a \xc2\xa71983 suit when that policy does not result in the infringement of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To state a claim for retaliation in violation of the\n \nFirst Amendment, public employees like Heffernan must allege that their employer interfered with their right to speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  Whether the employee engaged in such speech is the threshold inquiry under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents governing whether a public employer violated the\n \nFirst Amendment rights of its employees.  See <i>Garcetti</i> v. <i>Ceballos</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410,\n418 (2006)\n.  If the employee has not spoken on a matter of public concern, \xe2\x80\x9cthe employee has no\n \nFirst Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i> If the employee did, however, speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern, then the Court looks to \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under this framework, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s claim fails at the first step.  He has denied that, by picking up the yard sign, he \xe2\x80\x9cspoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In fact, Heffernan denies speaking in support of or associating with the Spagnola campaign.  He has claimed that he picked up the yard sign only as an errand for hisbedridden mother.  Demoting a dutiful son who aids his elderly, bedridden mother may be callous, but it is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, Heffernan could exercise his\n \nFirst Amendment rights by choosing <i>not</i> to assemble with the Spagnola campaign.  Cf. <i>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nation Enterprises</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 539,\n559 (1985)\n (freedom of expression \xe2\x80\x9cincludes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But such an allegation could not save his claim here.  A retaliation claim requires proving that Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s protected activity was a cause-in-fact of the retaliation.  See <i>University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center</i> v. <i>Nassar</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 23).  And Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of his right not to associate with the Spagnola campaign did not cause his demotion.  Rather, his <i>perceived </i>association with the Spagnola campaign did.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At bottom, Heffernan claims that the City tried to interfere with his constitutional rights and failed.  But it is not enough for the City to have attempted to infringe his\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  To prevail on his claim, he must establish that the City <i>actually </i>did so.  The City\xe2\x80\x99s attempt never ripened into an actual violation of Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights because, unbeknownst to the City, Heffernan did not support Spagnola\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Though, in criminal law, a factually impossible attempt like the City\xe2\x80\x99s actions here could constitute an attempt,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]* there is no such doctrine in tort law.  A plaintiff may maintain a suit only for a completed tort; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are no attempted torts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Stefonek</i>, 179 F.\xc2\xa03d 1030, 1036 (CA7 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Sebok, Deterrence or Disgorgement? Reading <i>Ciraolo</i> After <i>Campbell</i>, 64 Md. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 541, 565 (2005) (same).  And \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no doubt that claims brought pursuant to \xc2\xa71983 sound in tort.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Monterey</i> v. <i>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.</i>,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 687,\n709 (1999)\n.  Because Heffernan could claim at most that the City attempted to interfere with his\n \nFirst Amendment rights, he cannot prevail on a claim under the theory that the City infringed his right to speak freely or assemble.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To get around this problem of factual impossibility, the majority reframes Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s case as one about the City\xe2\x80\x99s lack of power to act with unconstitutional motives.  See <i>ante,</i> at 4.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits the City from taking an adverse employment action intended to impede an employee\xe2\x80\x99s rights to speak and assemble, regardless of whether the City has accurately perceived an employee\xe2\x80\x99s political affiliation.  The majority surmises that an attempted violation of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment rights can be just as harmful as a successful deprivation of\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  And the majority concludes that the City\xe2\x80\x99s demotion of Heffernan based on his wrongfully perceived association with a political campaign is no differentfrom the City\xe2\x80\x99s demotion of Heffernan based on his actual association with a political campaign.  <i>Ante</i>, at 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But \xc2\xa71983 does not provide a cause of action for unauthorized government acts that do not infringe the constitutional rights of the \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff.  See <i>Blessing </i>v. <i>Freestone</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 329,\n340 (1997)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to seek redress through \xc2\xa71983, . . . a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal <i>right</i>, not merely a violation of federal <i>law</i>\xe2\x80\x9d).  Of course the\n \nFirst Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cfocus[es] upon the activity of the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 6.  See Amdt. 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  And here, the \xe2\x80\x9cactivity of Government\xe2\x80\x9d has caused Heffernan harm, namely, a demotion.  But harm alone is not enough; it has to be the right kind of harm.  Section 1983 provides a remedy only if the City has violated Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional <i>rights</i>, not if it has merely caused him harm.  Restated in the language of tort law, Heffernan\xe2\x80\x99s injury must result from activities within the zone of interests that \xc2\xa71983 protects.  Cf. <i>Lexmark Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc. </i>v. <i>Static Control Components, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa05 (2014) (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa05) (discussing the zone-of-interests test in the context of negligence <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The mere fact that the government has acted unconstitutionally does not necessarily result in the violation of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights, even when that individual has been injured.  Consider, for example, a law that authorized police to stop motorists arbitrarily to check their licenses and registration.  That law would violate the\n \nFourth Amendment.  See <i>Delaware </i>v. <i>Prouse</i>,\n\n440 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648,\n661 (1979)\n.  And motorists who were <i>not</i> stopped might suffer an injury from the unconstitutional policy; for example, they might face significant traffic delays.  But these motorists would not have a \xc2\xa71983 claim simply because they were injured pursuant to an unconstitutional policy.  This is because they have not suffered the right kind of injury.  They must allege, instead, that their injury amounted to a violation of their constitutional right against unreasonable seizures\xe2\x80\x94that is, by being unconstitutionally detained.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here too, Heffernan must allege more than an injury from an unconstitutional policy.  He must establish that this policy infringed his constitutional rights to speak freely and peaceably assemble.  Even if the majority is correct that demoting Heffernan for a politically motivated reason was beyond the scope of the City\xe2\x80\x99s power, the City never invaded <i>Heffernan</i>\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak or assemble.  Accordingly, he is not entitled to money damages under \xc2\xa71983 for the nonviolation of his\n \nFirst Amendment rights.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority tries to distinguish the\n \nFourth Amendment by emphasizing the textual differences between that Amendment and the First.  See <i>ante, </i>at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike, say the\n \nFourth Amendment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0, the\n \nFirst Amendment begins by focusing upon the activity of the Government\xe2\x80\x9d).  But these textual differences are immaterial.  All rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights \xe2\x80\x9cfocu[s] upon the activity of the Government\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9ctak[ing] certain policy choices off the table.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>District of Columbia </i>v. <i>Heller</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570,\n636 (2008)\n; see also Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions As Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 16, 30, 55\xe2\x80\x9357 (1913) (recognizing that an immunity implies a corresponding lack of power).\n \nFourth Amendment rights could be restated in terms of governmental power with no change in substantive meaning.  Thus, the mere fact that the\n \nFirst Amendment begins \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law\xe2\x80\x9d does not broaden a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sue to vindicate his freedoms of speech and assembly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To reach the opposite conclusion, the majority relies only on <i>Waters</i> v. <i>Churchill</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661 (1994)\n (plurality opinion).  See <i>ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  But <i>Waters</i> does not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of \xc2\xa71983 to cases where the employee did not exercise his\n \nFirst Amendment rights.  The issue in <i>Waters </i>was whether a public employer violated the\n \nFirst Amendment where it reasonably believed that the speech it proscribed was unprotected.  The Court concluded that the employer did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment because it reasonably believed the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech was unprotected: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have never held that it is a violation of the Constitution for a government employer to discharge an employee based on substantively incorrect information.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 679.  And the Court reaffirmed that, to state a\n \nFirst Amendment retaliation claim, the public employee must allege that she spoke on a matter of public concern.  See <i>id.,</i> at 681.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the employee in <i>Waters</i>, Heffernan admits that he was not engaged in constitutionally protected activity.  Accordingly, unlike in <i>Waters, </i>he cannot allege that his employer interfered with conduct protected by the\n \nFirst Amendment.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hat is sauce for the goose\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9csauce for the gander,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 6, when the goose speaks and the gander does not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If the facts are as Heffernan has alleged, the City\xe2\x80\x99s demotion of him may be misguided or wrong.  But, because Heffernan concedes that he did not exercise his\n \nFirst Amendment rights, he has no cause of action under \xc2\xa71983.  I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Factual impossibility occurs when \xe2\x80\x9can actor engages in conduct designed to culminate in the commission of an offense that is impossible for him to consummate under the existing circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 P.
