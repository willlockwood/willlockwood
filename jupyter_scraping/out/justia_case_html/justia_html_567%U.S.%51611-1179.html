Code Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93 35\xe2\x80\x93227(1) (2011).  The Montana Supreme Court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that this statute violates the \n \nFirst Amendment.  2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.\xc2\xa03d 1.  In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, this Court struck down a similar federal law, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical speech does not lose \n \nFirst Amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 26) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The question presented in this case is whether the holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state law.  There can be no serious doubt that it does.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl. 2.  Montana\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in support of the judgment below either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970518">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tAMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., fka WESTERN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC., et\xc2\xa0al. v.

Federal Election Commission, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  558 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 42).  I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hold- ing for the reasons expressed in Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 dissent in that case.  As Justice Stevens explained, \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 67\xe2\x80\x9368).  Indeed, Justice Stevens recounted a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial body of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any corporate independent expenditures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64\xe2\x80\x9365).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, even if I were to accept Citizens United, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion should not bar the Montana Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding, made on the record before it, that independent expenditures by corporations did in fact lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption in Montana.  Given the history and political landscape in Montana, that court concluded that the State had a compelling interest in limiting independent expenditures by corporations.  2011 MT 328, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 36\xe2\x80\x9337, 363 Mont. 220, 235\xe2\x80\x93236, 271 P.\xc2\xa03d 1, 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  Thus, Montana\xe2\x80\x99s experience, like considerable experience elsewhere since the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Citizens United, casts grave doubt on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s supposition that independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWere the matter up to me, I would vote to grant the petition for certiorari in order to reconsider Citizens United or, at least, its application in this case.  But given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s per curiam disposition, I do not see a significant possibility of reconsideration.  Consequently, I vote instead to deny the petition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
