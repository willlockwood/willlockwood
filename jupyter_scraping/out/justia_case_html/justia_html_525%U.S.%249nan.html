She was then transferred to another facility, where her condition deteriorated significantly. Petitioner Roberts, her guardian, filed a \xc2\xa7 1395dd(d) action, alleging \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b) violations. The District Court granted respondent summary judgment on the grounds that petitioner had failed to show that either the medical opinion that Johnson was stable or the decision to transfer her was caused by an improper motive.

Johnson had been severely injured and had suffered serious injuries to her brain, spine, right leg, and pelvis. After about six weeks\' stay at Humana, during which time Johnson\'s health remained in a volatile state, respondent\'s agents arranged for her transfer to the Crestview Health Care Facility, across the river in Indiana. Johnson was transferred to Crestview on July 24, 1992, but upon arrival at that facility, her condition deteriorated significantly. Johnson was taken to the Midwest Medical Center, also in Indiana, where she remained for many months and incurred substantial medical expenses as a result of her deterioration. Johnson applied for financial assistance under Indiana\'s Medicaid program, but her application was rejected on the ground that she had failed to satisfy Indiana\'s residency requirements. Petitioner Jane Roberts, Johnson\'s guardian, then filed this</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="252">252</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>federal action under \xc2\xa7 1395dd(d) as codified, alleging violations of \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b).</p><p>The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent on the grounds that petitioner had failed to show that" \'either the medical opinion that Johnson was stable or the decision to authorize her transfer was caused by an improper motive.\'" <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/111/405/">111 F.3d 405</a>, 407 <i>(CA6 </i>1997). The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that in order to state a claim in an EMTALA suit alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b)\'s stabilization requirement, a plaintiff must show that the hospital\'s inappropriate stabilization resulted from an improper motive such as one involving the indigency, race, or sex of the patient. <i>Id., </i>at 411. In order to decide whether subsection (b) imposes such a requirement, we granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 915 (1998), and now reverse.</p><p>The Court of Appeals\' holding-that proof of improper motive was necessary for recovery under \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b)\'s stabilization requirement-extended earlier Circuit precedent deciding that the "appropriate medical screening" duty under \xc2\xa7 1395dd(a) also required proof of an improper motive. See <i>Cleland </i>v. <i>Bronson Health Care Group, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/917/266/">917 F.2d 266</a> <i>(CA6 </i>1990). The Court of Appeals in <i>Cleland </i>was concerned that Congress\' use of the word "appropriate" in \xc2\xa7 1395dd(a) might be interpreted incorrectly to permit federal liability under EMTALA for any violation covered by state malpractice law. <i>Id., </i>at 271. Accordingly, rather than interpret EMTALA so as to cover "at a minimum, the full panoply of state malpractice law, and at a maximum, ... a guarantee of a successful result" in medical treatment, ibid., the Court of Appeals read \xc2\xa7 1395dd(a)\'s "appropriate medical screening" duty as requiring a plaintiff to show an improper reason why he or she received "less than standard attention [upon arrival] ... at the emergency room," id., at 272.</p><p>Unlike the provision of EMTALA at issue in <i>Cleland, </i>\xc2\xa7 1395dd(a), the provision at issue in this case, \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b), contains no requirement of appropriateness. Subsection</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="253">253</a></p><p>(b)(l)(A) requires instead the provision of "such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition." 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b)(1)(A). The question of the correctness of the <i>Cleland </i>court\'s reading of \xc2\xa7 1395dd(a)\'s "appropriate medical screening" requirement is not before us, and we express no opinion on it here.1 But there is no question that the text of \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b) does not require an "appropriate" stabilization, nor can it reasonably be read to require an improper motive. This fact is conceded by respondent, which notes in its brief that "the \'motive\' test adopted by the court below ... lacks support in any of the traditional sources of statutory construction." Brief for Respondent 17. Although the concession of a point on appeal by respondent is by no means dispositive of a legal issue, we take it as further indication of the correctness of our decision today, and hold that \xc2\xa7 1395dd(b) contains no express or implied "improper motive" requirement.</p><p>Although respondent presents two alternative grounds for the affirmance of the decision below,2 we decline to address these claims at this stage in the litigation. The Court granted certiorari on only the EMTALA issue, and these claims do not appear to have been sufficiently developed</p><p>1 We note, however, that <i>Cleland\'s </i>interpretation of subsection (a) is in conflict with the law of other Circuits which do not read subsection (a) as imposing an improper motive requirement.
