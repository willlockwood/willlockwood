CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals below rightly issued its writ of mandamus to the district court to correct that court\'s alleged error in striking respondents\' pleas in abatement to a criminal indictment.</p>\n<p>An indictment returned in June, 1941, by the grand jury sitting in the district court for Southern California, charged respondents and others with conspiracy to fix the price of evaporated milk sold in interstate commerce in violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 3.  The indictment recited that the grand jury which returned it had been impaneled at the November, 1940, term of court; that it had "begun but not finished during said November 1940 Term of said Court, an investigation of the matters charged in this indictment;" and that, by order of the court, the grand jury had continued to sit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 319 U. S. 23</a></p><p> during the March, 1941, term "for the sole purpose of finishing investigations begun but not completed during said November Term."</p>\n<p>In September, 1941, respondents filed pleas in abatement, asking that the indictment be quashed for want of jurisdiction of the court, on averments that the minutes of the grand jury for its meeting of February 28, 1941, disclosed that no investigation of any matter mentioned in the indictment had been "begun" by the grand jury within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 284 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 421, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] during the November, 1940, term of court, which expired March 2, 1941. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government filed replications denying generally all the allegations of the pleas, and the issues thus raised </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 319 U. S. 24</a></p><p> were set for trial before a jury.  Thereafter, leave was granted to the Government to withdraw its replications and to file demurrers to the pleas, and motions to strike them because insufficient in law, because they failed to state specific facts with sufficient certainty, and because they alleged facts which could not be within the pleaders\' knowledge.  After argument, the district court sustained the demurrers and granted the motions.  Respondents thereupon instituted the present proceeding by their petition to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, praying that a writ of mandamus issue directing petitioners -- the Honorable Michael J. Roche, district judge, and the district court -- to reinstate the pleas in abatement and the Government\'s replications and to set the issues raised by the pleas and replications for jury trial.</p>\n<p>On the petition for the writ and the Government\'s return, the court of appeals ordered the writ to issue.  126 F.2d 467.  Upon rehearing before the full court sitting en banc, the court held that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ; that the district court had erred in striking the pleas in abatement; that the case was an appropriate one for intervention by mandamus, and that the writ should issue directing petitioners to reinstate the pleas in abatement and the replications, and to try the issues of fact thus raised.  130 F.2d 843.  The court of appeals seems to have regarded the district court\'s order striking the pleas in abatement as in effect a refusal to act upon the pleas, 130 F.2d 845.  We granted certiorari, 318 U.S. 747, on a petition which set up that the circuit court of appeals erred in directing that mandamus issue, and in holding that the district court erred in striking the pleas in abatement.</p>\n<p>Petitioners concede that the circuit court of appeals, like this Court, may, as provided by \xc2\xa7 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 377,</p>\n<p>"issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 319 U. S. 25</a></p><p> exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law."</p>\n<p><em>McClellan v. Carland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/case.html">217 U. S. 268</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/case.html#279">217 U. S. 279</a></span>; <em>Adams v. United States ex rel.

They argue that as the district court\'s order striking the pleas in abatement was an exercise of its jurisdiction, its action is reviewable only on appeal and not by mandamus, and that, since, by Congressional enactment and policy, appellate review of the district court\'s order may be had only on review of a final judgment of conviction, that legislation and policy are not to be circumvented by resort to mandamus.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, these are valid objections to the exercise by the circuit court of appeals of its discretionary power to issue the writ.</p>\n<p>As the jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals is exclusively appellate, its authority to issue writs of mandamus is restricted by statute to those cases in which the writ is in aid of that jurisdiction.  Its authority is not confined to the issuance of writs in aid of a jurisdiction already acquired by appeal, but extends to those cases which are within its appellate jurisdiction although no appeal has been perfected.  Otherwise, the appellate jurisdiction could be defeated and the purpose of the statute authorizing the writ thwarted by unauthorized action of the district court obstructing the appeal.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/634/case.html">Ex parte Bradstreet,</a></span></em> 7 Pet. 634; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/258/case.html">Insurance Company v.

Hence, the question presented on this record is not whether the court below had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 319 U. S. 26</a></p><p> power to grant the writ, but whether, in the light of all the circumstances, the case was an appropriate one for the exercise of that power.  In determining what is appropriate, we look to those principles which should guide judicial discretion in the use of an extraordinary remedy, rather than to formal rules rigorously controlling judicial action.  Considerations of importance to our answer here are that the trial court, in striking the pleas in abatement, acted within its jurisdiction as a district court; that no action or omission on its part has thwarted or tends to thwart appellate review of the ruling, and that, while a function of mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction is to remove obstacles to appeal, it may not appropriately be used merely as a substitute for the appeal procedure prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p>The traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate jurisdiction, both at common law and in the federal courts, has been to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.  <em>Ex parte Peru, supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/case.html#584">318 U.

Even in such cases, appellate courts are reluctant to interfere with the decision of a lower court on jurisdictional questions which it was competent to decide and which are reviewable in the regular course of appeal.  <em>Ex parte Harding,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/219/363/case.html">219 U.

Its jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants, and of the subject matter charged by the indictment, is not questioned.  This is not a case like <em>Ex parte Bain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/121/1/case.html">121 U.

S. 27</a></p><p> been amended after it was returned by the grand jury, was thought to be "no indictment of a grand jury."  Here, the indictment was returned by the requisite number of duly qualified grand jurors, acting under order of the court continuing the grand jury in session.  The objection that the subject matter of the indictment was not one which the jury had been or could be continued to hear was, at most, an irregularity which, if the proper subject of a plea in abatement, did not affect the jurisdiction of the court.  <em>Cf.

Carland, supra.</em> <em>Compare Ex parte United States, supra.</em>  In sustaining the Government\'s demurrers to the pleas and its motions to strike, the district court did not, as the court below seemed to think, refuse to act on the pleas.  Instead, it held that they were insufficient in law to abate the criminal prosecution.  In thus ruling on questions of law decisive of the issue presented by the pleas and replications, the district court acted within its jurisdiction as a federal court to decide issues properly brought before it.  Its decision, even if erroneous -- a question on which we do not pass -- involved no abuse of judicial power, and any error which it may have committed is reviewable by the circuit court of appeals upon appeal appropriately taken from a final judgment and by this Court by writ of certiorari.

We may assume, as they allege, that that trial may be of several months\' duration and may be correspondingly costly and inconvenient.  But that inconvenience is one which we must take it Congress contemplated in providing that only final judgments should be reviewable.  Where the appeal statutes establish the conditions of appellate review, an appellate court cannot rightly exercise its discretion to issue a writ whose only effect would be to avoid those conditions and thwart the Congressional policy against piecemeal appeals in criminal cases.  <em>Cobbledick v.

Here, the inconvenience to the litigants results alone from the circumstance that Congress has provided for review of the district court\'s order only on review of the final judgment, and not from an abuse of judicial power, or refusal to exercise it, which it is the function of mandamus to correct.  Hence, there are in this case no special circumstances which would justify the issuance of the writ, such as the persistent disregard of the Rules of Civil Procedure, prescribed by this court, found in <em>McCullough v.

In <em>Ex parte Simons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/247/231/case.html">247 U. S. 231</a></span>, the writ directed the district court to set aside its order transferring to the equity docket a case plainly triable at law by jury.  The district court\'s order was regarded by this Court "as having repudiated jurisdiction" of the suit.  In <em>Ex parte Peterson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/300/case.html">253 U. S. 300</a></span>, in which the writ was sought similarly to compel the district court to set aside its order referring the cause to an auditor, the application was denied because the order was held not to preclude a jury trial.  And in <em>Ex parte Skinner &amp; Eddy Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/265/86/case.html">265 U. S. 86</a></span>, the writ prohibited the Court of Claims from exercising jurisdiction, contrary to statute, over a suit which it had previously dismissed.  There, its assumption of jurisdiction would have deprived the litigants of trial by jury in a state court where an action against an agency of the United States involving the same issue was pending.  Thus, in the two cases in which the writ was granted, it was issued in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to compel an inferior court to relinquish a jurisdiction which it could not lawfully exercise or to exercise a jurisdiction which it had unlawfully repudiated.  <em>Cf. Ex parte Peru, supra.</em>  In the present case, the district court has acted within its jurisdiction and has rendered a decision which, even if erroneous, involved no abuse of judicial power.  In issuing the writ, the court of appeals below has done no more than substitute mandamus for an appeal contrary to the statutes and the policy of Congress, which has restricted that court\'s appellate review to final judgments of the district court.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

Asparagus and Cherries."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In the court below, petitioners urged that the decision of the district court in striking the pleas in abatement could not have been reviewed by the circuit court of appeals after final judgment by reason of R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011, which has been carried over in substance into 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 879.  R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011 provides:</p>\n<p>"There shall be no reversal in the Supreme Court or in a circuit court of appeals upon a writ of error, for error in ruling any plea in abatement, other than a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, or for any error in fact."</p>\n<p>This provision was taken from \xc2\xa7 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 84, a section which was in terms applicable only to civil cases.  Neither the Judiciary Act of 1789 nor the Revised Statutes made any provision for review of federal criminal cases on writ of error, although R.S. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 651 and 697 provided for certification to the Supreme Court of questions arising in criminal cases.  Review on writ of error of criminal cases in the federal courts was first established by the Act of Mar. 3, 1879, 20 Stat. 354, authorizing review of district court decisions by circuit courts.  By \xc2\xa7 6 of the Act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 655, 656, the Supreme Court was given appellate review of capital cases on writ of error, and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5 and 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1891, 26 Stat. 826, 827, 828, abolished the appellate powers of the circuit courts, enlarged the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and authorized review of criminal cases tried in the circuit and district courts by the circuit courts of appeals on writ of error.</p>\n<p>None of these acts contains any provision making applicable to criminal cases reviewed on writ of error the limitations which \xc2\xa7 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 imposed on such review of civil cases.  Although R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011 is phrased in terms of general applicability, it was held in <em>Buck Stove Co. v. Vickers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/226/205/case.html">226 U. S. 205</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/226/205/case.html#213">226 U. S. 213</a></span>, that the rearrangement and rewording in the Revised Statutes of \xc2\xa7 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was not intended to change the meaning of that section, and that, since \xc2\xa7 22 had applied only to cases from federal courts, R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011 did not prevent consideration of a ruling on a plea in abatement in a case on writ of error from a state court.  We think that similar reasoning applies here to preclude the section\'s application to criminal cases, to which in its original form it did not apply.</p>\n<p>In a large number of criminal cases, this Court and the circuit courts of appeals have reviewed on the merits decisions overruling or refusing to entertain pleas in abatement, although without reference to R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011.  <em>Agnew v.

United States,</em> 149 F. 673.  A few circuit courts of appeals have said that the section prevented appellate consideration of a decision overruling a plea in abatement to an indictment, although also holding that the pleas were properly overruled.  <em>Mounday v.

And the section has on occasion been cited as precluding appellate review of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence in criminal cases -- a proposition which hardly needs its support.  <em>Miles v.

United States,</em> 1 F.2d 612, 613; <em>Kinser v. United States,</em> 231 F. 856, 861.  The fact that the great majority of appellate decisions, including all in this Court, have considered pleas in abatement on the merits, establishes a practice, beginning soon after the first authorization of criminal appellate review, which is persuasive of the statutory intent.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that R.S. \xc2\xa7 1011 is inapplicable to criminal cases is reinforced by a consideration of the kinds of objections which in a criminal case may properly be the subjects of a plea in abatement.  Although frequently described as a dilatory plea which should be strictly construed, <em>United States v. Greene,</em> 113 F. 683, 688, 689, such a plea is an appropriate means of raising objections to an indictment which may involve serious and prejudicial infringements of procedural rights, such as an objection to the qualifications of grand jurors.  <em>Crowley v.
