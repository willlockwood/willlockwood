Hepps is the principal stockholder of General Programming, Inc. (GPI), a corporation that franchises a chain of stores -- known at the relevant time as "Thrifty" stores -- selling beer, soft drinks, and snacks.  Mr. Hepps, GPI, and a number of its franchisees are the appellees here. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Appellant Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., owns the Philadelphia Inquirer (Inquirer).  The Inquirer published a series of articles, authored by appellants William Ecenbarger and William Lambert, containing the statements at issue here.  The general theme of the five articles, which appeared in the Inquirer between May, 1975, and May, 1976, was that appellees had links to organized crime and used some of those links to influence the State\'s governmental processes, both legislative and administrative.  The articles discussed a state legislator, described as "a Pittsburgh Democrat and convicted felon,"App. A60, whose actions displayed "a clear pattern of interference in state government by [the legislator] on behalf of Hepps and Thrifty," <em>id.</em> at A62-A63.  The stories reported that federal "investigators have found connections between Thrifty and underworld figures," <em>id.</em> at A65; that "the Thrifty Beverage beer chain . . . had connections . . . with organized crime," <em>id.</em> at A80; and that Thrifty had "won a series of competitive advantages through rulings by the State Liquor Control Board," <em>id.</em> at A65.  A grand jury was said to be investigating the "alleged relationship between the Thrifty chain and known Mafia figures," and "[w]hether the chain received special treatment from the [state Governor\'s] administration and the Liquor Control Board."  <em>Id.</em> at A68. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 475 U. S. 770</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellees brought suit for defamation against appellants in a Pennsylvania state court.  Consistent with <em>Gertz, supra,</em> Pennsylvania requires a private figure who brings a suit for defamation to bear the burden of proving negligence or malice by the defendant in publishing the statements at issue.  42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 8344 (1982).  As to falsity, Pennsylvania follows the common law\'s presumption that an individual\'s reputation is a good one.  Statements defaming that person are therefore presumptively false, although a publisher who bears the burden of proving the truth of the statements has an absolute defense.  <em>See</em> 506 Pa. 304, 313-314, 485 A.2d 374, 379 (1984).  <em>See also</em> 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 8343(b)(1) (1982) (defendant has the burden of proving the truth of a defamatory statement).  <em>Cf. Gertz, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#349">418 U. S. 349</a></span> (common law presumes injury to reputation from publication of defamatory statements).  <em>See generally</em> Eaton, The American Law of Defamation Through <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</em> and Beyond:  An Analytical Primer, 61 Va.L.Rev. 1349, 1352-1357 (1975) (describing common law scheme of defamation law).</p>\n<p>The parties first raised the issue of burden of proof as to falsity before trial, but the trial court reserved its ruling on the matter.  Appellee Hepps testified at length that the statements at issue were false, Tr. 2221-2290, and he extensively cross-examined the author of the stories as to the veracity of the statements at issue.  After all the evidence had been presented by both sides, the trial court concluded that Pennsylvania\'s statute giving the defendant the burden of proving the truth of the statements violated the Federal Constitution.  <em>Id.</em> at 3589.  The trial court therefore instructed the jury that the plaintiffs bore the burden of proving falsity.  <em>Id.</em> at 3848.</p>\n<p>During the trial, appellants took advantage of Pennsylvania\'s "shield law" on a number of occasions.  That law allows employees of the media to refuse to divulge their sources.  <em>See</em> 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5942(a) (1982) ("No person . . . employed by any newspaper of general circulation . . . or any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 475 U. S. 771</a></p><p> radio or television station, or any magazine of general circulation, . . . shall be required to disclose the source of any information procured or obtained by such person, in any legal proceeding, trial or investigation before any government unit").  <em>See also</em> 506 Pa. at 327, 485 A.2d at 387 ("This statute has been interpreted broadly").  Appellees requested an instruction stating that the jury could draw a negative inference from appellants\' assertions of the shield law; appellants requested an instruction that the jury could not draw any inferences from those exercises of the shield law\'s privilege.  The trial judge declined to give either instruction.  Tr. 3806-3808.  The jury ruled for appellants and therefore awarded no damages to appellees.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Pennsylvania statute, 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 722(7) (1982), the appellees here brought an appeal directly to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  That court viewed <em>Gertz</em> as simply requiring the plaintiff to show fault in actions for defamation.  It concluded that a showing of fault did not require a showing of falsity, held that to place the burden of showing truth on the defendant did not unconstitutionally inhibit free debate, and remanded the case for a new trial.

In addition, the Court in <em>Gertz</em> expressly held that, although a showing of simple fault sufficed to allow recovery for actual damages, even a private-figure plaintiff was required to show actual malice in order to recover presumed or punitive damages.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#348">418 U.

A plurality of the Court in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet</em> was convinced that, in a case with such a configuration of speech and plaintiff, the showing of actual malice needed to recover punitive damages under either <em>New York Times</em> or <em>Gertz</em> was unnecessary:</p>\n<p>"In light of the reduced constitutional value of speech involving no matters of public concern, we hold that the state interest [in preserving private reputation] adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 475 U.

The first is whether the plaintiff is a public official or figure, or is instead a private figure.  The second is whether the speech at issue is of public concern.  When the speech is of public concern and the plaintiff is a public official or public figure, the Constitution clearly requires the plaintiff to surmount a much higher barrier before recovering damages from a media defendant than is raised by the common law.  When the speech is of public concern but the plaintiff is a private figure, as in <em>Gertz,</em> the Constitution still supplants the standards of the common law, but the constitutional requirements are, in at least some of their range, less forbidding than when the plaintiff is a public figure and the speech is of public concern.  When the speech is of exclusively private concern and the plaintiff is a private figure, as in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet,</em> the constitutional requirements do not necessarily force any change in at least some of the features of the common law landscape.</p>\n<p>Our opinions to date have chiefly treated the necessary showings of fault, rather than of falsity.  Nonetheless, as one might expect given the language of the Court in <em>New York Times, see supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/767/case.html#772">475 U. S. 772</a></span>-773, a public-figure plaintiff must show the falsity of the statements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defamation.  <em>See Garrison v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/64/case.html">379 U. S. 64</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/64/case.html#74">379 U.

S. 776</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Here, as in <em>Gertz,</em> the plaintiff is a private figure and the newspaper articles are of public concern.  In <em>Gertz,</em> as in <em>New York Times,</em> the common law rule was superseded by a constitutional rule.  We believe that the common law\'s rule on falsity -- that the defendant must bear the burden of proving truth -- must similarly fall here to a constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity, as well as fault, before recovering damages.</p>\n<p>There will always be instances when the factfinding process will be unable to resolve conclusively whether the speech is true or false; it is in those cases that the burden of proof is dispositive.  Under a rule forcing the plaintiff to bear the burden of showing falsity, there will be some cases in which plaintiffs cannot meet their burden despite the fact that the speech is, in fact, false.  The plaintiff\'s suit will fail despite the fact that, in some abstract sense, the suit is meritorious.  Similarly, under an alternative rule placing the burden of showing truth on defendants, there would be some cases in which defendants could not bear their burden despite the fact that the speech is in fact true.  Those suits would succeed despite the fact that, in some abstract sense, those suits are unmeritorious.  Under either rule, then, the outcome of the suit will sometimes be at variance with the outcome that we would desire if all speech were either demonstrably true or demonstrably false.</p>\n<p>This dilemma stems from the fact that the allocation of the burden of proof will determine liability for some speech that is true and some that is false, but <em>all</em> of such speech is <em>unknowably</em> true or false.  Because the burden of proof is the deciding factor only when the evidence is ambiguous, we cannot know how much of the speech affected by the allocation of the burden of proof is true and how much is false.  In a case presenting a configuration of speech and plaintiff like the one we face here, and where the scales are in such an uncertain balance, we believe that the Constitution requires us to tip them in favor of protecting true speech.  To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 475 U.

It is not immediately apparent from the text of the First Amendment, which by its terms applies only to governmental action, that a similar result should obtain here:  a suit by a private party is obviously quite different from the government\'s direct enforcement of its own laws.  Nonetheless, the need to encourage debate on public issues that concerned the Court in the governmental restriction cases is of concern in a similar manner in this case involving a private suit for damages:  placement by state law of the burden of proving truth upon media defendants who publish speech of public concern deters such speech because of the fear that liability will unjustifiably result.  <em>See New York Times,</em> 376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#279">376 U.

Because such a "chilling" effect would be antithetical to the First Amendment\'s protection of true speech on matters of public concern, we believe that a private-figure plaintiff must bear the burden of showing that the speech at issue is false before recovering damages for defamation from a media defendant.  To do otherwise could "only result in a deterrence of speech which the Constitution makes free."  <em>Speiser, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html#526">357 U.

Nonetheless, the Court\'s previous decisions on the restrictions that the First Amendment places upon the common law of defamation firmly support our conclusion here with respect to the allocation of the burden of proof.  In attempting to resolve related issues in the defamation context, the Court has affirmed that "[t]he First Amendment requires that we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters."  <em>Gertz,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#341">418 U.

The plaintiff must show fault.  A jury is obviously more likely to accept a plaintiff\'s contention that the defendant was at fault in publishing the statements at issue if convinced that the relevant statements were false.  As a practical matter, then, evidence offered by plaintiffs on the publisher\'s fault in adequately investigating the truth of the published statements will generally encompass evidence of the falsity of the matters asserted.  <em>See</em> Keeton, Defamation and Freedom of the Press, 54 Texas L.Rev. 1221, 1236 (1976).  <em>See also</em> Franklin &amp; Bussel, The Plaintiff\'s Burden in Defamation:  Awareness and Falsity, 25 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 825, 856-857 (1984). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 475 U.

I do not agree that our precedents require a private individual to bear the risk that a defamatory statement -- uttered either with a mind toward assassinating his good name or with careless indifference to that possibility -- cannot be proven false.  By attaching no weight to the State\'s interest in protecting the private individual\'s good name, the Court has reached a pernicious result.\n</em></p>\n<p>The state interest in preventing and redressing injuries to reputation is obviously important.

But this does not mean that the right is entitled to any less recognition by this Court as a basic of our constitutional system."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>". . .  The First and Fourteenth Amendments have not stripped private citizens of all means of redress for injuries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 475 U.

Yet, imperfect though it is, an action for damages is the only hope for vindication or redress the law gives to a man whose reputation has been falsely dishonored."</p>\n<p>"Moreover, the preventive effect of liability for defamation serves an important public purpose.  For the rights and values of private personality far transcend mere personal interests.  Surely if the 1950\'s taught us anything, they taught us that the poisonous atmosphere of the easy lie can infect and degrade a whole society. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]"</p>\n<p>While deliberate or inadvertent libels vilify private personages, they contribute little to the marketplace of ideas.  In assaying the First Amendment side of the balance, it helps to remember that the perpetrator of the libel suffers from its failure to demonstrate the truth of its accusation only if the "private-figure" plaintiff first establishes that the publisher is at "fault," 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#347">418 U. S. 347</a></span> -- <em>i.e.,</em> either that it published its libel with "actual malice" in the <em>New York Times</em> sense ("with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not," <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#279">376 U. S. 279</a></span>-280 (1964)), or that it published with that degree of careless indifference characteristic of negligence.  Far from being totally in the dark about "how much </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 475 U. S. 783</a></p><p> of the speech affected by the allocation of the burden of proof is true and how much is false," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/767/case.html#776">475 U. S. 776</a></span>, the antecedent fault determination makes irresistible the inference that a significant portion of this speech is beyond the constitutional pale. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  This observation is almost tautologically true with regard to libels published with "actual malice."  For that standard to be met, the publisher must come close to willfully blinding itself to the falsity of its utterance. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The observation is also valid, albeit to a lesser extent, with respect to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 475 U. S. 784</a></p><p> defamations uttered with "fault." [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Thus, while the public\'s interest in an uninhibited press is at its nadir when the publisher is at fault or worse, society\'s "equally compelling" need </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 475 U. S. 785</a></p><p> for judicial redress of libelous utterances is at its zenith.  <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/448/case.html">424 U. S. 448</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/448/case.html#456">424 U. S. 456</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>To appreciate the thrust of the Court\'s holding, we must assume that a private-figure libel plaintiff can prove that a story about him was published with "actual malice" -- that is, without the publisher\'s caring in the slightest whether it was false or not.  Indeed, in order to comprehend the full ramifications of today\'s decision, we should assume that the publisher knew that it would be impossible for a court to verify or discredit the story, and that it was published for no other purpose than to destroy the reputation of the plaintiff.  Even if the plaintiff has overwhelming proof of malice -- in both the common law sense and as the term was used in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</em> -- the Court today seems to believe that the character assassin has a constitutional license to defame. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In my opinion deliberate, malicious character assassination is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  That Amendment does require the target of a defamatory statement to prove that his assailant was at fault, and I agree that it provides a constitutional shield for truthful statements.  I simply do not understand, however, why a character assassin should be given an absolute license to defame by means of statements that can be neither verified nor disproved.  The danger of deliberate defamation by reference to unprovable facts is not a merely speculative or hypothetical concern.  Lack of knowledge about third parties, the loss of critical records, an uncertain recollection about events that occurred long ago, perhaps during a period of special stress, the absence of eyewitnesses -- a host of factors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="786">Page 475 U. S. 786</a></p><p> -- may make it impossible for an honorable person to disprove malicious gossip about his past conduct, his relatives, his friends, or his business associates.</p>\n<p>The danger of which I speak can be illustrated within the confines of this very case.  Appellants published a series of five articles proclaiming that "Federal authorities . . . have found connections between Thrifty and underworld figures," App. A65; that "Federal agents have evidence of direct financial involvement in Thrifty by [Joseph] Scalleat," a "leader of organized crime in northeastern Pennsylvania," <em>id.</em> at A72; and that "the Thrifty Beverage beer chain . . . had connections itself with organized crime," <em>id.</em> at A80. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The defamatory character of these statements is undisputed.  Yet the factual basis for the one specific allegation contained in them is based on an admitted relationship between appellees and a third party.  The truth or falsity of that statement depends on the character and conduct of that third party -- a matter which the jury may well have resolved against the plaintiffs on the ground that they could not disprove the allegation on which they bore the burden of proof. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Despite the obvious blueprint for character assassination provided by the decision today, the Court\'s analytical approach -- by attaching little or no weight to the strong state interest in redressing injury to private reputation -- provides a wholly unwarranted protection for malicious gossip.  As I understand the Court\'s opinion, its counterintuitive result is derived from a straightforward syllogism.  The major premise seems to be that "the First Amendment\'s protection of true speech on matters of public concern," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/767/case.html#777">475 U. S. 777</a></span>, is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 475 U. S. 787</a></p><p> tantamount to a command that no rule of law can stand if it will exclude any true speech from the public domain.  The minor premise is that, although "we cannot know how much of the speech affected by the allocation of the burden of proof is true and how much is false," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/767/case.html#776">475 U.

The error lies in its initial premise, with its mistaken belief that doubt regarding the veracity of a defamatory statement must invariably be resolved in favor of constitutional protection of the statement and against vindication of the reputation of the private individual.  To support its premise, the Court relies exclusively on our precedents requiring the government to bear the burden of proving that a restriction of speech is justified.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/767/case.html#777">475 U.

Whether such restrictions appear in the form of legislation burdening the speech of particular speakers or of particular points of view, or of common law actions punishing seditious libel, the Court is doubtlessly correct that the government or its agents must, at a minimum, shoulder the burden of proving that the speech is false, and must do so with sufficient reliability that we can be confident that true speech is not suppressed.
