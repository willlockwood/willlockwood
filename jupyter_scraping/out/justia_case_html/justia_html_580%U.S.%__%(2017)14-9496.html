Suspecting the pills to be illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test, which came back negative for any controlled substance.  Still, they arrested Manuel and took him to the police station.  There, an evidence technician tested the pills and got the same negative result, but claimed in his report that one of the pills tested \xe2\x80\x9cpositive for the probable presence of ecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 92.  An arresting officer also reported that, based on his \xe2\x80\x9ctraining and experience,\xe2\x80\x9d he \xe2\x80\x9cknew the pills to be ecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 91.  On the basis of those false statements, another officer filed a sworn complaint charging Manuel with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.  Relying exclusively on that complaint, a county court judge found probable cause to detain Manuel pending trial.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">While Manuel was in jail, the Illinois police laboratory tested the seized pills and reported that they contained no controlled substances.  But Manuel remained in custody, spending a total of 48 days in pretrial detention.  More than two years after his arrest, but less than two years after his criminal case was dismissed, Manuel filed a\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 lawsuit against Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City), alleging that his arrest and detention violated the\n \nFourth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s suit, holding, first, that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred his unlawful arrest claim, and, second, that under binding Circuit precedent, pretrial detention following the start of legal process (here, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination) could not give rise to a\n \nFourth Amendment claim.  Manuel appealed the dismissal of his unlawful detention claim; the Seventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on\n \nFourth Amendment grounds.  This conclusion follows from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s settled precedent.  In <i>Gerstein</i> v. <i>Pugh</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n, the Court decided that a pretrial detention challenge was governed by the\n \nFourth Amendment, noting that the\n \nFourth Amendment establishes the minimum constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cstandards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d not just for arrest but also for \xe2\x80\x9cdetention,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at 111, and \xe2\x80\x9calways has been thought to define\xe2\x80\x9d the appropriate process \xe2\x80\x9cfor seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 125, n. 27.  And in <i>Albright</i> v. <i>Oliver</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266\n, a majority of the Court again looked to the\n \nFourth Amendment to assess pretrial restraints on liberty.  Relying on <i>Gerstein</i>, the plurality reiterated that the\n \nFourth Amendment is the \xe2\x80\x9crelevan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional provision to assess the \xe2\x80\x9cdeprivations of liberty that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 274; see <i>id.,</i> at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ules of recovery for such harms have naturally coalesced under the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  That the pretrial restraints in <i>Albright </i>arose pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were allegedly unsupported by probable cause.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">As reflected in those cases, pretrial detention can violate the\n \nFourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process.  The\n \nFourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person absent probable cause.  And where legal process has gone forward, but has done nothing to satisfy the probable-cause requirement, it cannot extinguish a detainee\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim.  That was the case here: Because the judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination of probable cause was based solely on fabricated evidence, it did not expunge Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim.  For that reason, Manuel stated a\n \nFourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his arrest, but also for his pretrial detention.

The primary question in this case is whether Manuel may bring a claim based on the\n \nFourth Amendment to contest the legality of his pretrial confinement.  Our answer follows from settled precedent.  The\n \nFourth Amendment, this Court has recognized, establishes \xe2\x80\x9cthe standards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d governing pretrial detention.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gerstein</i> v. <i>Pugh</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,\n111 (1975)\n.  And those constitutional protections<b> </b>apply even after the start of \xe2\x80\x9clegal process\xe2\x80\x9d in a criminal case\xe2\x80\x94here, that is, after the judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination of probable cause.  See <i>Albright</i> v. <i>Oliver</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266,\n274 (1994)\n (plurality opinion); <i>id.</i>, at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).  Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that it violated the\n \nFourth Amendment (while we leave all other issues, including one about that claim\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness, to the court below).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.  A pair of Joliet police officers pulled the car over when the driver failed to signal a turn.  See App. 90.  According to the complaint in this case, one of the officers dragged Manuel from the car, called him a racial slur, and kicked and punched him as he lay on the ground.  See <i>id., </i>at 31\xe2\x80\x9332, 63.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The policeman then searched Manuel and found a vitamin bottle containing pills.  See <i>id.</i>, at 64.  Suspecting that the pills were actually illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test of the bottle\xe2\x80\x99s contents.  The test came back negative for any controlled substance, leaving the officers with no evidence that Manuel had committed a crime.  See <i>id.</i>, at 69.  Still, the officers arrested Manuel and took him to the Joliet police station.  See <i>id.</i>, at 70.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There, an evidence technician tested the pills once again, and got the same (negative) result.  See <i>ibid.  </i>But the technician lied in his report, claiming that one of the pills was \xe2\x80\x9cfound to be .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. positive for the probable presence of ecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 92.  Similarly, one of the arresting officers wrote in his report that \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]rom [\xc2\xa0his] training and experience, [\xc2\xa0he] knew the pills to be ecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 91.  On the basis of those statements, another officer swore out a criminal complaint against Manuel, charging him with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.  See <i>id.,</i> at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Manuel was brought before a county court judge later that day for a determination of whether there was probable cause for the charge, as necessary for further detention.  See <i>Gerstein</i>, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114 (requiring a judicial finding of probable cause following a warrantless arrest to impose any significant pretrial restraint on liberty); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \xc2\xa75/109\xe2\x80\x931 (West 2010) (implementing that constitutional rule).  The judge relied exclusively on the criminal complaint\xe2\x80\x94which in turn relied exclusively on the police department\xe2\x80\x99s fabrications\xe2\x80\x94to support a finding of probable cause.  Based on that determination, he sent Manuel to the county jail to await trial.  In the somewhat obscure legal lingo of this case, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent detention was thus pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9clegal process\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because it followed from, and was authorized by, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While Manuel sat in jail, the Illinois police laboratory reexamined the seized pills, and on April 1, it issued a report concluding (just as the prior two tests had) that they contained no controlled substances.  See App. 51.  But for unknown reasons, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x94and, critically for this case, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s detention\xe2\x80\x94continued for more than another month.  Only on May 4 did an Assistant State\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney seek dismissal of the drug charge.  See <i>id.</i>, at 48, 101.  The County Court immediately granted the request, and Manuel was released the next day.  In all, he had spent 48 days in pretrial detention.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City).  Section 1983 creates a \xe2\x80\x9cspecies of tort liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Imbler</i> v. <i>Pachtman</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409,\n417 (1976)\n, for \xe2\x80\x9cthe deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71983.  Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s complaint alleged that the City violated his\n \nFourth Amendment rights in two ways\xe2\x80\x94first by arresting him at the roadside without any reason, and next by \xe2\x80\x9cdetaining him in police custody\xe2\x80\x9d for almostseven weeks based entirely on made-up evidence.  See App. 79\xe2\x80\x9380.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court dismissed Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  See 2014 WL 551626 (ND Ill., Feb. 12, 2014).  The court first held that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim for unlawful arrest, because more than two years had elapsed between the date of his arrest (March 18, 2011) and the filing of his complaint (April 22, 2013).  But the court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to his subsequent detention (which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011).  Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a\n \nFourth Amendment claim.  See <i>id.</i>, at *1 (citing, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Newsome </i>v. <i>McCabe</i>, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 747, 750 (CA7 2001)).  According to that line of decisions, a \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x94and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.  See 2014 WL 551626, at *1\xe2\x80\x93*2.  Because Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s complaint rested solely on the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94and because, in any event, Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s remedies were robust enough to preclude the due process avenue\xe2\x80\x94the District Court found that Manuel had no way to proceed.  See <i>ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim for unlawful detention (the only part of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision Manuel appealed).  See 590 Fed. Appx. 641 (2015).  Invoking its prior caselaw, the Court of Appeals reiterated<b> </b>that such claims could not be brought under the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the detention is improper becomes [one of] due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 643\xe2\x80\x93644 (quoting <i>Llovet</i> v. <i>Chicago</i>, 761 F.\xc2\xa03d 759, 763 (CA7 2014)).  And again: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen, after the arrest[,] a person is not let go when he should be, the\n \nFourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention.\xe2\x80\x9d  590 Fed. Appx., at 643 (quoting <i>Llovet</i>, 761 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 764).  So the Seventh Circuit held that Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, in alleging only a\n \nFourth Amendment violation, rested on the wrong part of the Constitution: A person detained following the onset of legal process could at most (although, the court agreed, <i>not</i> in Illinois) challenge his pretrial confinement via the Due Process Clause.  See 590 Fed. Appx., at 643\xe2\x80\x93644.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Seventh Circuit recognized that its position makes it an outlier among the Courts of Appeals, with ten others taking the opposite view.  See <i>id.</i>, at 643; <i>Hernandez-Cuevas</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>, 723 F.\xc2\xa03d 91, 99 (CA1 2013) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is now broad consensus among the circuits that the\n \nFourth Amendment right to be free from seizure but upon probable cause extends through the pretrial period\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Still, the court decided, Manuel had failed to offer a sufficient reason for overturning settled Circuit precedent; his argument, albeit \xe2\x80\x9cstrong,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cbetter left for the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  590 Fed. Appx., at 643.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On cue,<b> </b>we granted certiorari.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. against unreasonable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s complaint seeks just that protection.  Government officials, it recounts, detained\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, \xe2\x80\x9cseiz[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Manuel for 48 days following his arrest.  See App. 79\xe2\x80\x9380; <i>Brendlin</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249,\n254 (2007)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA person is seized\xe2\x80\x9d whenever officials \xe2\x80\x9crestrain[ ] his freedom of movement\xe2\x80\x9d such that he is \xe2\x80\x9cnot free to leave\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that detention was \xe2\x80\x9cunreason-able,\xe2\x80\x9d the complaint continues, because it was based solely on false evidence, rather than supported by probable cause.  See App. 79\xe2\x80\x9380; <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186,\n192 (2013)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he general rule [is] that\n \nFourth Amendment seizures are \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 only if based on probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  By their respective terms, then, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim fits the\n \nFourth Amendment, and the\n \nFourth Amendment fits Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim, as hand in glove.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court decided some four decades ago that a claim challenging pretrial detention fell within the scope of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  In <i>Gerstein</i>, two persons<i> </i>arrested without a warrant brought a \xc2\xa71983 suit complaining that they had been held in custody for \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial period solely on the decision of a prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d  420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 106.  The Court looked to the\n \nFourth Amendment to analyze\xe2\x80\x94and uphold\xe2\x80\x94their claim that such a pretrial restraint on liberty is unlawful unless a judge (or grand jury) first makes a reliable finding of probable cause.  See <i>id.</i>, at 114, 117, n.\xc2\xa019.  The\n \nFourth Amendment, we began, establishes the minimum constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cstandards and procedures\xe2\x80\x9d not just for arrest but also for ensuing \xe2\x80\x9cdetention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 111.  In choosing that Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cas the rationale for decision,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court responded to a concurring Justice\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Due Process Clause offered the better framework: The\n \nFourth Amendment, the majority countered, was \xe2\x80\x9ctailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and it[ ] always has been thought to define\xe2\x80\x9d the appropriate process \xe2\x80\x9cfor seizures of person[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 125, n. 27.  That Amendment, standing alone, guaranteed \xe2\x80\x9ca fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 125.  Accordingly, those detained prior to trial without such a finding could appeal to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against unfounded invasions of liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 112; see <i>id.</i>, at 114.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And so too, a later decision indicates, those objecting to a pretrial deprivation of liberty may invoke the\n \nFourth Amendment when (as here) that deprivation occurs after legal process commences.  The \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff in <i>Albright </i>complained of various pretrial restraints imposed after a court found probable cause to issue an arrest warrant, and then bind him over for trial, based on a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s unfounded charges.  See 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 268\xe2\x80\x93269 (plurality opinion).  For uncertain reasons, Albright ignored the\n \nFourth Amendment in drafting his complaint; instead, he alleged that the defendant officer had infringed his substantive due process rights.  This Court rejected that claim, with five Justices in two opinions remitting Albright to the\n \nFourth Amendment.

The\n \nFourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6.  That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.  But it also can occur when legal process itself goes wrong\xe2\x80\x94when, for example, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s false statements.  Then, too, a person is confined without constitutionally adequate justification.  Legal process has gone forward, but it has done nothing to satisfy the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause requirement.  And for that reason, it cannot extinguish the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim\xe2\x80\x94or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.  See 590 Fed. Appx., at 643\xe2\x80\x93644.  If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the\n \nFourth Amendment.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For that reason,<b> </b>and contrary to the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, Manuel stated a\n \nFourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his (pre-legal-process) arrest, but also for his (post-legal-process) pretrial detention.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Consider again the facts alleged in this case.  Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.  So (putting timeliness issues aside) Manuel could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the\n \nFourth Amendment.  And the same is true (again, disregarding timeliness) as to a claim for wrongful detention\xe2\x80\x94because Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent weeks in custody were <i>also</i> unsupported by probable cause, and so <i>also </i>constitutionally<i> </i>unreasonable.  No evidence of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s criminality had come to light in between the roadside arrest and the County Court proceeding initiating legal process; to the contrary, yet another test of Man-uel\xe2\x80\x99s pills had come back negative in that period.  Allthat the judge had before him were police fabrications about the pills\xe2\x80\x99 content.  The judge\xe2\x80\x99s order holding Manuel for trial therefore lacked any proper basis.  And that means Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing pretrial detention, no less than his original arrest, violated his\n \nFourth Amendment rights.  Or put just a bit differently: Legal process did not<b> </b>expunge<b> </b>Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim because the process he received failed to establish what that Amendment makes essential for pretrial detention\xe2\x80\x94probable cause to believe he committed a crime.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our holding\xe2\x80\x94that the\n \nFourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process\xe2\x80\x94does not exhaust the disputed legal issues in this case.  It addresses only the threshold inquiry in a \xc2\xa71983 suit, which requires courts to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify<b> </b>the specific constitutional right\xe2\x80\x9d at issue.  <i>Albright</i>, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 271.  After pinpointing that right, courts still must determine the elements of, and rules associated with, an action seeking damages for its violation.  See, <i>e.g., Carey</i> v. <i>Piphus</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247\n\xe2\x80\x93258 (1978).  Here, the parties particularly disagree over the accrual date of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim\xe2\x80\x94that is, the date on which the applicable two-year statute of limitations began to run.  The timeliness of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s suit hinges on the choice between their proposed dates.  But with the following brief comments, we remand that issue to the court below.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In defining the contours and prerequisites of a \xc2\xa71983 claim, including its rule of accrual, courts are to look first to the common law of torts.  See <i>ibid. </i>(explaining that tort principles \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the appropriate starting point\xe2\x80\x9d in specifying the conditions for recovery under \xc2\xa71983);<i> Wallace</i> v.<i> Kato</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384\n\xe2\x80\x93390 (2007) (same for accrual dates in particular).  Sometimes, that review of common law will lead a court to adopt wholesale the rules that would apply in a suit involving the most analogous tort.  See <i>id.,</i> at 388\xe2\x80\x93390; <i>Heck</i> v. <i>Humphrey</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477\n\xe2\x80\x93487 (1994).  But not always.  Common-law principles are meant to guide rather than to control the definition of \xc2\xa71983 claims, serving \xe2\x80\x9cmore as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hartman</i> v. <i>Moore</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250,\n258 (2006)\n; see <i>Rehberg </i>v. <i>Paulk</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356,\n366 (2012)\n (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71983 is [not] simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  In applying, selecting among, or adjust-ing common-law approaches, courts must closely attend to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With these precepts as<b> </b>backdrop, Manuel and the City offer competing views about what accrual rule should govern a \xc2\xa71983 suit challenging post-legal-process pretrial detention.  According to Manuel, that\n \nFourth Amendment claim accrues only upon the dismissal of criminal charges\xe2\x80\x94here, on May 4, 2011, less than two years before he brought his suit.  See Reply Brief 2; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24\xe2\x80\x9325, n.\xc2\xa016 (taking the same position).  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s caselaw, Manuel analogizes his claim to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution.  See Reply Brief 9; <i>Wallace, </i>549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389\xe2\x80\x93390.  An element of that tort is the \xe2\x80\x9ctermination of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. proceeding in favor of the accused\xe2\x80\x9d; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.  <i>Heck</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 484, 489.  Man-uel argues that following the same rule in suits like his will avoid \xe2\x80\x9cconflicting resolutions\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71983 litigation and criminal proceedings by \xe2\x80\x9cpreclud[ing] the possibility of the claimant succeeding in the tort action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 484, 486; see Reply Brief 10\xe2\x80\x9311; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24\xe2\x80\x9325, n.\xc2\xa016.  In support of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s position, all but two of the ten Courts of Appeals that have recognized a\n \nFourth Amendment claim like his have incorporated a \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable termination\xe2\x80\x9d element and so pegged the statute of limitations to the dismissal of the criminal case.  See n.\xc2\xa04, <i>supra</i>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  That means in the great majority of Circuits, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim would be timely.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The City, however, contends that any such\n \nFourth Amendment claim accrues (and the limitations period starts to run) on the date of the initiation of legal process\xe2\x80\x94here, on March 18, 2011, <i>more</i> than two years before Manuel filed suit.  See Brief for Respondents 33.  According to the City, the most analogous tort to Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claim is not malicious prosecution but false arrest, which accrues when legal process commences.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47; <i>Wallace, </i>549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389 (noting accrual rule for false arrest suits).  And even if malicious prosecution were the better comparison, the City continues, a court should decline to adopt that tort\xe2\x80\x99s favorable-termination element and associated accrual rule in adjudicating a \xc2\xa71983 claim involving pretrial detention.  That element, the City argues, \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] little sense\xe2\x80\x9d in this context because \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment is concerned not with the outcome of a prosecution, but with the legality of searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 16.  And finally, the City contends that Manuel forfeited an alternative theory for treating his date of release as the date of accrual: to wit, that his pretrial detention \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute[d] a continuing\n \nFourth Amendment violation,\xe2\x80\x9d each day of which triggered the statute of limitations anew.  <i>Id.,</i> at 29, and n.\xc2\xa06; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36; see also <i>Albright</i>, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 280 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (propounding a similar view).  So Manuel, the City concludes, lost the opportunity to recover for his pretrial detention by waiting too long to file suit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We leave consideration of this dispute to the Court of Appeals.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (2005).  Because the Seventh Circuit wrongly held that Manuel lacked any\n \nFourth Amendment claim once legal process began, the court never addressed the elements of, or rules applicable to, such a claim.  And in particular, the court never confronted the accrual issue that the parties contest here.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  On remand, the Court of Appeals should decide that question, unless it finds that the City has previously waived its timeliness argument.  See Reply to Brief in Opposition 1\xe2\x80\x932 (addressing the possibility of waiver); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40\xe2\x80\x9344 (same).  And so too, the court may consider any other still-live issues relating to the contours of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment claim for unlawful pretrial detention.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Because we here review an order dismissing Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s suit, we accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint.

An arrest warrant, after all, is a way of initiating legal process, in which a magistrate finds<b> </b>probable cause that a person committed a crime.  See <i>Wallace</i> v. <i>Kato</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384,\n389 (2007)\n (explaining that the seizure of a person was \xe2\x80\x9cwithout legal process\xe2\x80\x9d because police officers \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have a warrant for his arrest\xe2\x80\x9d); W.

If legal process is the cut-off point for the\n \nFourth Amendment, then someone arrested (as well as later held) under a warrant procured through false testimony would have to look to the Due Process Clause for relief.

And if the Seventh Circuit would reply that arrest warrants are somehow different\xe2\x80\x94that there is legal process and then again there is <i>legal process</i>\xe2\x80\x94the next (and in our view unanswerable) question would be why.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Even the City no longer appears to contest that conclusion.

See <i>post, </i>at 9, n. 4 (opinion of Alito, J.) (raising but \xe2\x80\x9cnot decid[ing] that question\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>post,</i> at 10 (suggesting an answer nonetheless).  The effect of that view would be to cut off Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the date of his grand jury indictment (March 30)\xe2\x80\x94even though that indictment (like the County Court\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause proceeding) was entirely based on false testi-mony and even though Manuel remained in detention for 36 days longer.See n.\xc2\xa02,<i> supra</i>.  Or said otherwise\xe2\x80\x94even though the legal process he received failed to establish the probable cause necessary for his continued confinement.  We can see no principled reason to draw that line.  Nothing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the\n \nFourth Amendment: Whatever its precise form, if the proceeding is tainted\xe2\x80\x94as here, by fabricated evidence\xe2\x80\x94and the result is that probable cause is lacking, then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.  By contrast (and contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <i>post</i>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa03), once a trial has occurred, the\n \nFourth Amendment drops out: A person challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support both a conviction and any ensuing incarceration does so under the Due Process Clause of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.  See <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307,\n318 (1979)\n (invalidating a conviction under the Due Process Clause when \xe2\x80\x9cthe record evidence could [not] reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Louisville</i>,\n\n362 U.\xc2\xa0S. 199,\n204 (1960)\n (striking a conviction under the same provision when \xe2\x80\x9cthe record [wa]s entirely lacking in evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of guilt\xe2\x80\x94such that it could not even establish probable cause).  <i>Gerstein</i> and <i>Albright</i>, as already suggested, both reflected and recognized that constitutional division of labor.

The rest of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s question did indeed express a view as to what would follow from an affirmative answer (\xe2\x80\x9cso as to allow a malicious prosecution claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Ibid.</i>  (And as the dissent notes, the Seventh Circuit recounted that he made the same argument in that court.  See <i>post, </i>at 2, n.\xc2\xa01.)<i> </i>But as to that secondary issue, we think (for all the reasons just stated) that Manuel jumped the gun.  See <i>supra,</i> at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  And contra the dissent, his doing so provides no warrant for our doing so too.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3706131">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x939496</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">ELIJAH MANUEL, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> CITY OF JOLIET, ILLINOIS, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[March 21, 2017]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I join Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a\n \nFourth Amendmentunreasonable-seizure claim.  Justice Alito suggests that a claim for unreasonable seizure based on a warrantless arrest might not accrue until the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst appearance\xe2\x80\x9d under Illinois law (or the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial appearance\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law)\xe2\x80\x94which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest\xe2\x80\x94rather than at the time of the arrest.  See <i>post, </i>at 1, 9 (dissenting opinion); see also <i>Wallace </i>v. <i>Kato</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384 (2007)\n (taking a similar approach).  Which of those events is the correct one for purposes of accrual makes no difference in this case, because both the arrest and the first appearance occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit.

But if the Court means more\xe2\x80\x94specifically, that new\n \nFourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as pretrial detention lasts\xe2\x80\x94the Court stretches the concept of a seizure much too far.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is that it entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide, <i>i.e.</i>, whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the\n \nFourth Amendment.  I would decide that question and hold that the\n \nFourth Amendment cannot house any such claim.  If a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Constitution, it must find some other home, presumably the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The question that was set out in Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari and that we agreed to decide is as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether an individual\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process <i>so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the\n \nFourth Amendment</i>.  This question was raised, but left unanswered, by this Court in <i>Albright </i>v.<i> Oliver</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266 (1994)\n. <i> </i>Since then, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuits have all held that a\n \nFourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim is cognizable through\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 1983\xe2\x80\x9d).  Only the Seventh Circuit holds that a\n \nFourth Amendment Section 1983 malicious prosecution claim is not cognizable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The question\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ca malicious prosecution claim\xe2\x80\x9d was surely no accident.  First, the conflict on the malicious prosecution question was the centerpiece of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s argument in favor of certiorari.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Second, unless Manuel is given the benefit of the unique accrual rule for malicious prosecution claims, his claim is untimely, and he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I would first consider what I take to be the core of the question presented\xe2\x80\x94whether a \xe2\x80\x9cmalicious prosecution claim may be brought under the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ibid.</i>  Manuel asked us to decide that question because it may be critical to his ultimate success in this lawsuit.    Why is that so?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute of limitations for Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim is Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s general statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, see <i>Wallace </i>v.<i> Kato</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384,\n387 (2007)\n, which requires suit to be brought within two years of the accrual of the claim, see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 735, \xc2\xa75/13\xe2\x80\x93202 (West 2010). <i> </i>Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">March 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the required probable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">March 31, 2011: Manuel is indicted by a grand jury.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">April 8, 2011: Manuel is arraigned.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">May 4, 2011: An assistant state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">May 5, 2011: Manuel is released from jail.</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">April 22, 2013: Manuel files his complaint.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim is untimely unless it accrued on or after April 22, 2011.  And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.  A claim of malicious prosecution \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Heck </i>v. <i>Humphrey</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477,\n489 (1994)\n; see<i> </i>3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7653 (1976).  None of the other common-law torts to which Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim might be compared\xe2\x80\x94such as false arrest or false imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94has such an accrual date.  See <i>Wallace</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 397 (holding that a claim for false imprisonment under the\n \nFourth Amendment accrues when \xe2\x80\x9cthe claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, if Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s case is to go forward, it is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s claim should be so treated, the answer to that question\xe2\x80\x94the one that the Court actually agreed to review\xe2\x80\x94is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on the\n \nFourth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThe first inquiry in any \xc2\xa71983 suit,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has explained, is \xe2\x80\x9cto isolate the precise constitutional viola-tion with which [the defendant] is charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Baker </i>v. <i>McCollan</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137,\n140 (1979)\n.  In this case, Manuel charges that he was seized without probable cause in violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  In order to flesh out the elements of this constitutional tort, we must look for \xe2\x80\x9ctort analogies.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Garcia</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 261,\n277 (1985)\n.  Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of that tort.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> To make out a claim for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff generally must show three things: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthat the criminal proceeding was initiated or continued <i>by the defendant</i> without \xe2\x80\x98probable cause,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, P. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 876 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser and Keeton) (emphasis added), (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthat the defendant instituted the proceeding \xe2\x80\x98maliciously,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 882, and (3) that \xe2\x80\x9cthe proceedings have terminated in favor of the accused,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7653(b); see also <i>Heck</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 489.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the\n \nFourth Amendment.  First, the defendants typically named in\n \nFourth Amendment seizure cases\xe2\x80\x94namely, law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x94lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.  See Prosser and Keeton 876.  That authority lies in the hands of prosecutors.  A law enforcement officer, including the officer responsible for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, may testify before a grand jury, at a preliminary examination, see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75/109\xe2\x80\x933(b), 5/109\xe2\x80\x933.1(b) (West 2010), or hearing, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.1, and at trial.  But when that occurs, the officer is simply a witness and is not responsible for \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision to press criminal charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rehberg </i>v.<i> Paulk</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356,\n371 (2012)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, while subjective bad faith, <i>i.e.</i>, malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, it is firmly established that the\n \nFourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.  See <i>Ashcroft </i>v.<i> al-Kidd</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 731,\n736 (2011)\n.  These two standards\xe2\x80\x94one subjective and the other objective\xe2\x80\x94cannot co-exist.  In some instances, importing a malice requirement into the\n \nFourth Amendment would leave culpable conduct unpunished.  An officer could act unreasonably, thereby violating the\n \nFourth Amendment, without even a hint of bad faith.  In other cases, the malice requirement would cast too wide a net.  An officer could harbor intense personal ill will toward an arrestee but still act in an objectively reason-able manner in carrying out an arrest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, malicious prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s favorable-termination element makes no sense when the claim is that a seizure violated the\n \nFourth Amendment.  The\n \nFourth Amendment, after all, prohibits <i>all </i>unreasonable seizures\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether a prosecution is ever brought or how a prosecution ends.  A \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFourth Amendment wrong\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis fully accomplished,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Calandra</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338,\n354 (1974)\n,<i> </i>when an impermissible seizure occurs.  The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our cases concerning\n \nFourth Amendment claims brought under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 prove the point.  For example, we have recognized that there is no favorable-termination element for a\n \nFourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.  See<i> Wallace</i>, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 389\xe2\x80\x93392.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  An arrestee can file such a claim while his prosecution is pending\xe2\x80\x94and, in at least some situations\xe2\x80\x94will need to do so to ensure that the claim is not time barred.  See <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>at 392\xe2\x80\x93395.  By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial\n \nFourth Amendment violations <i>even after a valid conviction</i>.  For example, in <i>Haring </i>v.<i> Prosise</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306,\n308 (1983)\n, the respondent pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any\n \nFourth Amendment issues.  He then brought a \xc2\xa71983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.  The Court held that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit could proceed\xe2\x80\x94despite his valid conviction.  <i>Id.</i>, at 323; see also<i> Heck</i>, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487, n. 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence that was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s still-outstanding conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The favorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s.  Manuel alleges that he was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.  In such a case, it makes no difference whether the prosecution was eventually able to gather and introduce legitimate evidence and to obtain a conviction at trial.  The unlawful arrest and detention would still provide grounds for recovery.  Accordingly, there is no good reason why the accrual of a claim like Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s should have to await a favorable termination of the prosecution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt \xe2\x80\x9ctort analog[y],\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Wilson</i>, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 277, for\n \nFourth Amendment violations.  So the answer to the question presented in Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition is that the\n \nFourth Amendment does <i>not </i>give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s suit is untimely.  I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.  The Court purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see <i>ante</i>, at 10, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment.  And if that is so, it would seem to follow that new\n \nFourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">That proposition\xe2\x80\x94that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d applies most directly to the act of taking a person into custody or otherwise depriving the person of liberty.  It is not generally used to refer to a prolonged detention.  Dictionary definitions from around the time of the adoption of the\n \nFourth Amendment define the term \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d as a single event\xe2\x80\x94and not a continuing condition.  See,<i> e.g.</i>,<i> </i>2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 67 (1828) (Webster) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of laying hold on suddenly\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1785) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of taking forcible possession\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 T. Dyche &amp; W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (14th ed. 1771) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cseize\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto lay or take hold of violently or at unawares, wrongfully, or by force\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court has explained before, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom the time of the founding to the present, the word \xe2\x80\x98seizure\xe2\x80\x99 has meant a \xe2\x80\x98taking possession.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>California </i>v.<i> Hodari D.</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 621,\n624 (1991)\n (quoting 2 Webster 67).  And we have cautioned against \xe2\x80\x9cstretch[ing] the\n \nFourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 627.  The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as \xe2\x80\x9cdetention\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconfinement,\xe2\x80\x9d if a\n \nFourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, a period of detention spanning weeks or months cannot be viewed as one long, continuing seizure, and a pretrial detainee is not \xe2\x80\x9cseized\xe2\x80\x9d over and over again as long as he remains in custody.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Of course, the damages resulting from an unlawful seizure may continue to mount during the period of confinement caused by the seizure, but no new\n \nFourth Amendment seizure claims accrue after that date.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Thus, any possible\n \nFourth Amendment claim that Manuel could bring is time barred.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court is mistaken in saying that its decision \xe2\x80\x9cfollows from settled precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.  The Court reads <i>Albright </i>v. <i>Oliver</i>,\n\n510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266 (1994)\n,<i> </i>and <i>Gerstein </i>v.<i> Pugh</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103 (1975)\n,<i> </i>to mean<i> </i>that the\n \nFourth Amendment can be violated \xe2\x80\x9cwhen legal process itself goes wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 9, but the accuracy of that interpretation depends on the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9clegal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading is correct if by \xe2\x80\x9clegal process\xe2\x80\x9d the Court means a determination of probable cause at a first or initial appearance.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \xc2\xa75/109\xe2\x80\x931 (West Supp. 2015); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(b).  When an arrest warrant is obtained, the probable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at the first or initial appearance.  But when an arrest is made without a warrant, the arrestee, generally within 48 hours, must be brought before a judicial officer, <i>County of Riverside </i>v.<i> McLaughlin</i>,\n\n500 U. S. 44,\n56 (1991)\n, who then completes the arrest process by making the same determination that would have been made as part of the warrant application process.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75/109\xe2\x80\x931(a), (b); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4(a), 5(b).  Thus, this appearance is an integral part of the process of taking the arrestee into custody and easily falls within the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cseizure.\xe2\x80\x9d  But other forms of \xe2\x80\x9clegal process,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cseizure,\xe2\x80\x9d and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take <i>Albright </i>first.  A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a \xe2\x80\x9clook-alike\xe2\x80\x9d substance.  See <i>Albright</i> v. <i>Oliver</i>, 975 F.\xc2\xa02d 343, 344 (CA7 1992).  The warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of the substance.  <i>Ibid</i>.  After learning of the warrant, Albright turned himself in, was booked, and was released on bond.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Oliver testified at what Illinois calls a preliminary examination and apparently related the information provided by the alleged purchaser.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The judge found probable cause, but the charges were later dismissed.  <i>Ibid. </i> According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking, <i>id</i>., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.  All that this Court held was that Albright\xe2\x80\x99s claim had to be analyzed under the\n \nFourth Amendment, not substantive due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court now reads <i>Albright</i> to mean that a\n \nFourth Amendment seizure continues \xe2\x80\x9cafter the start of \xe2\x80\x98legal process,\xe2\x80\x9d but three forms of what might be termed \xe2\x80\x9clegal process\xe2\x80\x9d were issued in <i>Albright</i>: the arrest warrant, the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance, and the order holding him over for trial after the preliminary examination.  I agree that Albright\xe2\x80\x99s seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant (that would be ridiculous since he had not even been arrested at that point) or the first appearance, see <i>ante</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and n. 6, but it is impossible to read anything more into the holding in <i>Albright</i>.  The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined the plurality opinion, referred only to Albright\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carrest,\xe2\x80\x9d 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 275 (concurring opinion); and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in the judgment, did so only because Albright\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9callegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 281 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).  To read anything more into <i>Albright</i> is to adopt the position taken by just one Member of the plurality, see <i>id</i>., at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (seizure continues throughout the period of pretrial detention), and the two Justices in dissent, see <i>id</i>., at 307 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The other precedent on which the Court relies, <i>Gerstein</i>, goes no further than <i>Albright</i>.  All that the Court held in <i>Gerstein</i> was that <i>if</i> there is no probable-cause finding by a neutral magistrate <i>before</i> an arrest, there must be one <i>after </i>the arrest.  420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93116.  The Court reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 114.  The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the\n \nFourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta\xe2\x80\x94taken out of context\xe2\x80\x94from <i>Gerstein</i>.  For example, the Court cites <i>Gerstein</i>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it \xe2\x80\x9calways has been thought to define the \xe2\x80\x98process that is due\xe2\x80\x99 for seizures of person[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 125, n. 27.  This statement hardly shows that a\n \nFourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in <i>Gerstein</i>\xe2\x80\x94which suggests that the\n \nFourth Amendment might govern \xe2\x80\x9conly the first stage\xe2\x80\x9d of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our \xe2\x80\x9celaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis deleted).<i> </i> In the end, <i>Gerstein</i> stands for the proposition that the\n \nFourth Amendment requires a post-arrest probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate; it says nothing about whether the\n \nFourth Amendment extends beyond that or any other \xe2\x80\x9clegal process.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A well-known medical maxim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfirst, do no harm\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a good rule of thumb for courts as well.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today violates that rule by avoiding the question presented in order to reach an unnecessary and tricky issue.  The resulting opinion will, I fear, inject much confusion into\n \nFourth Amendment law.  And it has the potential to do much harm\xe2\x80\x94by dramatically expanding\n \nFourth Amendment liability under \xc2\xa71983 in a way that does violence to the text of the\n \nFourth Amendment.

That is flatly wrong.  As the Seventh Circuit acknowledged, its decision in this case and an earlier case on which the decision here relied, <i>Newsome </i>v.<i> McCabe</i>, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 747 (2001), conflict with decisions of other circuits holding that a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the\n \nFourth Amendment.  The decision below states: \xe2\x80\x9cManuel argues that we should reconsider our holding in <i>Newsome</i> and recognize a federal claim for malicious prosecution under the\n \nFourth Amendment regardless of the available state remedy.  By his count, 10 other Circuits have recognized federal malicious-prosecution claims under the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  590 Fed. Appx. 641, 643 (2015).

The Court writes that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11, n. 8.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the proceeding is tainted\xe2\x80\x94as here, by fabricated evidence\xe2\x80\x94and the result is that probable cause is lacking,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court continues, \xe2\x80\x9cthen the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Although the Court inserts the word \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial\xe2\x80\x9d in this sentence, its logic provides no reason for that limitation.  If a\n \nFourth Amendment seizure continues as long as a person is detained, there is no reason why incarceration after conviction cannot be regarded as a continuing seizure.  The Court asserts that the\n \nFourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cdrops out of the picture\xe2\x80\x9d after trial, <i>ibid.</i>, but it does not explain why this is so.  There are facilities that house both pretrial detainees and prisoners serving sentences.  If a detainee is transferred following conviction from the section for detainees to the section for prisoners, does the transfer render this person \xe2\x80\x9cunseized\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">4</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0There is authority for the proposition that a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause after an adversary proceeding may be an intervening cause that cuts off liability for an unlawful arrest.
