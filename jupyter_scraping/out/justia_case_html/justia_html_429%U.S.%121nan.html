Morrison, ante</em> p  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/1/case.html">429 U. S. 1</a></span>, and <em>United States v. Rose, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/5/case.html">429 U. S. 5</a></span>.  Respondent\'s car was stopped by Boarder Patrol agents; a search disclosed marihuana.  Respondent lost a motion to suppress and was found guilty after a bench trial.  Following this trial, but before sentencing, the District Court, relying upon our decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/266/case.html">413 U. S. 266</a></span> (1973), dismissed the indictment.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, as it did in <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Rose,</em> found the Government\'s appeal barred by double jeopardy.</p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/case.html">420 U. S. 332</a></span> (1975), we held that double jeopardy would not bar a Government appeal if success on that appeal would result in the reinstatement of a verdict of guilty.  The fact that the dismissal of the indictment here occurred after a general finding of guilt rendered by the court in a bench trial, rather than after a return of a verdict of guilty by a jury, is immaterial.  <em>Morrison, supra.</em>  Double jeopardy therefore does not bar an appeal by the Government.</p>\n<p>We grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand to that court for proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
