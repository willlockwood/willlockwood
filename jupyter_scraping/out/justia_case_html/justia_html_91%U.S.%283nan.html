S. 289</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MILLER, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We differ with the district court as to the construction of the instrument.  We do not think that the state simply bought a wire and batteries and other instruments and became absolute owners of them; on the contrary, we think that the contract was for the use of a wire and instruments of the telegraph company.</p>\n<p>The language of the first covenant of the telegraph company is that it agrees "to set apart on its line of poles along said railroad a telegraph wire for the exclusive use of said party of the second part."  The further covenants are all consistent with this.  The contract for the use of this wire in connection with the others, and for the use of one of the wires already there when this shall be disabled, the fact that it is placed upon the poles of the company already in use for two other wires, the agreements regulating the offices, and, in short, the whole frame of the contract show that the wire, the poles, the instruments, were the property of the telegraph company, with exclusive use of this wire transferred to the railroad.</p>\n<p>This view is perfectly consistent with the idea that the state should pay the cost and expense of the additional wire and instruments rendered necessary by this agreement for its exclusive use, which does not prove that anything more than this right to exclusive use passed to the state.</p>\n<p>If this be true, the railroad company, taking possession of this wire and instrument under claim of right from the state, must use it on the terms which bound the state or not use it at all.</p>\n<p>The ownership being in the telegraph company, the road could only have such use of it lawfully as it acquired from the state, and the right of the state to the use of it is governed by the terms of the agreement. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 91 U. S. 290</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is said that the contract between the state and the telegraph company is void because the superintendent and the governor had no power to make it and because it is oppressive and extortionate.</p>\n<p>We do not decide whether this be so or not.  Whenever the railroad company or the state shall cease to use the wire, shall abandon the contract and leave the instruments severely alone, and the complainant shall then seek to compel compliance with the contract, it will be time to decide that question; but so long as this company, by the use of the wire and the apparatus, gets the benefit of the contract, it must also abide by the terms in other respects.</p>\n<p>We are embarrassed in this view of the subject by the unskillful character of the bill.  The relief it seeks is the very last one would think of -- namely, to enjoin the railroad company from the use of a wire and battery and instruments running along their line, and fixtures in their offices and depots, where they may remain until it be the pleasure of the complainant to take them away.  The right to compensation for what the complainant has suffered by the failure of defendant, while using the wire, to comply with the covenants of the state, can be understood, and the right of defendant, when performing the covenants of the state, to use the wire can be understood; the right to a rescission of the contract if either party prayed therefor can be understood; but this right which each claims, that it shall be let alone by the other to do as it pleases in regard to this wire, is very difficult to understand.</p>\n<p>Complainant, in the petition, treats as revoked the power and privilege of defendant to use the wire and instruments.  Is this an abandonment of the contract by complainant?</p>\n<p>But there is in the bill a prayer for such other and general relief as the case may require.  There is also the following stipulation after the pleadings are all in, which relieves us of much difficulty:</p>\n<p>"It is agreed by counsel that if the use of the wire by the defendant is affected by the contract entered into between the complainant and the state (which contract is copied in the exhibit to the bill) in such manner as that the terms of said contract must be observed and complied with by defendant in order to retain the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 91 U. S. 291</a></p><p> right to such use, the case is one proper for reference to the master to take an account unless the court should adjudge that there is no right in complainant to relief in equity."</p>\n<p>Now we are of opinion that the use of the wire by defendant is affected by the contract between complainant and the state in such manner that such use requires the defendant to comply with the terms of that contract.</p>\n<p>We are also of opinion that to prevent multiplicity of suits and to have an accounting instead of bringing a suit on every specific violation of the covenants of the state, complainant has a right to relief in equity.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the circuit court is therefore reversed with directions to refer the case to a master to state an account on the terms of the contract between the state and the telegraph company, as between the complainant and defendant, for the time defendant has used the wires, batteries, and equipments put up under that contract, and to render a decree for that amount.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
