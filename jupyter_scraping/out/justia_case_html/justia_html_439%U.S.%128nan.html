JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners were convicted of armed robbery in the Circuit Court of Kankakee County, Ill., and their convictions were affirmed on appeal.  At their trial, the prosecution offered into evidence a sawed-off rifle and rifle shells that had been seized by police during a search of an automobile in which petitioners had been passengers.  Neither petitioner is the owner of the automobile, and neither has ever asserted that he owned the rifle or shells seized.  The Illinois Appellate Court held that petitioners lacked standing to object to the allegedly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 439 U. S. 130</a></p><p> unlawful search, and seizure and denied their motion to suppress the evidence.  We granted certiorari in light of the obvious importance of the issues raised to the administration of criminal justice, 435 U.S. 922 (1978), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because we are not here concerned with the issue of probable cause, a brief description of the events leading to the search of the automobile will suffice.  A police officer on a routine patrol received a radio call notifying him of a robbery of a clothing store in Bourbonnais, Ill., and describing the getaway car.  Shortly thereafter, the officer spotted an automobile which he thought might be the getaway car.  After following the car for some time and after the arrival of assistance, he and several other officers stopped the vehicle.  The occupants of the automobile, petitioners and two female companions, were ordered out of the car, and, after the occupants had left the car, two officers searched the interior of the vehicle.  They discovered a box of rifle shells in the glove compartment, which had been locked, and a sawed-off rifle under the front passenger seat.  App. 111.  After discovering the rifle and the shells, the officers took petitioners to the station and placed them under arrest.</p>\n<p>Before trial petitioners moved to suppress the rifle and shells seized from the car on the ground that the search violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  They conceded that they did not own the automobile, and were simply passengers; the owner of the car had been the driver of the vehicle at the time of the search.  Nor did they assert that they owned the rifle or the shells seized. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The prosecutor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 439 U. S. 131</a></p><p> challenged petitioners\' standing to object to the lawfulness of the search of the car because neither the car, the shells nor the rifle belonged to them.  The trial court agreed that petitioners lacked standing, and denied the motion to suppress the evidence.  App. 224.  In view of this holding, the court did not determine whether there was probable cause for the search and seizure.  On appeal after petitioners\' conviction, the Appellate Court of Illinois, Third Judicial District, affirmed the trial court\'s denial of petitioners\' motion to suppress because it held that,</p>\n<p>"without a proprietary or other similar interest in an automobile, a mere passenger therein lacks standing to challenge the legality of the search of the vehicle.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 439 U. S. 132</a></p><p> 46 Ill.App.3d 569, 571, 360 N.E.2d 1252, 1253 (1977).  The court stated:"</p>\n<p>"We believe that defendants failed to establish any prejudice to their own constitutional rights, because they were not persons aggrieved by the unlawful search and seizure. . . .  They wrongly seek to establish prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search and seizure directed at someone else, and fail to prove an invasion of their own privacy.  <em>Alderman v. United States</em> (1969), <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span>. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 571-572, 360 N.E.2d at 1254.  The Illinois Supreme Court denied petitioners leave to appeal.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners first urge us to relax or broaden the rule of standing enunciated in <em>Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html">362 U. S. 257</a></span> (1960), so that any criminal defendant at whom a search was "directed" would have standing to contest the legality of that search and object to the admission at trial of evidence obtained as a result of the search.  Alternatively, petitioners argue that they have standing to object to the search under <em>Jones</em> because they were "legitimately on [the] premises" at the time of the search.</p>\n<p>The concept of standing discussed in <em>Jones</em> focuses on whether the person seeking to challenge the legality of a search as a basis for suppressing evidence was himself the "victim" of the search or seizure.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#261">362 U. S. 261</a></span>. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Adoption of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 439 U. S. 133</a></p><p> the so-called "target" theory advanced by petitioners would, in effect, permit a defendant to assert that a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of a third party entitled him to have evidence suppressed at his trial.  If we reject petitioners\' request for a broadened rule of standing such as this, and reaffirm the holding of <em>Jones</em> and other cases that Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously, we will have occasion to reexamine the "standing" terminology emphasized in <em>Jones.</em>  For we are not at all sure that the determination of a motion to suppress is materially aided by labeling the inquiry identified in <em>Jones</em> as one of standing, rather than simply recognizing it as one involving the substantive question of whether or not the proponent of the motion to suppress has had his own Fourth Amendment rights infringed by the search and seizure which he seeks to challenge.  We shall therefore consider, in turn, petitioners\' target theory, the necessity for continued adherence to the notion of standing discussed in <em>Jones</em> as a concept that is theoretically distinct from the merits of a defendant\'s Fourth Amendment claim, and, finally, the proper disposition of petitioners\' ultimate claim in this case.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We decline to extend the rule of standing in Fourth Amendment cases in the manner suggested by petitioners.

To the extent that the language might be read more broadly, it is dictum which was impliedly repudiated in <em>Alderman v. United States, supra,</em> and which we now expressly reject.  In <em>Jones,</em> the Court set forth two alternative holdings:  it established a rule of "automatic" standing to contest an allegedly illegal search where the same possession needed to establish standing is an essential element of the offense charged, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and, second, it stated that "anyone legitimately on premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality by way of a motion to suppress."  362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#264">362 U.

Relevant and reliable evidence is kept from the trier of fact and the search for truth at trial is deflected.  <em>See United States v.

Since our cases generally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 439 U. S. 138</a></p><p> have held that one whose Fourth Amendment rights are violated may successfully suppress evidence obtained in the course of an illegal search and seizure, misgivings as to the benefit of enlarging the class of persons who may invoke that rule are properly considered when deciding whether to expand standing to assert Fourth Amendment violations. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Had we accepted petitioners\' request to allow persons other than those whose own Fourth Amendment rights were violated by a challenged search and seizure to suppress evidence obtained in the course of such police activity, it would be appropriate to retain <em>Jones\'</em> use of standing in Fourth Amendment analysis.  Under petitioners\' target theory, a court could determine that a defendant had standing to invoke the exclusionary rule without having to inquire into the substantive question of whether the challenged search or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment rights of that particular defendant.  However, having rejected petitioners\' target theory and reaffirmed the principle that the</p>\n<p>"rights assured by the Fourth Amendment are personal rights, [which] . . . may be enforced by exclusion of evidence only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure,"</p>\n<p><em>Simmons v. United States,</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/377/case.html#389">390 U.

S. 139</a></p><p> Amendment claim.  We can think of no decided cases of this Court that would have come out differently had we concluded, as we do now, that the type of standing requirement discussed in <em>Jones</em> and reaffirmed today is more properly subsumed under substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine.  Rigorous application of the principle that the rights secured by this Amendment are personal, in place of a notion of "standing," will produce no additional situations in which evidence must be excluded.  The inquiry under either approach is the same. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But we think the better analysis forthrightly focuses on the extent of a particular defendant\'s rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined, concept of standing.  The Court in <em>Jones</em> also may have been aware that there was a certain artificiality in analyzing this question in terms of standing, because, in at least three separate places in its opinion, the Court placed that term within quotation marks.  362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#261">362 U.

But this Court\'s long history of insistence that Fourth Amendment rights are personal in nature has already answered many of these traditional standing inquiries, and we think that definition of those rights is more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.  <em>Cf. id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html#153">397 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Analyzed in these terms, the question is whether the challenged search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment rights of a criminal defendant who seeks to exclude the evidence obtained during it.  That inquiry, in turn, requires a determination of whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.  We are under no illusion that, by dispensing with the rubric of standing used in <em>Jones,</em> we have rendered any simpler the determination of whether the proponent of a motion to suppress is entitled to contest the legality of a search and seizure.  But by frankly recognizing that this aspect of the analysis belongs more properly under the heading of substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine than under the heading of standing, we think the decision of this issue will rest on sounder logical footing.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Here, petitioners, who were passengers occupying a car which they neither owned nor leased, seek to analogize their position to that of the defendant in <em>Jones v. Unite States.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 439 U. S. 141</a></p><p> In <em>Jones,</em> petitioner was present at the time of the search of an apartment which was owned by a friend.  The friend had given Jones permission to use the apartment and a key to it, with which Jones had admitted himself on the day of the search.  He had a suit and shirt at the apartment, and had slept there "maybe a night," but his home was elsewhere.  At the time of the search, Jones was the only occupant of the apartment, because the lessee was away for a period of several days.  362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#259">362 U. S. 259</a></span>.  Under these circumstances, this Court stated that, while one wrongfully on the premises could not move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of searching them, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] "anyone legitimately on premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#267">362 U. S. 267</a></span>.  Petitioners argue that their occupancy of the automobile in question was comparable to that of <em>Jones</em> in the apartment, and that they therefore have standing to contest the legality of the search -- or, as we have rephrased the inquiry, that they, like <em>Jones,</em> had their Fourth Amendment rights violated by the search.</p>\n<p>We do not question the conclusion in <em>Jones</em> that the defendant in that case suffered a violation of his personal Fourth Amendment rights if the search in question was unlawful.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 439 U. S. 142</a></p><p> Nonetheless, we believe that the phrase "legitimately on premises" coined in <em>Jones</em> creates too broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth Amendment right. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  For example, applied literally, this statement would permit a casual visitor who has never seen, or been permitted to visit, the basement of another\'s house to object to a search of the basement if the visitor happened to be in the kitchen of the house at the time of the search.  Likewise, a casual visitor who walks into a house one minute before a search of the house commences and leaves one minute after the search ends would be able to contest the legality of the search.  The first visitor would have absolutely no interest or legitimate expectation of privacy in the basement, the second would have none in the house, and it advances no purpose served by the Fourth Amendment to permit either of them to object to the lawfulness of the search. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>We think that <em>Jones,</em> on its facts, merely stands for the unremarkable proposition that a person can have a legally sufficient interest in a place other than his own home so that the Fourth Amendment protects him from unreasonable governmental intrusion into that place.  <em>See</em> 362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#263">362 U.

In defining the scope of that interest, we adhere to the view expressed in <em>Jones</em> and echoed in later cases that arcane distinctions developed in property and tort law between guests, licensees, invitees, and the like, ought not to control.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#266">362 U.

But the <em>Jones</em> statement that a person need only be "legitimately on premises" in order to challenge the validity of the search of a dwelling place cannot be taken in its full sweep beyond the facts of that case.</p>\n<p><em>Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span> (1967), provides guidance in defining the scope of the interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.  In the course of repudiating the doctrine derived from <em>Olmstead v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html">277 U. S. 438</a></span> (1928), and <em>Goldman v.

S. 129</a></span> (1942), that, if police officers had not been guilty of a common law trespass, they were not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment from eavesdropping, the Court in <em>Katz</em> held that capacity to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place, but upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.  389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#353">389 U.

S. 752</a></span> (1971). Viewed in this manner, the holding in <em>Jones</em> can best be explained by the fact that Jones had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises he was using, and therefore could claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment with respect to a governmental invasion of those premises even though his "interest" in those premises might not have been a recognized property interest at common law. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>See Jones v. United States,</em> 362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#261">362 U.

S. 144</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Our Brother WHITE, in dissent, expresses the view that, by rejecting the phrase "legitimately on [the] premises" as the appropriate measure of Fourth Amendment rights, we are abandoning a thoroughly workable, "bright line" test in favor of a less certain analysis of whether the facts of a particular case give rise to a legitimate expectation of privacy.  <em>Post</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 439 U. S. 145</a></p><p> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#168">439 U. S. 168</a></span>.  If "legitimately on premises" were the successful litmus test of Fourth Amendment rights that he assumes it is, his approach would have at least the merit of easy application, whatever it lacked in fidelity to the history and purposes of the Fourth Amendment.  But a reading of lower court cases that have applied the phrase "legitimately on premises," and of the dissent itself, reveals that this expression is not a shorthand summary for a bright-line rule which somehow encapsulates the "core" of the Fourth Amendment\'s protections. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 439 U. S. 146</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The dissent itself shows that the facile consistency it is striving for is illusory.  The dissenters concede that "there comes a point when use of an area is shared with so many that one simply cannot reasonably expect seclusion."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#164">439 U. S. 164</a></span>.  But surely the "point" referred to is not one demarcating a line which is black on one side and white on another; it is inevitably a point which separates one shade of gray from another.  We are likewise told by the dissent that a person</p>\n<p>"legitimately on <em>private</em> premises . . . , though his privacy is <em>not absolute,</em> is entitled to expect that he is sharing it only with those persons [allowed there], and that governmental officials will intrude only with <em>consent</em> or by complying with the Fourth Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  This single sentence describing the contours of the supposedly easily applied rule virtually abounds with unanswered questions:  what are "private" premises?  Indeed, what are the "premises?"  It may be easy to describe the "premises" when one is confronted with a 1-room apartment, but what of the case of a 10-room house, or of a house with an attached garage that is searched?  Also, if one\'s privacy is not absolute, how is it bounded?  If he risks governmental intrusion "with consent," who may give that consent?</p>\n<p>Again, we are told by the dissent that the Fourth Amendment assures that "<em>some</em> expectations of privacy are justified, and will be protected from official intrusion."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#166">439 U. S. 166</a></span> (emphasis added).  But we are not told which of many possible expectations of privacy are embraced within this sentence.  And our dissenting Brethren concede that "perhaps the Constitution provides some degree less protection for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 439 U. S. 147</a></p><p> personal freedom from unreasonable governmental intrusion when one does not have a possessory interest in the invaded private place."  <em>Ibid.</em>  But how much "less" protection is available when one does not have such a possessory interest?</p>\n<p>Our disagreement with the dissent is not that it leaves these questions unanswered, or that the questions are necessarily irrelevant in the context of the analysis contained in this opinion.  Our disagreement is rather with the dissent\'s bland and self-refuting assumption that there will not be fine lines to be drawn in Fourth Amendment cases as in other areas of the law, and that its rubric, rather than a meaningful exegesis of Fourth Amendment doctrine, is more desirable or more easily resolves Fourth Amendment cases. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In abandoning "legitimately on premises" for the doctrine that we announce today, we are not forsaking a time-tested and workable rule, which has produced consistent results when applied, solely for the sake of fidelity to the values underlying the Fourth Amendment.  Rather, we are rejecting blind adherence to a phrase which, at most, has superficial clarity, and which conceals underneath that thin veneer all of the problems of line drawing which must be faced in any conscientious effort to apply the Fourth Amendment.  Where the factual premises for a rule are so generally prevalent that little would be lost and much would be gained by abandoning case-by-case analysis, we have not hesitated to do so.  <em>See United States v. Robinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/218/case.html">414 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/218/case.html#235">414 U. S. 235</a></span> (1973).  But the phrase "legitimately </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 439 U. S. 148</a></p><p> on premises" has not been shown to be an easily applicable measure of Fourth Amendment rights so much as it has proved to be simply a label placed by the courts on results which have not been subjected to careful analysis.  We would not wish to be understood as saying that legitimate presence on the premises is irrelevant to one\'s expectation of privacy, but it cannot be deemed controlling.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>Judged by the foregoing analysis, petitioners\' claims must fail.  They asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile nor an interest in the property seized.  And as we have previously indicated, the fact that they were "legitimately on [the] premises" in the sense that they were in the car with the permission of its owner is not determinative of whether they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the particular areas of the automobile searched.  It is unnecessary for us to decide here whether the same expectations of privacy are warranted in a car as would be justified in a dwelling place in analogous circumstances.  We have on numerous occasions pointed out that cars are not to be treated identically with houses or apartments for Fourth Amendment purposes.  <em>See United States v. Chadwick,</em> 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#12">433 U. S. 12</a></span>; <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  But here petitioners\' claim is one which would fail even in an analogous situation in a dwelling place, since they made no showing that they had any legitimate expectation of privacy in the glove compartment or area under the seat of the car in which they were merely passengers.  Like the trunk of an automobile, these are areas in which a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 439 U.

Except with respect to his friend, <em>Jones</em> had complete dominion and control over the apartment, and could exclude others from it.  Likewise, in <em>Katz,</em> the defendant occupied the telephone booth, shut the door behind him to exclude all others, and paid the toll, which "entitled [him] to assume that the words he utter[ed] into the mouthpiece [would] not be broadcast to the world."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#352">389 U.

The prosecutor argued that petitioners lacked standing to challenge the search because they did not own the rifle, the shells or the automobile.  Petitioners did not contest the factual predicates of the prosecutor\'s argument, and, instead, simply stated that they were not required to prove ownership to object to the search.  App. 23.  The prosecutor\'s argument gave petitioners notice that they were to be put to their proof on any issue as to which they had the burden, and, because of their failure to assert ownership, we must assume, for purposes of our review, that petitioners do not own the rifle or the shells.  <em>Combs v. United States, supra,</em> was quite different.  In <em>Combs,</em> the Government had not challenged Combs\' standing at the suppression hearing, and the issue of standing was not raised until the appellate level, where the Government conceded that its warrant was not based on probable cause.  Because the record was "virtually barren of the facts necessary to determine" Combs\' right to contest the search and seizure, the Court remanded the case for further proceedings.  408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/224/case.html#227">408 U.

The Court stated:</p>\n<p>"No just interest of the Government in the effective and rigorous enforcement of the criminal law will be hampered by recognizing that anyone legitimately on premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality by way of a motion to suppress, when its fruits are proposed to be used against him.  <em>This would, of course, not avail those who, by virtue of their wrongful presence, cannot invoke the privacy of the premises searched.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Despite this clear statement in <em>Jones,</em> several lower courts inexplicably have held that a person present in a stolen automobile at the time of a search may object to the lawfulness of the search of the automobile.  <em>See, e.g., Cotton v. United States,</em> 371 F.2d 385 (CA9 1967); <em>Simpson v. United States,</em> 346 F.2d 291 (CA10 1965).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Mancusi v. DeForte, supra,</em> also must have been unsatisfied with the "legitimately on premises" statement in <em>Jones.</em>  DeForte was legitimately in his office at the time of the search, and if the <em>Mancusi</em> Court had literally applied the statement from <em>Jones,</em> DeForte\'s standing to object to the search should have been obvious.  Instead, to determine whether DeForte possessed standing to object to the search, the Court inquired into whether DeForte\'s office was an area "in which there was a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion."  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/364/case.html#368">392 U. S. 368</a></span>; <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/364/case.html#376">392 U. S. 376</a></span> (Black, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with few exceptions, lower courts have literally applied this language from <em>Jones,</em> and have held that anyone legitimately on premises at the time of the search may contest its legality.  <em>See, e.g., Garza-Fuentes v. United States,</em> 400 F.2d 219 (CA5 1968); <em>State v. Bresolin,</em> 13 Wash.App. 386, 534 P.2d 1394 (1975).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>This is not to say that such visitors could not contest the lawfulness of the seizure of evidence or the search if their own property were seized during the search.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Obviously, however, a "legitimate" expectation of privacy. by definition. means more than a subjective expectation of not being discovered.  A burglar plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season may have a thoroughly justified subjective expectation of privacy, but it is not one which the law recognizes as "legitimate."  His presence, in the words of <em>Jones,</em> 362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html#267">362 U. S. 267</a></span>, is "wrongful"; his expectation is not "one that society is prepared to recognize as <em>reasonable.\'"  <em>Katz v. United States,</em> 389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#361">389 U. S. 361</a></span> (Harlan, J., concurring).  And it would, of course, be merely tautological to fall back on the notion that those expectations of privacy which are legitimate depend primarily on cases deciding exclusionary rule issues in criminal cases. Legitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.  One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others, <em>see</em> W. Blackstone, Commentaries, Book 2, ch. 1, and one who owns or lawfully possesses or controls property will, in all likelihood, have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of this right to exclude.  Expectations of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment, of course, need not be based on a common law interest in real or personal property, or on the invasion of such an interest.  These ideas were rejected both in <em>Jones, supra,</em> and <em>Katz, supra.</em>  But, by focusing on legitimate expectations of privacy in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the Court has not altogether abandoned use of property concepts in determining the presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by that Amendment.  No better demonstration of this proposition exists than the decision in <em>Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span> (1969), where the Court held that an individual\'s property interest in his own home was so great as to allow him to object to electronic surveillance of conversations emanating from his home, even though he himself was not a party to the conversations.  On the other hand, even a property interest in premises may not be sufficient to establish a legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to particular items located on the premises or activity conducted thereon.  <em>See Katz, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#351">389 U.

S. 156</a></span>-157.  On the contrary, I read the Court\'s opinion as focusing on whether there was a legitimate expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the police action in stopping the automobile in which they </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 439 U. S. 151</a></p><p> were riding; nor do they complain of being made to get out of the vehicle.  Rather, petitioners assert that their constitutionally protected interest in privacy was violated when the police, after stopping the automobile and making them get out, searched the vehicle\'s interior, where they discovered a sawed-off rifle under the front seat and rifle shells in the locked glove compartment.  The question before the Court, therefore, is a narrow one:  did the search of their friend\'s automobile after they had left it violate any Fourth Amendment right of the petitioners?</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion urges the Court to answer this question by considering only the talisman of legitimate presence on the premises.  To be sure, one of the two alternative reasons given by the Court for its ruling in <em>Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html">362 U. S. 257</a></span> (1960), was that the defendant had been legitimately on the premises searched.  Since <em>Jones,</em> however, the view that mere legitimate presence is enough to create a Fourth Amendment right has been questioned.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#147">439 U. S. 147</a></span>. n. 14.  There also has been a signal absence of uniformity in the application of this theory.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#145">439 U. S. 145</a></span>-146, n. 13</p>\n<p>This Court\'s decisions since <em>Jones</em> have emphasized a sounder standard for determining the scope of a person\'s Fourth Amendment rights:  only legitimate expectations of privacy are protected by the Constitution.  In <em>Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span> (1967), the Court rejected the notion that the Fourth Amendment protects places or property, ruling that the scope of the Amendment must be determined by the scope of privacy that a free people legitimately may expect.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#353">389 U. S. 353</a></span>.  As Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in his concurrence, however, it is not enough that an individual desired or anticipated that he would be free from governmental intrusion.  Rather, for an expectation to deserve the protection of the Fourth Amendment, it must "be one that society is prepared to recognize as <em>reasonable.\'"  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#361">389 U. S. 361</a></span>. </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 439 U. S. 152</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The ultimate question, therefore, is whether one\'s claim to privacy from government intrusion is reasonable in light of all the surrounding circumstances.  As the dissenting opinion states, this standard "will not provide law enforcement officials with a bright line between the protected and the unprotected."  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#168">439 U. S. 168</a></span>.  Whatever the application of this standard may lack in ready administration, it is more faithful to the purposes of the Fourth Amendment than a test focusing solely or primarily on whether the defendant was legitimately present during the search. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In considering the reasonableness of asserted privacy expectations, the Court has recognized that no single factor invariably will be determinative.  Thus, the Court has examined whether a person invoking the protection of the Fourth Amendment took normal precautions to maintain his privacy -- that is, precautions customarily taken by those seeking privacy.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chadwick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html">433 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#11">433 U. S. 11</a></span> (1977) ("By placing personal effects inside a double-locked </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 439 U. S. 153</a></p><p> footlocker, respondents manifested an expectation that the contents would remain free from public examination"); <em>Katz v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#352">389 U. S. 352</a></span> ("One who occupies [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world").  Similarly, the Court has looked to the way a person has used a location, to determine whether the Fourth Amendment should protect his expectations of privacy.  In <em>Jones v. United States, supra,</em> for example, the Court found that the defendant had a Fourth Amendment privacy interest in an apartment in which he had slept and in which he kept his clothing.  The Court on occasion also has looked to history to discern whether certain types of government intrusion were perceived to be objectionable by the Framers of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See United States v. Chadwick, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#7">433 U. S. 7</a></span>-9.  And, as the Court states today, property rights reflect society\'s explicit recognition of a person\'s authority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and therefore should be considered in determining whether an individual\'s expectations of privacy are reasonable.  <em>See Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span> (1969).</p>\n<p>The Court correctly points out that petitioners cannot invoke decisions such as <em>Alderman</em> in support of their Fourth Amendment claim, as they had no property interest in the automobile in which they were riding.  But this determination is only part of the inquiry required under <em>Katz.</em>  The petitioners\' Fourth Amendment rights were not abridged here, because none of the factors relied upon by this Court on prior occasions supports petitioners\' claim that their alleged expectation of privacy from government intrusion was reasonable.</p>\n<p>We are concerned here with an automobile search.  Nothing is better established in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence than the distinction between one\'s expectation of privacy in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="154">Page 439 U. S. 154</a></p><p> an automobile and one\'s expectation when in other locations. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  We have repeatedly recognized that this expectation in "an automobile . . . [is] significantly different from the traditional expectation of privacy and freedom in one\'s residence."  <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html">428 U. S. 543</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html#561">428 U. S. 561</a></span> (1976).  In <em>United States v. Chadwick, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#12">433 U.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]"</p>\n<p>In <em>Chadwick,</em> the Court recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to one\'s locked footlocker, and rejected the Government\'s argument that luggage always should be equated with motor vehicles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#13">433 U. S. 13</a></span>.</p>\n<p>A distinction also properly may be made in some circumstances between the Fourth Amendment rights of passengers and the right of an individual who has exclusive control of an automobile or of its locked compartments.  In South Dakota v. Opperman,<em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html">428 U. S. 364</a></span> (1976), for example, we </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 439 U. S. 155</a></em></p><p><em> considered "the citizen\'s interest in the privacy of the contents of his automobile" where its doors were locked and windows rolled up.  </em>See id.<em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#379">428 U. S. 379</a></span> (POWELL J., concurring).  Here, there were three passengers and a driver in the automobile searched.  None of the passengers is said to have had control of the vehicle or the keys.  It is unrealistic -- as the shared experience of us all bears witness -- to suggest that these passengers had any reasonable expectation that the car in which they had been riding would not be searched after they were lawfully stopped and made to get out.  The minimal privacy that existed simply is not comparable to that, for example, of an individual in his place of abode, </em>see Jones<em> v. United States, supra;</em> of one who secludes himself in  telephone booth, <em>Katz v. United States, supra;</em> or of the traveler who secures his belongings in a locked suitcase or footlocker.  <em>See United States v. Chadwick, supra.</em> [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>This is not an area of the law in which any "bright line" rule would safeguard both Fourth Amendment rights and the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 439 U. S. 156</a></p><p> public interest in a fair and effective criminal Justice system.  The range of variables in the fact situations of search and seizure is almost infinite.  Rather than seek facile solutions, it is best to apply principles broadly faithful to Fourth Amendment purposes.  I believe the Court has identified these principles. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Allowing anyone who is legitimately on the premises searched to invoke the exclusionary rule extends the rule far beyond the proper scope of Fourth Amendment protections, as not all who are legitimately present invariably have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  And, as the Court points out, the dissenters\' standard lacks even the advantage of easy application.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#145">439 U. S. 145</a></span>-146.</p>\n<p>I do not share the dissenters\' concern that the Court\'s ruling will "invit[e] police to engage in patently unreasonable searches every time an automobile contains more than one occupant."  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#168">439 U. S. 168</a></span>.  A police officer observing an automobile carrying several passengers will not know the circumstances surrounding each occupant\'s presence in the automobile, and certainly will not know whether an occupant will be able to establish that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Thus, there will continue to be a significant incentive for the police to comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, lest otherwise valid prosecutions be voided.  Moreover, any marginal diminution in this incentive that might result from the Court\'s decision today is more than justified by society\'s interest in restricting the scope of the exclusionary rule to those cases where in fact there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>There are sound reasons for this distinction:  automobiles operate on public streets; they are serviced in public places; they stop frequently; they are usually parked in public places; their interiors are highly visible; and they are subject to extensive regulation and inspection.  The rationale of the automobile distinction does not apply, of course, to objects on the person of an occupant.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Six Members of the Court joined THE CHIEF JUSTICE in <em>Chadwick,</em> and the two Justices who dissented in <em>Chadwick</em> did not disagree with the automobile distinction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The sawed-off rifle in this case was merely pushed beneath the front seat, presumably by one of the petitioners.  In that position, it could have slipped into full or partial view in the event of an accident, or indeed upon any sudden stop.  As the rifle shells were in the locked glove compartment, this might have presented a closer case if it had been shown that one of the petitioners possessed the keys or if a rifle had not been found in the automobile.</p>\n<p>The dissenting opinion suggests that the petitioners here took the same actions to preserve their privacy as did the defendant in <em>Katz:</em>  just as Katz closed the door to the telephone booth after him, petitioners closed the doors to their automobile.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#165">439 U. S. 165</a></span> n. 15.  Last Term, this Court determined in <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/106/case.html">434 U. S. 106</a></span> (1977), that passengers in automobiles have no Fourth Amendment right not to be ordered from their vehicle once a proper stop is made.  The dissenting opinion concedes that there is no question here of the propriety of the stopping of the automobile in which the petitioners were riding.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#160">439 U. S. 160</a></span> n. 5.  Thus, the closing of the doors of a vehicle, even if there were only one occupant, cannot have the same significance as it might in other contexts.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if one agreed with my dissenting Brethren that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in this case, the evidence seized would have been admissible under the modification of the exclusionary rule proposed by MR. JUSTICE WHITE in his dissenting opinion in <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#538">428 U. S. 538</a></span> (1976):</p>\n<p>"[T]he rule should be substantially modified so as to prevent its application in those many circumstances where the evidence at issue was seized by an officer acting in the good faith belief that his conduct comported with existing law and having reasonable grounds for this belief.  These are recurring situations; and recurringly evidence is excluded without any realistic expectation that its exclusion will contribute in the slightest to the purposes of the rule, even though the trial will be seriously affected or the indictment dismissed."</p>\n<p><em>See also Brown v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/590/case.html">422 U. S. 590</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/590/case.html#609">422 U. S. 609</a></span>-610 (1975) (POWELL, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today holds that the Fourth Amendment protects property, not people, and specifically that a legitimate occupant of an automobile may not invoke the exclusionary rule and challenge a search of that vehicle unless he happens to own or have a possessory interest in it. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  Though professing to acknowledge that the primary purpose of the Fourth Amendment\'s prohibition of unreasonable searches is the protection of privacy -- not property -- the Court nonetheless effectively ties the application of the Fourth Amendment and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 439 U. S. 157</a></p><p> the exclusionary rule in this situation to property law concepts.  Insofar as passengers are concerned, the Court\'s opinion today declares an "open season" on automobiles.  However unlawful stopping and searching a car may be, absent a possessory or ownership interest, no "mere" passenger may object, regardless of his relationship to the owner.  Because the majority\'s conclusion has no support in the Court\'s controlling decisions, in the logic of the Fourth Amendment, or in common sense, I must respectfully dissent.  If the Court is troubled by the practical impact of the exclusionary rule, it should face the issue of that rule\'s continued validity squarely, instead of distorting other doctrines in an attempt to reach what are perceived as the correct results in specific cases.  <em>Cf. Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#536">428 U. S. 536</a></span> (1976) (WHITE, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Two intersecting doctrines long established in this Court\'s opinions control here.  The first is the recognition of some cognizable level of privacy in the interior of an automobile.  Though the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy in a vehicle may be somewhat weaker than that in a home, <em>see United States v. Chadwick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html">433 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#12">433 U. S. 12</a></span>-13 (1977),</p>\n<p>"[a] search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy.  To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always has regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Ortiz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/891/case.html">422 U. S. 891</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/891/case.html#896">422 U. S. 896</a></span> (1975) (footnote omitted).  So far, the Court has not strayed from this application of the Fourth Amendment. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The second tenet is that, when a person is legitimately present in a private place, his right to privacy is protected from unreasonable governmental interference even if he does </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 439 U. S. 158</a></p><p> not own the premises.  Just a few years ago, THE CHIEF JUSTICE, for a unanimous Court, wrote that the "[p]resence of the defendant at the search and seizure was held, in <em>Jones,</em> to be a sufficient source of standing in itself."  <em>Brown v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/223/case.html">411 U. S. 223</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/223/case.html#227">411 U.

S. 229</a></span> (one basis for Fourth Amendment protection is presence "on the premises at the time of the contested search and seizure"); <em>Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html">362 U. S. 257</a></span> (1960) (individual legitimately present in friend\'s apartment may object to search of apartment).  <em>Brown</em> was not the first time we had recognized that <em>Jones</em> established the rights of one legitimately in a private area against unreasonable governmental intrusion.  <em>E.g., Combs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/224/case.html">408 U.

The Court in <em>Jones</em> itself was unanimous in this regard, and its holding is not the less binding because it was an alternative one.  <em>See Combs v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/224/case.html#227">408 U. S. 227</a></span> n. 4.</p>\n<p>These two fundamental aspects of Fourth Amendment law demand that petitioners be permitted to challenge the search and seizure of the automobile in this case.  It is of no significance that a car is different for Fourth Amendment purposes from a house, for if there is some protection for the privacy of an automobile, then the only relevant analogy is between a person legitimately in someone else\'s vehicle and a person legitimately in someone else\'s home.  If both strands of the Fourth Amendment doctrine adumbrated above are valid, the Court must reach a different result.  Instead, it chooses to eviscerate the <em>Jones</em> principle, an action in which I am unwilling to participate.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Though we had reserved the very issue over 50 years ago, <em>see Carroll v.

S. 159</a></p><p> is entitled to protection against unreasonable searches occurring in his presence.  In decisions upholding the validity of automobile searches, we have gone directly to the merits even though some of the petitioners did not own or possess the vehicles in question.  <em>E.g., Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/case.html">412 U. S. 218</a></span> (1973) (sole petitioner was not owner; in fact, owner was not in the automobile at all); <em>Chambers v.

S. 364</a></span> (1964), the Court unanimously overturned a search though the single petitioner was not the owner of the automobile.  The Court\'s silence on this issue in light of its actions can only mean that, until now, we, like most lower courts, [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] had assumed that <em>Jones</em> foreclosed the answer now supplied by the majority.  That assumption was perfectly understandable, since all private premises would seem to be the same for the purposes of the analysis set out in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The logic of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence compels the result reached by the above decisions.

[<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  But <em>Jones</em> was foreshadowed by Mr. Justice Jackson\'s remark in 1948 that "even a guest may expect the shelter of the rooftree he is under against criminal intrusion."  <em>McDonald v.

That is exactly what the Court holds in this case; but Mr. Justice Brandeis asserted 50 years ago that more than mere property rights are involved, and the Court\'s opinion in <em>Katz</em> reemphasized that "<em>[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.\'"  389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html#353">389 U.

And if all of those situations are protected, surely a person riding in an automobile next to his friend the owner, or a child or wife with the father or spouse, must have some protection as well.</p>\n<p>The same result is reached by tracing other lines of our Fourth Amendment decisions.  If a nonowner may consent to a search merely because he is a joint user or occupant of a "premises," <em>Frazier v. Cupp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html">394 U. S. 731</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/case.html#740">394 U.

[<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]</p>\n<p>It is true that the Court asserts that it is not limiting the Fourth Amendment bar against unreasonable searches to the protection of property rights, but, in reality, it is doing exactly that. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  Petitioners were in a private place with the permission </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 439 U. S. 165</a></p><p> of the owner, but the Court states that that is not sufficient to establish entitlement to a legitimate expectation of privacy.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#148">439 U. S. 148</a></span>.  But if that is not sufficient, what would be?  We are not told, and it is hard to imagine anything short of a property interest that would satisfy the majority.  Insofar as the Court\'s rationale is concerned, no passenger in an automobile, without an ownership or possessory interest and regardless of his relationship to the owner, may claim Fourth Amendment protection against illegal stops and searches of the automobile in which he is rightfully present.  The Court approves the result in <em>Jones,</em> but it fails to give any explanation why the facts in <em>Jones</em> differ, in a fashion material to the Fourth Amendment, from the facts here. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  More importantly, how is the Court able to avoid answering the question why presence in a private place with the owner\'s permission is insufficient?  If it is</p>\n<p>"tautological to fall back on the notion that those expectations of privacy which are legitimate depend primarily on cases deciding exclusionary rule issues in criminal cases,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#144">439 U. S. 144</a></span>, n. 12, then it surely must be tautological to decide that issue simply by unadorned fiat. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 439 U. S. 166</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As a control on governmental power, the Fourth Amendment assures that some expectations of privacy are justified, and will be protected from official intrusion.  That should be true in this instance, for if protected zones of privacy can only be purchased or obtained by possession of property, then much of our daily lives will be unshielded from unreasonable governmental prying, and the reach of the Fourth Amendment will have been narrowed to protect chiefly those with possessory interests in real or personal property. I had thought that <em>Katz</em> firmly established that the Fourth Amendment was intended as more than simply a trespass law applicable to the government.  Katz had no possessory interest in the public telephone booth, at least no more than petitioners had in their friend\'s car; Katz was simply legitimately present.  And the decision in <em>Katz</em> was based not on property rights, but on the theory that it was essential to securing "conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness" [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>] that the expectation of privacy in question be recognized. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]</p>\n<p>At most, one could say that perhaps the Constitution provides some degree less protection for the personal freedom from unreasonable governmental intrusion when one does not have a possessory interest in the invaded private place.  But that would only change the extent of the protection; it would not free police to do the unreasonable, as does the decision today.  And since the accused should be entitled to litigate the application of the Fourth Amendment where his privacy interest is merely arguable, [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>] the failure to allow such litigation here is the more incomprehensible. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 439 U. S. 167</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding is contrary not only to our past decisions and the logic of the Fourth Amendment, but also to the everyday expectations of privacy that we all share.  Because of that, it is unworkable in all the various situations that arise in real life.  If the owner of the car had not only invited petitioners to join her but had said to them, "I give you a temporary possessory interest in my vehicle so that you will share the right to privacy that the Supreme Court says that I own," then apparently the majority would reverse.  But people seldom say such things, though they may mean their invitation to encompass them if only they had thought of the problem. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]  If the nonowner were the spouse or child of the owner, [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>] would the Court recognize a sufficient interest?  If so, would distant relatives somehow have more of an expectation of privacy than close friends?  What if the nonowner were driving with the owner\'s permission?  Would nonowning drivers have more of an expectation of privacy than mere passengers?  What about a passenger in a taxicab?  <em>Katz</em> expressly recognized protection for such passengers.  Why should Fourth Amendment rights be present when one pays a cabdriver for a ride, but be absent when one is given a ride by a friend?</p>\n<p>The distinctions the Court would draw are based on relationships between private parties, but the Fourth Amendment is concerned with the relationship of one of those parties to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 439 U. S. 168</a></p><p> the government.  Divorced as it is from the purpose of the Fourth Amendment, the Court\'s essentially property-based rationale can satisfactorily answer none of the questions posed above.  That is reason enough to reject it.  The <em>Jones</em> rule is relatively easily applied by police and courts; the rule announced today will not provide law enforcement officials with a bright line between the protected and the unprotected. [<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]  Only rarely will police know whether one private party has or has not been granted a sufficient possessory or other interest by another private party.  Surely, in this case, the officers had no such knowledge.  The Court\'s rule will ensnare defendants and police in needless litigation over factors that should not be determinative of Fourth Amendment rights. [<a href="#F3/22" name="T3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>]</p>\n<p>More importantly, the ruling today undercuts the force of the exclusionary rule in the one area in which its use is most certainly justified -- the deterrence of bad-faith violations of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See Stone v. Powell,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#536">428 U. S. 536</a></span>-542 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  This decision invites police to engage in patently unreasonable searches every time an automobile contains more than one occupant.  Should something be found, only the owner of the vehicle, or of the item, will have standing to seek suppression, and the evidence will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 439 U. S. 169</a></p><p> presumably be usable against the other occupants. [<a href="#F3/23" name="T3/23">Footnote 3/23</a>]  The danger of such bad faith is especially high in cases such as this one, where the officers are only after the passengers, and can usually infer accurately that the driver is the owner.  The suppression remedy for those owners in whose vehicles something is found and who are charged with crime is small consolation for all those owners and occupants whose privacy will be needlessly invaded by officers following mistaken hunches not rising to the level of probable cause but operated on in the knowledge that someone in a crowded car will probably be unprotected if contraband or incriminating evidence happens to be found.  After this decision, police will have little to lose by unreasonably searching vehicles occupied by more than one person.</p>\n<p>Of course, most police officers will decline the Court\'s invitation, and will continue to do their jobs as best they can in accord with the Fourth Amendment.  But the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to answer the justified fear that governmental agents cannot be left totally to their own devices, and the Bill of Rights is enforceable in the courts because human experience teaches that not all such officials will otherwise adhere to the stated precepts.  Some policemen simply do act in bad faith, even if for understandable ends, and some deterrent is needed.  In the rush to limit the applicability of the exclusionary rule somewhere, anywhere, the Court ignores precedent, logic, and common sense to exclude the rule\'s operation from situations in which, paradoxically, it is justified and needed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>For the most part, I agree with the Court\'s rejection, which was implicit in <em>Alderman v.

What difference should that property interest make to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches, which is concerned with privacy?  <em>See Coolidge v.

S. 443</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/443/case.html#510">403 U. S. 510</a></span>-521 (1971) (WHITE, J., with BURGER, C.J., concurring and dissenting).  Contrary to the Court\'s suggestion, a legitimate passenger in a car expects to enjoy the privacy of the vehicle whether or not he happens to carry some item along for the ride.  We have never before limited our concern for a person\'s privacy to those situations in which he is in possession of personal property.  Even a person living in a barren room without possessions is entitled to expect that the police will not intrude without cause.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/15" name="F3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Jones</em> had permission to use the apartment, had slept in it one night, had a key, had left a suit and a shirt there, and was the only occupant at the time of the search.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#141">439 U.

Petitioners here had permission to be in the car, and were occupying it at the time of the search.  Thus, the only distinguishing fact is that Jones could exclude others from the apartment by using his friend\'s key.  But petitioners and their friend the owner had excluded others by entering the automobile and shutting the doors.  Petitioners did not need a key, because the owner was present.  Similarly, the Court attempts to distinguish <em>Katz</em> on the theory that Katz had "shut the door behind him to exclude all others," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#149">439 U. S. 149</a></span>, but petitioners here did exactly the same.  The car doors remained closed until the police ordered them opened at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/16" name="F3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Olmstead v.

Apparently not contemplating today\'s radical change in the law, petitioners did not know at the suppression hearing that the precise form of the invitation extended by the owner to the petitioners would be dispositive of their rights against governmental intrusion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/20" name="F3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>]</p>\n<p>In fact, though it was not brought out at the suppression hearing, one of the petitioners is the former husband of the owner and driver of the car.

As the discussion, <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/case.html#159">439 U. S. 159</a></span>-166, indicates, this dissent disagrees with the Court\'s view that petitioners lack a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The Court\'s <em>ipse dixit</em> is not only unexplained, but also is unjustified in light of what persons reasonably do, and should be entitled to, expect.  My point in this portion of the opinion is that the Court\'s lack of faithfulness to the purposes of the Fourth Amendment does not have even the saving grace of providing an easily applied rule.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/22" name="F3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>]</p>\n<p>To say that the Fourth Amendment goes beyond property rights, of course, is not to say that one not enjoying privacy in person would not be entitled to expect protection from unreasonable intrusions into the areas he owns, such as his house.  <em>E.g., Alderman v.
