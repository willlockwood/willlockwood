C. \xc2\xa71001 <em>et seq</em>., mandates minimum participation, vesting, and funding schedules for covered pension plans, and establishes fiduciary conduct standards for plan administrators.  Title II, codified in 26 U. S.

Title III, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71201 <em>et seq.</em>, contains provisions designed to coordinate enforcement efforts of different federal departments.  Title IV, 29 U.

This case concerns Title I\xe2\x80\x99s definition and coverage provisions, though those provisions, indicating who may participate in an ERISA-sheltered plan, inform each of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s four titles.  Title I defines \xe2\x80\x9cemployee benefit plan\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or \xe2\x80\xa6 both,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71002(3); \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass \xe2\x80\x9cany employee \xe2\x80\xa6 eligible to receive a benefit \xe2\x80\xa6 from an employee benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71002(7); \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany individual employed by an employer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71002(6); and \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany person acting \xe2\x80\xa6 as an employer, or \xe2\x80\xa6 in the interest of an employer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71002(5).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yates was sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation that maintained a profit sharing plan (Plan).  From the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s inception, at least one person other than Yates or his wife was a Plan participant.  The Plan qualified for favorable tax treatment under IRC \xc2\xa7401.  As required by the IRC, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(a)(13), and ERISA, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71056(d), the Plan contained an anti-alienation provision.  Entitled \xe2\x80\x9cSpendthrift Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the provision stated, in relevant part:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cExcept for \xe2\x80\xa6 loans to Participants as [expressly provided for in the Plan], no benefit or interest available hereunder will be subject to assignment or alienation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 from another of his corporation\xe2\x80\x99s pension plans (which later merged into the Plan), but failed to make any of the required monthly payments.  In November 1996, however, Yates paid off the loan in full with the proceeds of the sale of his house.  Three weeks later, Yates\xe2\x80\x99s creditors filed an involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Respondent Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint against petitioners (the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee), asking the Bankruptcy Court to avoid the loan repayment.  Granting Hendon summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court first determined that the repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7547(b).  That finding was not challenged on appeal.  The Bankruptcy Court then held that the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee, could not rely on the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s anti-alienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the loan repayment for the bankruptcy estate.  That holding was dictated by Sixth Circuit precedent, under which a self-employed owner of a pension plan\xe2\x80\x99s corporate sponsor could not \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA and therefore could not use ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions to enforce the restriction on transfer of his beneficial interest in the plan.  The District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Yates was not a \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d in the Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether, had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The working owner of a business (here, the sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation) may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d in a pension plan covered by ERISA.  If the plan covers one or more employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants.  Such a working owner, in common with other employees, qualifies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants.  Because ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d and, in turn, \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d are uninformative, the Court looks to other ERISA provisions for instruction.  See <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Darden,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/318/index.html">503 U. S. 318</a>, 323.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s multiple textual indications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants provide, in combination, \xe2\x80\x9cspecific guidance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, so there is no cause in this case to resort to common law.  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1974 did not change the existing backdrop of IRC provisions permitting corporate shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.  Rather, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective was to harmonize ERISA with these longstanding tax provisions.  Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit plans.  Most notably, Title I frees certain plans in which working owners likely participate from all of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary responsibility requirements.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a) and 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7414(q)(1)(A) and 416(i)(1)(B)(i).  Title I also contains more limited exemptions from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary responsibility requirements for plans that ordinarily include working owners as participants.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71103(a) and (b)(3)(A) and 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7401(c)(1) and (2)(A)(i), 1402(a) and (c).  Further, Title I contains exemptions from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibited transaction exemptions, which, like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, indicate that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans.  See 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71108(b)(1)(B) and (d)(1) and 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(c)(3).  Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place.  Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative.  For example, Title IV does not apply to plans \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and maintained <em>exclusively</em> for substantial owners,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71321(b)(9) (emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or greater ownership interest, \xc2\xa71322(b)(5)(A).  But Title IV does cover plans in which substantial owners participate <em>along with</em> other employees.  See \xc2\xa71322(b)(5)(B).  Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower courts:\xc2\xa0Under ERISA, a working owner may wear two hats, <em>i.e.,</em> he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at the same time, the employer who established the plan.  See \xc2\xa71301(b)(1) and 26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7401(c)(4).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans is advanced by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The working employer\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity personally to participate and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to the creation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowner employees alike.  Treating the working owner as a participant in an ERISA-sheltered plan also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes: federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner.  Excepting working owners from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is hardly consistent with the statutory goal of \xe2\x80\x9cuniform national treatment of pension benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Shumate,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/753/index.html">504 U. S. 753</a>, 765, and would generate administrative difficulties.  A 1999 Department of Labor advisory opinion (hereinafter Advisory Opinion 99\xe2\x80\x9304A) accords with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension of Title I\xe2\x80\x99s definition and coverage provisions.  Concluding that working owners may qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reflects a \xe2\x80\x9cbody of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court rejects the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 position that a working owner may rank only as an \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d and not also as an \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of ERISA-sheltered plan participation.  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s leading decision in point relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a portion of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR \xc2\xa72510.3\xe2\x80\x933, which states:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98employee benefit plan\xe2\x80\x99 [as used in Title I] shall not include any plan \xe2\x80\xa6 under which no employees are participants\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[f]or purposes of this section,\xe2\x80\x9d </em>\xe2\x80\x9can individual and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to a \xe2\x80\xa6 business\xe2\x80\x9d they own.  (Emphasis added.)  In common with other Courts of Appeals that have held working owners do not qualify as participants in ERISA-governed plans, the Sixth Circuit apparently understood the regulation to provide a generally applicable definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployee,\xe2\x80\x9d controlling for all Title I purposes.  The Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s Advisory Opinion 99\xe2\x80\x9304A, however, interprets the regulation to mean that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee benefit plan\xe2\x80\x9d does not include a plan whose <em>only</em> participants are the owner and his or her spouse, but does include a plan that covers as participants one or more common-law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals.  This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth Circuit, merits the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s respectful consideration.  Cf. <em>Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc., P.\xc2\xa0C.</em>,<em> </em>538 U. S., at ___.  Moreover, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s regulation itself reveals the definitional prescription\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope.  The prescription describes \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of this section,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the section defining \xe2\x80\x9cemployee benefit plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the regulation addresses only what plans qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cemployee benefit plans\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s Title I.  Plans that cover only sole owners or partners and their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside Title I\xe2\x80\x99s domain, while plans that cover working owners <em>and</em> their nonowner employees fall entirely within ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s leading decision also mistakenly relied on ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9canti-inurement\xe2\x80\x9d provision, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71103(c)(1), which states that plan assets shall not inure to the benefit of employers.  Correctly read, that provision does not preclude Title I coverage of working owners as plan participants.  It demands only that plan assets be held to supply benefits to plan participants.  Its purpose is to apply the law of trusts to discourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent investment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers and others.  Those concerns are not implicated by paying benefits to working owners who participate on an equal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protected plans.  This Court expresses no opinion as to whether Yates himself, in his handling of loan repayments, engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurement provision, an issue not yet reached by the courts below.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Given the undisputed fact that Yates failed to honor his loan\xe2\x80\x99s periodic repayment requirements, these questions should be addressed on remand:\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Did the November 1996 close-to-bankruptcy repayments, despite the prior defaults, become a portion of Yates\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the Plan that is excluded from his bankruptcy estate and (2) if so, were the repayments beyond the reach of the Bankruptcy Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s power to avoid and recover preferential transfers?

App. 269a.  Again, he made no monthly payments.  In fact, Yates repaid nothing until November 1996.  287 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 524.  That month, he used the proceeds from the sale of his house to make two payments totaling $50,467.46, which paid off in full the principal and interest due on the loan.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Yates maintained that, after the repayment, his interest in the Profit Sharing Plan amounted to about $87,000.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three weeks after Yates repaid the loan to the Profit Sharing Plan, on December 2, 1996, Yates\xe2\x80\x99s creditors filed an involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  <em>Id</em>., at 12a; accord, App. 300a.  In August 1998, respondent William T. Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint, pursuant to 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7547(b) and 550, against petitioners Profit Sharing Plan and Yates, in his capacity as the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s trustee.  App. 1a\xe2\x80\x933a.  Hendon asked the Bankruptcy Court to \xe2\x80\x9cavoi[d] the \xe2\x80\xa6 preferential transfer by [Yates] to [the Profit Sharing Plan] in the amount of $50,467.46 and [to] orde[r] [the Plan and Yates, as trustee] to pay over to the [bankruptcy] trustee the sum of $50,467.46, plus legal interest . . . , together with costs . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 3a.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court ruled for Trustee Hendon.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a\xe2\x80\x9350a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court first determined that the loan repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U.

The Bankruptcy Court then held that the Profit Sharing Plan and Yates, as trustee, could not rely on the Plan\xe2\x80\x99s anti-alienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the loan repayment.  As \xe2\x80\x9ca self-employed owner of the professional corporation that sponsor[ed] the pension plan,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bankruptcy Court stated, Yates could not \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate as an employee under ERISA and . . . [therefore could not] use its provisions to enforce the restriction on the transfer of his beneficial interest in the Defendant Plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 43a\xe2\x80\x9344a.  In so ruling, the Bankruptcy Court relied on Circuit precedent, including <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Johnston</em>, 143 F.\xc2\xa03d 260 (CA6 1998), and <em>Fugarino</em> v. <em>Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co.</em>, 969 F.\xc2\xa02d 178 (CA6 1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a\xe2\x80\x9335a.   Acknowledging that other Courts of Appeals had reached a different conclusion, <em>id</em>., at 19a, the District Court observed that it was bound by Sixth Circuit precedent.  According to the controlling Sixth Circuit decisions, neither a sole proprietor, <em>Fugarino</em>, 969 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 186, nor a sole owner of a corporation, <em>Agrawal</em> v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.</em>, 205 F.\xc2\xa03d 297, 302 (2000), qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d in an ERISA-sheltered employee benefit plan.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\xe2\x80\x9321a.  Applying Circuit precedent, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact Dr. Yates was not qualified to participate in an ERISA protected plan means none of the money he contributed to the Plan as an \xe2\x80\x98employee\xe2\x80\x99 was ever part of an ERISA plan.  The $50,467.46 he returned to the Plan was not protected by ERISA, because none of the money he had in the Plan was protected by ERISA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 20a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  287 F.\xc2\xa03d 521.  The Court of Appeals adhered to its \xe2\x80\x9cpublished caselaw [holding] that \xe2\x80\x98a sole proprietor or sole shareholder of a business must be considered an employer and not an employee \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of ERISA.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 525 (quoting <em>Fugarino</em>, 969 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 186).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he spendthrift clause in the Yates profit sharing/pension plan,\xe2\x80\x9d the appeals court accordingly ruled, \xe2\x80\x9c[was] not enforceable by Dr. Yates under ERISA.\xe2\x80\x9d  287 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 526.  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Yates was not a \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant\xe2\x80\x9d in the Profit Sharing Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether, had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s reach.

Brief for United States as<em> Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Working shareholders have been eligible to participate in such plans since 1942.  See Revenue Act of 1942, ch. 619, \xc2\xa7165(a)(4), 56 Stat. 862 (a pension plan shall be tax-exempt if, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, persons whose principal duties consist in supervising the work of other employees, or highly compensated employees\xe2\x80\x9d).  Two decades later, still prior to ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, Congress permitted partners and sole proprietors to establish tax-favored pension plans, commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cH.\xc2\xa0R. 10\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cKeogh\xe2\x80\x9d plans.  Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 809; Brief for United States as<em> Amicus Curiae</em> 19.  Thus, by 1962, working owners of all kinds could contribute to tax-qualified retirement plans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1974 did not change that situation.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Rather, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective was to harmonize ERISA with longstanding tax provisions.  Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit plans.  <em>Id</em>., at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  Most notably, several Title I provisions partially exempt certain plans in which working owners likely participate from otherwise mandatory ERISA provisions.  Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To illustrate, Title I frees the following plans from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary responsibility requirements:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) any agreement described in section 736 of [the IRC], which provides payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner\xe2\x80\x99s successor in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe IRC defines the term \xe2\x80\x9chighly compensated employee\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany employee who \xe2\x80\xa6 was a 5-percent owner at any time during the year or the preceding year.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7414(q)(1)(A).  A \xe2\x80\x9c5-percent owner,\xe2\x80\x9d the IRC further specifies, is \xe2\x80\x9cany person who owns \xe2\x80\xa6 more than 5 percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation or stock possessing more than 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all stock of the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d if the employer is a corporation, or \xe2\x80\x9cany person who owns more than 5 percent of the capital or profits interest in the employer\xe2\x80\x9d if the employer is not a corporation.  \xc2\xa7416(i)(1)(B)(i).  Under these definitions, some working owners would fit the description \xe2\x80\x9chighly compensated employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, agreements that make payments to retired partners, or to deceased partners\xe2\x80\x99 successors in interest, surely involve plans in which working partners participate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I also contains more limited exemptions from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary responsibility requirements.  These exemptions, too, cover plans that ordinarily include working owners as participants.  To illustrate, assets of an employee benefit plan typically must be held in trust.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a).  That requirement, however, does\nnot apply, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cto a plan \xe2\x80\xa6 some or all of the participants of which are employees described in section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC].\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(b)(3)(A).  IRC \xc2\xa7401(c)(1)(A) defines an \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9ca self-employed individual\xe2\x80\x9d; and IRC \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7401(c)(1)(B) and (2)(A)(i), in turn, define \xe2\x80\x9ca self-employed individual\xe2\x80\x9d to cover an individual with \xe2\x80\x9cearned income\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9ca trade or business in which personal services of the taxpayer are a material income-producing factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  This definition no doubt encompasses working sole proprietors and partners.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71402(a) and (c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I also contains exemptions from ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibited transaction provisions.  Like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, these exemptions indicate that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans.  For example, although Title I generally bars transactions between a plan and a party in interest, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71106, the Act permits, among other exceptions, loans to plan participants if certain conditions are satisfied,  \xc2\xa71108(b)(1).   One condition is that loans must not be \xe2\x80\x9cmade available to highly compensated employees \xe2\x80\xa6 in an amount greater than the amount made available to other employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71108(b)(1)(B).  As just observed, see<em> supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, some working owners, including shareholder-employees, qualify as \xe2\x80\x9chighly compensated employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Title I goes on to exclude \xe2\x80\x9cowner-employees,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in the IRC, from the participant loan exemption.  \xc2\xa71108(d)(1).  Under the IRC\xe2\x80\x99s definition, owner-employees include partners \xe2\x80\x9cwho ow[n] more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in [a] partnership\xe2\x80\x9d and sole proprietors, but not shareholder-employees.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(c)(3).   In sum, Title I\xe2\x80\x99s provisions involving loans to plan participants, by explicit inclusion or exclusion, assume that working owners\xe2\x80\x94shareholder-employees, partners, and sole proprietors\xe2\x80\x94may participate in ERISA-qualified benefit plans.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative.  Brief for United States as<em> Amicus Curiae</em> 17, and n.\xc2\xa08.  Title IV does not apply to plans \xe2\x80\x9cestablished and maintained <em>exclusively</em> for substantial owners,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71321(b)(9) (emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or greater ownership interest, \xc2\xa71322(b)(5)(A).  But Title IV does cover plans in which substantial owners participate <em>along with</em> other employees.  See \xc2\xa71322(b)(5)(B).  In addition, Title IV does not cover plans established by \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional service employers\xe2\x80\x9d with 25 or fewer active participants.  \xc2\xa71321(b)(13).  Yates\xe2\x80\x99s medical practice was set up as a professional service employer.  See \xc2\xa71321(c)(2)(A) (a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional service employer\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cany proprietorship, partnership, corporation \xe2\x80\xa6 owned or controlled by professional individuals \xe2\x80\xa6 the principal business of which is the performance of professional services\xe2\x80\x9d).  But significantly larger plans\xe2\x80\x94plans covering more than 25 employees\xe2\x80\x94established by a professional service employer would presumably qualify for protection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower courts: Under ERISA, a working owner may have dual status, <em>i.e.,</em> he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at the same time, the employer (or owner or member of the employer) who established the plan.  Both Title IV and the IRC describe the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d of a sole proprietor or partner.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(b)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business is treated as his own employer, and a partnership is treated as the employer of each partner who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC].\xe2\x80\x9d); 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401(c)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business shall be treated as his own employer.  A partnership shall be treated as the employer of each partner who is an employee within the meaning of [\xc2\xa7401(c)(1)].\xe2\x80\x9d).  These descriptions expressly anticipate that a working owner can wear two hats, as an employer and employee.  Cf. <em>Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc., P.\xc2\xa0C. </em>v. <em>Wells</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/440/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/440/index.html">538 U.

The working employer\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity personally to participate and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to the creation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowner employees alike.  See Brief for United States as<em> Amicus Curiae</em> 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Treating working owners as participants not only furthers ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans.  Recognizing the working owner as an ERISA-sheltered plan participant also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes: federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Agrawal</em>, 205 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 302 (because sole shareholder does not rank as a plan participant under ERISA, his state-law claims against insurer are not preempted).  ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s goal, this Court has emphasized, is \xe2\x80\x9cuniform national treatment of pension benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Shumate,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/753/index.html">504 U. S. 753</a>, 765 (1992).  Excepting working owners from the federal Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage would generate administrative difficulties and is hardly consistent with a national uniformity goal.  Cf. <em>Madonia</em>, 11 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 450 (\xe2\x80\x9cDisallowing shareholders \xe2\x80\xa6 from being plan \xe2\x80\x98participants\xe2\x80\x99 would result in disparate treatment of corporate employees\xe2\x80\x99 claims, thereby frustrating the statutory purpose of ensuring similar treatment for all claims relating to employee benefit plans.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note finally that a 1999 Department of Labor advisory opinion accords with our comprehension of Title I\xe2\x80\x99s definition and coverage provisions.

Confirming that working owners may qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concludes:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn our view, the statutory provisions of ERISA, taken as a whole, reveal a clear Congressional design to include \xe2\x80\x98working owners\xe2\x80\x99 within the definition of \xe2\x80\x98participant\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of Title I of ERISA.  Congress could not have intended that a pension plan operated so as to satisfy the complex tax qualification rules applicable to benefits provided to \xe2\x80\x98owner-employees\xe2\x80\x99 under the provisions of Title II of ERISA, and with respect to which an employer faithfully makes the premium payments required to protect the benefits payable under the plan to such individuals under Title IV of ERISA, would somehow transgress against the limitations of the definitions contained in Title I of ERISA.  Such a result would cause an intolerable conflict between the separate titles of ERISA, leading to the sort of \xe2\x80\x98absurd results\xe2\x80\x99 that the Supreme Court warned against in <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Darden,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/318/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/318/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/318/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/318/index.html">503 U.

Like the Department of Labor regulation, see <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, the anti-inurement provision does not address the discrete question whether working owners, along with nonowner employees, may be participants in ERISA-sheltered plans.

Dept. of Labor, Advisory Opinion 99\xe2\x80\x9304A (Feb. 4, 1999), 26 BNA Pension and Benefits Rptr. 559, 560 (1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Department\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive conclusion is certainly reasonable (the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy analysis says that it is inevitable); it is therefore binding upon us.  See <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Thomas</em>, 540 U. S. __, __ (2003) (slip op., at 6).  I would reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit on that basis.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which denies many agency interpretations their conclusive effect and thrusts the courts into authoritative judicial interpretation, deprives administrative agencies of two of their principal virtues: (1) the power to resolve statutory questions promptly, and with nationwide effect, and (2) the power (within the reasonable bounds of the text) to change the application of ambiguous laws as time and experience dictate.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach invites lengthy litigation in all the circuits\xe2\x80\x94the product of which (when finally announced by this Court) is a rule of law that only Congress can change.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961545">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n541 U.

The Court persuasively addresses the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 many errors in this case.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9319.  I do not, however, find convincing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on textual \xe2\x80\x9cindications,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8.  The text of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), is certainly consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d to include so-called \xe2\x80\x9cworking owners.\xe2\x80\x9d*<footcall num="*"> <em>Ibid</em>.  However, the various Title I exemptions relied upon so heavily by the Court, see <em>ante</em>, at 9-11, are equally consistent with an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d that would not include all \xe2\x80\x9cworking owners.\xe2\x80\x9d</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an example, the Court places weight on the exception to the exemption from 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71106, which bars loans made to parties in interest that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98made available to highly compensated employees \xe2\x80\xa6 in an amount greater than the amount made available to other employees.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (quoting 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71108(b)(1)(B)).  The Court notes that \xe2\x80\x9csome working owners . . . qualify as \xe2\x80\x98highly compensated employees.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  That may be true, but there are surely numerous \xe2\x80\x9chighly compensated employees\xe2\x80\x9d who would both be \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d under the usual, common-law meaning of that term (and hence \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA, see <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Darden</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/318/index.html">503 U. S. 318</a> (1992)), and would also not be considered \xe2\x80\x9cworking owners\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court uses the term.  It is entirely possible, then, that Congress was merely attempting to exclude these individuals from \xc2\xa71106, rather than assuming that all \xe2\x80\x9cworking owners\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cemployees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hence, the existence of this exception tells us nothing about whether Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended working owners\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d under ERISA.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the text is inconclusive, we must turn to the common-law understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Darden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 322\xe2\x80\x93323.  On remand, then, I would direct the Court of Appeals to address whether the common-law understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in ERISA, includes Dr. Yates.  I would be surprised if it did not, see <em>In\xc2\xa0re Baker</em>, 114 F.\xc2\xa03d 636, 639 (CA7 1997) (corporation\xe2\x80\x99s separate legal existence from shareholder must be respected), <em>Madonia</em> v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia</em>, 11 F.\xc2\xa03d 444, 448\xe2\x80\x93449 (CA4 1993) (same), but this is a matter best resolved, in the first instance, by the court below.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The Court does not clearly define who exactly makes up this class of \xe2\x80\x9cworking owners,\xe2\x80\x9d even though members of this class are now considered categorically to fall under ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cemployee.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
