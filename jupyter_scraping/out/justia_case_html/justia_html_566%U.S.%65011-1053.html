After his conviction was affirmed in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  The District Court denied habeas relief but the U.\xc2\xa0S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under the standard set forth in Jackson v.

First, on direct appeal, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the responsibility of the jury\xe2\x80\x94not the court\xe2\x80\x94to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial.  A reviewing court may set aside the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d Cavazos v. Smith, \n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2011) (per\xc2\xa0curiam) (slip op., at 1).  And second, on habeas review, \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court.  The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was \xe2\x80\x98objectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Renico v.

Johnson was with Walker on the night of the crime, and the two were tried jointly.  Johnson was charged as an accomplice and co-conspirator.  See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa72502 (2008) (defining first-degree murder as \xe2\x80\x9cwillful, deliberate and premeditated\xe2\x80\x9d killing); \xc2\xa7306(c) (imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it\xe2\x80\x9d); Commonwealth v.

On the morning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the same residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams.  Walker announced that he was going to \xe2\x80\x9choller at\xe2\x80\x9d Williams about a debt Williams owed.  Id., at 217.  According to Doubs, Walker and Williams \xe2\x80\x9cwere talking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,\xe2\x80\x9d with Walker \xe2\x80\x9casking [Williams], confronting him, about his money and what\xe2\x80\x99s up with the money and why is it taking you so long to give us the money.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 217\xe2\x80\x93218.  Williams was \xe2\x80\x9ccussing [Walker] out, telling him he\xe2\x80\x99d give it to him when he felt like it and he ain\xe2\x80\x99t scared of [Walker].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 218.  A fight ensued, which ended when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front of the crowd of people that had gathered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the fight, Doubs testified, Walker \xe2\x80\x9cwas mad, because he got beat by a crackhead.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. He was saying, yo, that crackhead beat me.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill that crackhead.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill that kid.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. He was hot.  He was heated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 220\xe2\x80\x93221.  Johnson was present when Walker made these statements.  Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted the beating to others, who laughed at Walker.  Walker \xe2\x80\x9crepeated it for a while that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill that kid.  That kid must think I\xe2\x80\x99m some type of joke.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill that kid.  Who he think he is[?]\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 222.  Once again, Johnson was present for these statements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnother witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim, who testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar on the night of December 14\xe2\x80\x9315, where she saw Walker, Johnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument.  Although she could not hear what they were saying, she could tell they were arguing because they were making \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of arm movements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 104.  The bouncer soon told them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street because she \xe2\x80\x9cwanted to know what was going on.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Brown observed the three men walking in a single-file line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and Johnson in the back.  Walker was wearing a long leather coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it.  Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to \xe2\x80\x9cgo ahead\xe2\x80\x9d and pass.  Id., at 107.  Walker then entered the alleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained standing at the entrance.  As Brown walked past the alley, she heard a loud \xe2\x80\x9cboom,\xe2\x80\x9d causing her to run away.  Id., at 143.  On cross-examination, Brown stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThey walked [Williams] in that alley.  He stood inside the alley.  He walked him in the alley.  I heard a boom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at 12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15.  He heard a loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes fleeing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey, who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at the time of the murder.  He testified that he saw Williams walking toward an alleyway with two males and a female, and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered the alley.  When pressed on cross-examination, he stated: \xe2\x80\x9cI would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 189.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe jury also heard testimony from police who searched the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun with the barrel missing.  A medical examiner who examined Williams\xe2\x80\x99 body testified that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.  The court denied his motion, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal.  See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726 A.\xc2\xa02d 1079 (1998).  After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief.  He then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, which denied his claims.  See Johnson v. Mechling, 541 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 651 (MD Pa. 2008).  Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third Circuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his conviction overturned.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, \xe2\x80\x9cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  443 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the testimony at Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] trier of fact could reasonably infer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that Johnson and Walker shared a common intent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d  Johnson v. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011).  As for the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson shared Walker\xe2\x80\x99s intent to kill Williams,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the court concluded that was \xe2\x80\x9cmere speculation\xe2\x80\x9d that no rational factfinder could accept as true.  Ibid.  The court stated that \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable inference is one where the fact inferred is \xe2\x80\x98more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 539\xe2\x80\x93540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland, 452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A.\xc2\xa02d 592, 594 (1973)).  In order for a jury\xe2\x80\x99s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned, they must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98flow from facts and circumstances proven in the record\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  446 Fed. Appx., at 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A.\xc2\xa02d 543, 560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what distinguishes a reasoned inference from \xe2\x80\x9cmere speculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state law for \xe2\x80\x9cthe substantive elements of the criminal offense,\xe2\x80\x9d 443 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 324, n.\xc2\xa016, but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the deferential federal standard, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un- duly impinged on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role as factfinder.  Jackson leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring only that jurors \xe2\x80\x9cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 319.  This deferential standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged.  For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Williams was \xe2\x80\x9cwalked\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforced\xe2\x80\x9d into the alleyway, the court objected that the witnesses did not describe any \xe2\x80\x9cphysical action\xe2\x80\x9d supporting the conclusion that force was used.  446 Fed. Appx., at 541.  Absent some specific testimony that \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or otherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented him from leaving it,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the court could see no reason- able basis for the jury\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Johnson had a specific intent to help kill Williams.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat analysis is flawed for two reasons.  First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walker\xe2\x80\x99s behavior could be inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon, and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams after a violent confrontation earlier in the day.  Johnson and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams from fleeing.  And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the murder.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker \xe2\x80\x9cran the streets together,\xe2\x80\x9d and had attempted to collect a debt from Williams earlier on the day of the murder.  Williams resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in the process by giving him a public thrashing with a broomstick.  This enraged Walker to the point that he repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s presence that he intended to kill Williams.  Then, while Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley, where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate.  The jury in this case was convinced, and the only question under Jackson is whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality.  The state court of last review did not think so, and that determination in turn is entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAffording due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson.  The evidence was sufficient to convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams.  The Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
