Harris, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U.S. 37</a> (1971). Rejecting all of them, it ruled in favor of respondents on the merits of the preemption claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the District Court.

Springfield, Vermont v. McCarren, 549 F.Supp. 1134, 1148 (D.Vt.1982). The District Court, relying on our decisions in Durfee v. Duke, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/106/case.html">375 U.S. 106</a> (1963), and Kalb v. Feuerstein, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/433/case.html">308 U.S. 433</a> (1940), in effect held that where the merits of the issue tendered by the federal plaintiff could result in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="944">Page 464 U.S. 942 , 944</a></p><p> a conclusion that the federal regulatory scheme ousted the state regulatory scheme, res judicata does not apply. I think this misreads the decisions upon which the District Court relied, and slights our recent decision in Insurance Corporation of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxetes de Guinee, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/694/case.html">456 U.S. 694</a>, 2104 n. 9 (1982), where the Court said: </p><p> "[a] party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of subject matter jurisdiction may not, however, reopen that question in a collateral attack upon an adverse judgment. It has long been the rule that principles of res judicata apply to jurisdictional determinations-both subject matter and personal. See Chicot County Drainage District v. Bank, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/371/case.html">308 U.S. 371</a> [] ( 1940); Stoll v. Gottlieb, <a href="/cases/federal/us/305/165/case.html">305 U.S. 165</a> [] ( 1938)." </p><p> Kalb v. Feuerstein was a case in which Congress had confided exclusive jurisdiction for settlement of claims to the federal bankruptcy courts, and thereby ousted the state courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims. Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S., at 440. But here, although the federal courts may have reached an entirely correct conclusion on the merits of the federal preemption issue, there is not the remotest suggestion that Congress by enactment of legislation authorizing federal licensing of hydroelectric projects intended to deprive the Vermont Public Service Board of authority to hear any claim relating to such projects that would otherwise be within the jurisdiction of the Board. </p><p> Although the fact that the adjudicating agency in this case was a state agency, rather than a state court, may make some difference as to the extent to which res judicata principles apply, it is by no means dispositive of the issue.* "Occasionally courts have used language to the effect that res judicata principles do not apply to administrative proceedings, but such language is certainly too broad." United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/394/case.html">384 U.S. 394</a>, 421-422, 1559- 60 (1966) (footnotes omitted). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="945">Page 464 U.S. 942 , 945</a></p><p> At a time when judges and observers are increasingly concerned with the work load of the federal courts, the application of principles of res judicata to disputes such as this might both conserve the time of the federal courts and make for a more orderly resolution of this and similar disputes. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] This case may also present a question left open in Gibson v. Berryhill, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/564/case.html">411 U.S. 564</a>, 575-577, 1696-97 ( 1973): whether respondents were required by the line of cases beginning with Younger v. Harris, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U.S. 37</a> (1971), to pursue their avenues of appeal from the administrative ruling within the state court system. As this Court observed in Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#608">420 U.S. 592, 608</a>, 1210 (1975), "virtually all of the evils at which Younger is directed . . . inhere in federal intervention prior to completion of state appellate proceedings." </p><p> </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
