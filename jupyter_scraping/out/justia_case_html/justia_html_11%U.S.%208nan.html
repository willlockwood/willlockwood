S. 216</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>This suit was instituted on a promissory note executed by the defendant and made payable to the plaintiff.  After describing the note accurately, with the exception of the time when it became payable, which is altogether omitted, the declaration proceeds in the usual form to state that the defendant, being so liable, assumed to pay the sum mentioned in the note when he should be thereunto required, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>To this count a special plea was filed which, on demurrer, was held insufficient.  Judgment, on the demurrer, being rendered for the plaintiff, a writ of inquiry was awarded.</p>\n<p>On executing this writ, the plaintiff produced a note payable sixty days after date and offered to prove that it was the note on which the suit was instituted and that the omission to state the day of payment in the declaration was the mistake of counsel.</p>\n<p>The court refused to permit the note to go to the jury, and also instructed them that unless a note conforming to the declaration should be adduced or its absence accounted for, they must presume it to have been passed away or paid.  The jury under these instructions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 11 U. S. 217</a></p><p> found one cent damages, for which judgment was rendered.  To this judgment the plaintiff has sued out a writ of error.</p>\n<p>The errors assigned are 1st, that the variance was not fatal; 2d, that on a writ of inquiry the production of the note was unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Courts, being established for the purpose of administering real justice to individuals, will feel much reluctance at the necessity of deciding a cause on a slip in pleading or on the inadvertence of counsel.  They can permit a cause to go off on such points only when some rule of law the observance of which is deemed essential to the general administration of justice peremptorily requires it.</p>\n<p>One of these rules is that in all actions on special agreements or written contracts, the contract given in evidence must correspond with that stated in the declaration.  The reason of this rule is too familiar to every lawyer to require that it should be repeated.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to recite the contract <em>in haec verba,</em> but if it be recited, the recital must be strictly accurate.  If the instrument be declared on according to its legal effect, that effect must be truly stated.  If there be a failure in the one respect or the other, an exception for the variance, may be taken, and the plaintiff cannot give the instrument in evidence.</p>\n<p>The plea of <em>nonassumpsit</em> denies the contract, and an instrument, not conforming to the declaration either in words where it is recited, or according to its legal effect where the legal effect is stated, although proved to be the act of the defendant, is not the same act, and therefore does not maintain the issue on his part.</p>\n<p>In this case, the legal effect of the promissory note is stated, and that effect on a note having no day of payment would be that it was payable immediately.  This declaration goes on that idea, and avers a promise to pay when required.  A note payable sixty days after date is a note different from one payable immediately, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 11 U. S. 218</a></p><p> and would not support the issue had <em>nonassumpsit</em> been pleaded and issue joined on this plea.</p>\n<p>Now what difference is produced by the default of the defendant?  He confesses the note stated in the declaration, but he confesses no other note.  The necessity then of showing a note conforming to the declaration is precisely as strong on executing a writ of inquiry, as on trying the issue.  No reason is perceived why a variance which would be fatal in the one case would not be equally fatal in the other.</p>\n<p>The cases cited by the plaintiff\'s counsel have been considered, but they do not come up to this.  They are not cases where the legal effect of the written instrument, offered on executing the writ of inquiry, has differed from that of the instrument stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p>The Court is also of opinion that the production of the note, on executing the writ of inquiry, was necessary.  The default dispenses with the proof of the note, but not with its production.  In England, damages have in some circumstances been assessed without a jury, but it is not stated that those damages have been assessed without a view of the note.  The practice of this country is to require that the note should be produced, or its absence accounted for, and the rule is a safe one.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
