If an inhabitant clandestinely withdraws, or secretes himself, to avoid his creditors, he becomes liable to the Domestic Attachment. The having once been an inhabitant will not, however, protect a man forever from a Foreign Attachment, where he has notoriously emigrated from the State, and settled elsewhere. But the case before the Court, is that of a Foreign Attachment issued at the very time that the Defendant was an inhabitant of the State, which cannot be maintained. </p><p> Let the rule be made absolute. </p><p> Willcocks and Sergeant, for the Plaintiff; Ingersol, for the Defendant. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1907547">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> LYLE v.
