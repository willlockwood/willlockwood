In 2012, the Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal tax statutes, a provision in\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77212(a) known as the Omnibus Clause, which forbids \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly or by force or threats of force .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].\xe2\x80\x9d  The judge instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause violation, it must find that he \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d engaged in at least one of eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.  Marinello was convicted.  The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular investigation.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0To convict a defendant under the Omnibus Clause, the Government must prove the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could reasonably foresee that such a proceeding would commence.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Aguilar</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 593\n, this Court interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute\xe2\x80\x94which made it a felony \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly or by threats or force .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [to] influenc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71503(a).  There, the Court required the Government to show there was a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding.  The Court said that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cact must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599<i>.</i>  In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has \xe2\x80\x9ctraditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress<i> </i>and out of concern that \xe2\x80\x98a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 600.  That reasoning applies here with similar strength.  The verbs \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimpede\xe2\x80\x9d require an object.  The taxpayer must hinder a particular person or thing.  The object in \xc2\xa77212(a) is the \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of [the Tax Code].\xe2\x80\x9d  That phrase is best viewed, like the \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of justice\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>Aguilar</i>, as referring to discrete targeted administrative acts rather than every conceivable task involved in the Tax Code\xe2\x80\x99s administration.  Statutory context confirms this reading.  The Omnibus Clause appears in the middle of a sentence that refers to efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cintimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States<i> </i>acting in an official capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77212(a).  The first part of the sentence also refers to \xe2\x80\x9cforce or threats of force,\xe2\x80\x9d which the statute elsewhere defines as \xe2\x80\x9cthreats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States or to a member of his family.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Ibid.  </i>And \xc2\xa77212(b) refers to the \xe2\x80\x9cforcibl[e] rescu[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany property after it shall have been seized under\xe2\x80\x9d the Internal Revenue Code.  Subsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual identifiable persons or property.  In context, the Omnibus Clause logically serves as a \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d for the obstructive conduct the subsection sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine administrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history does not suggest otherwise.  The broader context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading.  Interpreting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could transform the Code\xe2\x80\x99s numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies, making them redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bargaining.  It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this Court to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise\xe2\x80\x9d interpretive \xe2\x80\x9crestraint\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>Aguilar</i>.  See 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.  The Government claims that the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt state of mind\xe2\x80\x9d requirement will cure any overbreadth problem, but it is difficult to imagine a scenario when that requirement will make a practical difference in the context of federal tax prosecutions.  And to rely on prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute\xe2\x80\x99s general language places too much power in the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Government here must show that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.  See <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 599.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cparticular administrative proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their administration of the Tax Code.  Just because a taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.  In addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the Government must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.

The question here concerns the breadth of that statutory phrase.  Does it cover virtually all governmental efforts to collect taxes?  Or does it have a narrower scope?  In our view, \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of [the Tax Code]\xe2\x80\x9d does not cover routine administrative procedures that are near-universally applied to all taxpayers, such as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.

In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charging him with violations of several criminal tax statutes including the Omnibus Clause.  In respect to the Omnibus Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had engaged in at least one of eight different specified activities, including \xe2\x80\x9cfailing to maintain corporate books and records,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfailing to provide\xe2\x80\x9d his tax accountant \xe2\x80\x9cwith complete and accurate\xe2\x80\x9d tax \xe2\x80\x9cinformation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdestroying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. business records,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chiding income,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpaying employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with cash.\xe2\x80\x9d  839 F.\xc2\xa03d 209, 213 (CA2 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge instructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he engaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned, that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he did so \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cwith the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself\xc2\xa0] or for another.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 15\xe2\x80\x932224 (CA2), p. 432.  The judge, however, did not instruct the jury that it must find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.  The jury subsequently convicted Marinello on all counts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Marinello appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  He argued, among other things, that a violation of the Omnibus Clause requires the Government to show that the defendant had tried to interfere with a \xe2\x80\x9cpending IRS proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a particular investigation.  Brief for Appellant in No. 15\xe2\x80\x932224, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9325.  The appeals court disagreed.  It held<i> </i>that a defendant need not possess \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an awareness of a particular [IRS] action or investigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  839 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, 384 Fed.

In light of a division of opinion among the Circuits on this point, we granted the petition.  Compare <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kassouf</i>, 144 F.\xc2\xa03d 952 (CA6 1998) (requiring showing of a pending proceeding), with 839 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221 (disagreeing with <i>Kassouf\xc2\xa0</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Aguilar</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 593 (1995)\n, we interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute.  That statute made it a felony \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, [to] influenc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71503(a).  The statute concerned not (as here) \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of\xe2\x80\x9d <i>the Internal Revenue Code</i> but rather \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of <i>justice</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (We have placed the full text of \xc2\xa71503 in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In interpreting that statute we pointed to earlier cases in which courts had held that the Government must prove \xe2\x80\x9can intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 599 (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Brown</i>, 688 F.\xc2\xa02d 596, 598 (CA9 1982)).  We noted that some courts had imposed a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98nexus\xe2\x80\x99 requirement\xe2\x80\x9d: that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cact must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 599<i> </i>(citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, 6 F.\xc2\xa03d 692, 696 (CA10 1993), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Walasek</i>, 527 F.\xc2\xa02d 676, 679, and n.\xc2\xa012 (CA3 1975)).  And we adopted the same requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We set forth two important reasons for doing so.  We wrote that we \xe2\x80\x9chave traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress<i> </i>and out of concern that \xe2\x80\x98a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 600 (quoting <i>McBoyle</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25,\n27 (1931)\n; citation omitted).  Both reasons apply here with similar strength.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, the literal language of the statute is neutral.  The statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct or impede\xe2\x80\x9d are broad.  They can refer to anything that \xe2\x80\x9cblock[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmake[s] difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chinder[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1246 (10th ed. 2014) (obstruct); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary (Webster\xe2\x80\x99s) 1248 (2d ed. 1954) (impede); <i>id.,</i> at 1682 (obstruct); accord, 5 Oxford English Dictionary 80 (1933) (impede); 7 <i>id.,</i> at 36 (obstruct).  But the verbs \xe2\x80\x9cobstruct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimpede\xe2\x80\x9d suggest an object\xe2\x80\x94the taxpayer must hinder a particular person or thing.  Here, the object is the \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9cadministration\xe2\x80\x9d can be read literally to refer to every \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ct or process of administering\xe2\x80\x9d including every act of \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconduct[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9coffice,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cperforming the executive duties of\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cinstitution, business, or the like.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 34.  But the whole phrase\xe2\x80\x94the due administration of the Tax Code\xe2\x80\x94is best viewed, like the due administration of justice, as referring to only some of those acts or to some separable parts of an institution or business.  Cf. <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 600\xe2\x80\x93601 (concluding false statements made to an investigating agent, rather than a grand jury, do not support a conviction for obstruction of justice)<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here statutory context confirms that the text refers to specific, targeted acts of administration.  The Omnibus Clause appears in the middle of a statutory sentence that refers specifically to efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cintimidate or impede <i>any officer or employee of the United States </i>acting in an official capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77212(a) (emphasis added).  The first part of the sentence also refers to \xe2\x80\x9cforce or threats of force,\xe2\x80\x9d which the statute elsewhere defines as \xe2\x80\x9cthreats of bodily harm to the <i>officer or employee of the United States or to a member of his family</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).<i> </i>The following subsection refers to the \xe2\x80\x9cforcibl[e] rescu[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cany <i>property</i> after it shall have been seized under\xe2\x80\x9d the Internal Revenue Code.  \xc2\xa77212(b) (emphasis added).  Subsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual identifiable persons or property.  And, in that context the Omnibus Clause logically serves as a \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to the obstructive conduct the subsection sets forth, not as a \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d for every violation that interferes with what the Government describes as the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous, ubiquitous, and universally known\xe2\x80\x9d administration of the Internal Revenue Code.  Brief in Opposition 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Those who find legislative history helpful can find confirmation of the more limited scope of the Omnibus Clause in the House and Senate Reports written when Congress first enacted the Omnibus Clause.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954); S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954).  According to the House Report, \xc2\xa77212 \xe2\x80\x9cprovides for the punishment of threats or threatening acts against <i>agents </i>of the Internal Revenue Service, or any other <i>officer </i>or <i>employee </i>of the United States, or <i>members of the families of such persons, </i>on account of the performance by such agents or officers or employees of their official duties\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<i>will also punish the corrupt solicitation of an internal revenue employee</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i> H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1337, at A426 (emphasis added).  The Senate Report also refers to the section as aimed at targeting officers and employees.  It says that \xc2\xa77212 \xe2\x80\x9ccovers all cases where the <i>officer</i> is intimidated or injured; <i>that is</i>, where corruptly, by force or threat of force, directly or by communication, an attempt is made to impede the administration of the internal-revenue laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1622, at 147 (emphasis added).  We have found nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history suggesting that Congress intended the Omnibus Clause as a catchall applicable to the entire Code including the routine processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments, and issuance of tax refunds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Viewing the Omnibus Clause in the broader statutory context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels against adopting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad reading.  That is because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, ranging from willful failure to furnish a required statement to employees, \xc2\xa77204, to failure to keep required records, \xc2\xa77203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to which an employee is entitled on IRS Form W\xe2\x80\x934, \xc2\xa77205, to failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount, \xc2\xa77203<i>.</i>  To interpret the Omnibus Clause as applying to all Code administration would potentially transform many, if not all, of these misdemeanor provisions into felonies, making the specific provisions redundant, or perhaps the subject matter of plea bargaining.  Some overlap in criminal provisions is, of course, inevitable.  See, <i>e.g., Sansone</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343,\n349 (1965)\n (affirming conviction for tax evasion despite overlap with other provisions).  Indeed, as the dissent notes, <i>post, </i>at 8 (opinion of Thomas, J.), Marinello\xe2\x80\x99s preferred reading of \xc2\xa77212 potentially overlaps with another provision of federal law that criminalizes the obstruction of the \xe2\x80\x9cdue and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71505.  But we have not found any case from this Court interpreting a statutory provision that would create overlap and redundancy to the degree that would result from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad reading of \xc2\xa77212\xe2\x80\x94particularly when it would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868,\n877 (1991)\n (quoting <i>Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare</i> v. <i>Davenport</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n562 (1990)\n; see also <i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A broad interpretation would also risk the lack of fair warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this Court in <i>Aguilar</i> to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise\xe2\x80\x9d interpretive \xe2\x80\x9crestraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600; see also <i>Yates</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319); <i>Arthur Andersen LLP</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696\n\xe2\x80\x93704 (2005).  Interpreted broadly, the provision could apply to a person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash without withholding taxes, see 26 CFR \xc2\xa731.3102\xe2\x80\x931(a)(2017); IRS, Publication 926, pp. 5\xe2\x80\x936 (2018), leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep donation receipts from every charity to which he or she contributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant.  Such an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing so, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule, but we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a potential felony prosecution for tax obstruction.  Had Congress intended that outcome, it would have spoken with more clarity than it did in \xc2\xa77212(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government argues that the need to show the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s obstructive conduct was done \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d will cure any overbreadth problem.  But we do not see how.  The Government asserts that \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d means acting with \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage\xe2\x80\x9d for the defendant or another.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37; accord, 839 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 218.  Yet, practically speaking, we struggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d violate the Tax Code (the <i>mens rea</i> requirement of various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see, <i>e.g., </i>26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.<i> </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77203, 7204, 7207) without intending someone to obtain an unlawful advantage.  See <i>Cheek</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n201 (1991)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cWillfulness .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. requires the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty\xe2\x80\x9d)  A taxpayer may know with a fair degree of certainty that her babysitter will not declare a cash payment as income\xe2\x80\x94and, if so, a jury could readily find that the taxpayer acted to obtain an unlawful benefit for another.  For the same reason, we find unconvincing the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at least as defined by the Government\xe2\x80\x94reflects any meaningful difference in culpability.  See <i>post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither can we rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  True, the Government used the Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few decades after its enactment.  But it used the clause more often after the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.  Brief for Petitioner 9.  And,  at oral argument the Government told us that, where more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both apply to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, the Government will charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long as it can readily prove that violation at trial.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46\xe2\x80\x9347, 55\xe2\x80\x9357; see Office of the Attorney General, Department Charging and Sentencing Policy (May 10, 2017), online at http://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/ file/965896/download (as last visited Mar. 16, 2018).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute\xe2\x80\x99s highly abstract general statutory language places great power in the hands of the prosecutor.  Doing so risks allowing \xe2\x80\x9cpolicemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Goguen</i>,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 566,\n575 (1974)\n, which could result in the nonuniform execution of that power across time and geographic location.  And insofar as the public fears arbitrary prosecution, it risks undermining necessary confidence in the criminal justice system.  That is one reason why we have said that we \xe2\x80\x9ccannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption that the Government will \xe2\x80\x98use it responsibly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McDonnell</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 23) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Stevens</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 460,\n480 (2010)\n).  And it is why \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 600.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, we follow the approach we have taken in similar cases in interpreting \xc2\xa77212(a)\xe2\x80\x99s Omnibus Clause.  To be sure, the language and history of the provision at issue here differ somewhat from that of other obstruction provisions we have considered in the past.  See <i>Aguilar, supra </i>(interpreting a statute prohibiting the obstruction of \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of justice\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Arthur Andersen</i>, <i>supra</i> (interpreting a statute prohibiting the destruction of an object with intent to impair its integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding); <i>Yates, supra</i> (interpreting a statute prohibiting the destruction, concealment, or covering up of any \xe2\x80\x9crecord, document, or tangible object with the intent to\xe2\x80\x9d obstruct the \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government and the dissent urge us to ignore these precedents because of those differences.  The dissent points out, for example, that the predecessor to the obstruction statute we interpreted in <i>Aguilar</i>,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71503, prohibited influencing, intimidating, or impeding \xe2\x80\x9cany witness or officer in any court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d or endeavoring \xe2\x80\x9cto obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of justice <i>therein</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pettibone</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n148 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197,\n202 (1893)\n (citing Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa75399; emphasis added); see <i>post, </i>at 9.  But Congress subsequently deleted the word \xe2\x80\x9ctherein,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving only a broadly worded prohibition against obstruction of \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 25, 1948, \xc2\xa71503,\n\n62Stat.\n769\xe2\x80\x93770.  Congress then used that same amended formulation when it enacted \xc2\xa77212, prohibiting the \xe2\x80\x9cobstruction of the due administration\xe2\x80\x9d of the Tax Code.  Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 855.  Given this similarity, it is helpful to consider how we have interpreted \xc2\xa71503 and other obstruction statutes in considering \xc2\xa77212.  The language of some and the underlying principles of all these cases are similar.  We consequently find these precedents\xe2\x80\x94though not controlling\xe2\x80\x94highly instructive for use as a guide toward a proper resolution of the issue now before us.  See <i>Smith</i> v. <i>City of Jackson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228,\n233 (2005)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We conclude that, to secure a conviction under the Omnibus Clause, the Government must show (among other things) that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.  That nexus requires a \xe2\x80\x9crelationship in time, causation, or logic with the [administrative] proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aguilar</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599 (citing <i>Wood</i>, 6 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 696).  By \xe2\x80\x9cparticular administrative proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d we do not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous, ubiquitous, and universally known\xe2\x80\x9d administration of the Tax Code.  Brief in Opposition 9.  While we need not here exhaustively itemize the types of administrative conduct that fall within the scope of the statute, that conduct does not include routine, day-to-day work carried out in the ordinary course by the IRS, such as the review of tax returns.  The Government contends the processing of tax returns is part of the administration of the Internal Revenue Code and any corrupt effort to interfere with that task can therefore serve as the basis of an obstruction conviction.  But the same could have been said of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s effort to mislead the investigating agent in <i>Aguilar.  </i>The agent\xe2\x80\x99s investigation was, at least in some broad sense, a part of the administration of justice.  But we nevertheless held the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct did not support an obstruction charge.  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600.<i> </i>In light of our decision in <i>Aguilar, </i>we find it appropriate to construe \xc2\xa77212\xe2\x80\x99s Omnibus Clause more narrowly than the Government proposes.  Just because a taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return every year does not transform every violation of the Tax Code into an obstruction charge.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to satisfying this nexus requirement, the Government must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.  See <i>Arthur Andersen</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 703, 707\xe2\x80\x93708 (requiring the Government to prove a proceeding was foreseeable in order to convict a defendant for persuading others to shred documents to prevent their \xe2\x80\x9cuse in an official proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is not enough for the Government to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch on to his unlawful scheme eventually.  To use a maritime analogy, the proceeding must at least be in the offing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77212: \xe2\x80\x9cAttempts to interfere with administration of internal revenue laws</b></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Corrupt or forcible interference</b></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity under this title, or in any other way corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both, except that if the offense is committed only by threats of force, the person convicted thereof shall be fined not more than $3,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.

And he took tens of thousands of dollars from the company each year to pay his personal expenses.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unbeknownst to Marinello, the IRS began investigating him in 2004.  The IRS learned that he had not filed a tax return\xe2\x80\x94corporate or individual\xe2\x80\x94since at least 1992.  But the investigation came to a standstill because the IRS did not have enough information about Marinello\xe2\x80\x99s earnings.  This was not surprising given his diligent efforts to avoid creating a paper trail.  After the investigation ended, Marinello consulted a lawyer and an accountant, both of whom advised him that he needed to file tax returns and keep business records.

Collection refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of obtaining payment of taxes due.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Subtitle F of the Tax Code\xe2\x80\x94titled \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure and Administration\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94contains directives related to each of these steps.  It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and file certain returns, \xc2\xa76001; specifies that taxpayers with qualifying incomes must file returns, \xc2\xa76012; and author- izes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for taxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent ones, \xc2\xa76020.  It requires the Secretary to make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of tax liabilities.  \xc2\xa76201.  And it authorizes the Secretary to collect and levy taxes.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76301, 6331.  Subtitle F also gives the Secretary the power to commence proceedings to recover unpaid taxes or fees, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77401\xe2\x80\x937410, and to conduct investigations into the accuracy of particular returns, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77601\xe2\x80\x937613.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of this title\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the entire process of taxation, from gathering information to assessing tax liabilities to collecting and levying taxes.  It is not limited to only a few specific provisions within the Tax Code.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court rejects this straightforward reading, describing the \xe2\x80\x9cliteral language\xe2\x80\x9d of the Omnibus Clause as \xe2\x80\x9cneutral.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 4.  It concludes that the statute prohibits only acts related to a pending or imminent proceeding.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  There is no textual or contextual support for this limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of the Omnibus Clause is not \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d; it omits the limitation that the Court reads into it.  The Omnibus Clause nowhere suggests that \xe2\x80\x9conly some of\xe2\x80\x9d the processes in the Tax Code are covered, <i>ante,</i> at 5, or that the line between covered and uncovered processes is drawn at some vague notion of \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Omnibus Clause does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d at all, but instead refers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more than that.  This Court cannot \xe2\x80\x9clightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jama </i>v. <i>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335,\n341 (2005)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the Court turns to context.  However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of \xc2\xa77212 are limited to actions \xe2\x80\x9ctaken against individual identifiable persons or property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 5.  But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of a general omnibus clause.  See <i>Ali </i>v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,\n225 (2008)\n (explaining that the <i>ejusdem generis</i> canon does not apply to a \xe2\x80\x9cdisjunctive\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in a statute \xe2\x80\x9cwith one specific and one general category\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor do the other clauses in \xc2\xa77212 contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause.  See \xc2\xa77212(a) (prohibiting efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cintimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa77212(b) (prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cforcibly rescu[ing] or caus[ing] to be rescued any property after it shall have been seized under this title\xe2\x80\x9d).  They thus provide no support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s atextual limitation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court asserts that its reading prevents the Omnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misdemeanors in the Tax Code.  <i>Ante</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (discussing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77203, 7204, 7205).  But there is no redundancy problem because these provisions have different <i>mens rea</i> requirements.  The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly,\xe2\x80\x9d but the misdemeanor provisions require that an act be done \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully.\xe2\x80\x9d  The difference between these <i>mens rea </i>requirements is significant.  While \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d requires proof only \xe2\x80\x9cthat the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cheek </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n201 (1991)\n, \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d requires proof that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cact[ed] with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other person,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Floyd</i>, 740 F.\xc2\xa03d 22, 31 (CA1 2014) (collecting cases); see also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (\xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally imports a wrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other advantage\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly\xe2\x80\x9d requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful benefit\xe2\x80\x9d but that his \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d was to obtain that unlawful benefit.  See 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law \xc2\xa7114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent requires both knowledge and purpose).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court dismisses the significance of the different <i>mens rea</i> requirements, see <i>ante</i>, at 8, but this difference is important under basic principles of criminal law.  The law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed with a higher <i>mens rea</i>, is more culpable and thus more deserving of punishment.  See <i>Schad</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624,\n643 (1991)\n (plurality opinion).  For that reason, different <i>mens rea</i> requirements often differentiate culpability for the same conduct.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 40 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Homicide \xc2\xa780 (2014) (explaining that the distinction between first- and second-degree murder is based on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind); \xc2\xa7103 (same for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter).  Unless the Court means to cast doubt on this well-established principle, it should not casually dismiss the different <i>mens rea</i> requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with these other misdemeanors, that would prove little.  For better or worse, redundancy abounds in both the criminal law and the Tax Code.  This Court has repeatedly declined to depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because the same conduct would be criminalized under two or more provisions.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Loughrin </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2014) (slip op., at 7, n.\xc2\xa04) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, the overlap between the two clauses is substantial on our reading, but that is not uncommon in criminal statutes\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Hubbard </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 695\n, n.\xc2\xa014 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may, and often does, enact separate criminal statutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same conduct\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Sansone </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343,\n352 (1965)\n (allowing the Government to proceed on a felony tax evasion charge even though that charge \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98covered precisely the same ground\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as two misdemeanors in the Tax Code).  In fact, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.  Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code\xe2\x80\x94such as failing to obey a summons, \xc2\xa77210\xe2\x80\x94apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause largely redundant with\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71505, which already prohibits \xe2\x80\x9ccorruptly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Cf. <i>Marx </i>v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,\n385 (2013)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he canon against surplusage \xe2\x80\x98assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court contends that its narrow reading of \xe2\x80\x9cdue administration of this title\xe2\x80\x9d is supported by three decisions interpreting other obstruction statutes, though it admits that the \xe2\x80\x9clanguage and history\xe2\x80\x9d of the Omnibus Clause \xe2\x80\x9cdiffer somewhat\xe2\x80\x9d from those other obstruction provisions.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9 (citing <i>United States </i>v.<i> Aguilar</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 593 (1995)\n; <i>Arthur Andersen LLP </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696 (2005)\n; <i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015) (plurality opinion)).  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]iffer somewhat\xe2\x80\x9d is putting  it lightly.  The differences between the Omnibus Clause and those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why  the former does not contain the Court\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding  requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Aguilar</i> interpreted\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71503.  The omnibus clause of \xc2\xa71503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court concluded that this language requires the prosecution to prove a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s obstructive act and \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599\xe2\x80\x93600.  But this nexus requirement was based on the specific history of \xc2\xa71503.  The predecessor to that statute prohibited obstructing \xe2\x80\x9cthe due administration of justice\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin any <i>court </i>of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pettibone </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n148 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197,\n202 (1893)\n (citing Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa75399).  Based on this statutory history, the Court assumed that \xc2\xa71503 continued to refer to the administration of justice in a court.  <i>Aguilar</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 599.  None of that history is present here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Arthur Anderson</i> is even further afield.  There the Court interpreted\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71512(b)(2)(A), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. corruptly persuad[ing] another person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with intent to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cause or induce [that] person to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Relying on <i>Aguilar</i>, the Court concluded that \xc2\xa71512(b)(2)(A) required the Government to show a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9c[a] particular proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 707\xe2\x80\x93708.  But this nexus requirement came from the statutory text, which expressly included \xe2\x80\x9can official<i> </i>proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  If anything, then, \xc2\xa71512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress knows how to impose a \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d requirement when it wants to do so.  See <i>Kucana </i>v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 233,\n248 (2010)\n; <i>Jama</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 341.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Yates</i> underscores this point.  There the Court interpreted\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71519, which prohibits obstructing \xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The four Justices in the plurality recognized that this language made \xc2\xa71519 broader than other obstruction statutes: Section 1519 \xe2\x80\x9ccovers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including one<i> </i>not even on the verge of commencement.\xe2\x80\x9d  574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  The plurality contrasted the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficial proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that the latter is broader. <i> Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313).  The same is true for the broad language of the Omnibus Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and history justify it, this Court interprets obstruction statutes to include a proceeding requirement.  But we have never inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute without textual or historical support.  Today the Court does precisely that.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">All else having failed, the Court invokes lenity-sounding concerns to justify reading its proceeding requirement into the Omnibus Clause.  See <i>ante</i>, at 4, 7.  But the rule of lenity applies only if after applying ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, \xe2\x80\x9cthere remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barber </i>v. <i>Thomas</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474,\n488 (2010)\n (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court identifies no such grievous ambiguity in the Omnibus Clause, and breadth is not the same thing as ambiguity.  The Omnibus Clause is both \xe2\x80\x9cvery broad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvery clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Yates</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15).  Lenity does not apply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the Court is concerned that the Omnibus Clause does not give defendants \xe2\x80\x9cfair warning\xe2\x80\x9d of what it prohibits, <i>ante,</i> at 7, I am hard pressed to see how today\xe2\x80\x99s decision makes things better.  The Court outlines its atextual proceeding requirement in only the vaguest of terms.  Under its interpretation, the prosecution must prove a \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and some \xe2\x80\x9cparticular administrative proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]articular administrative proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d is defined negatively as \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their \xe2\x80\x98continuous, ubiquitous, and universally known\xe2\x80\x99 administration of the Tax Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311<i>.</i>  Further, the Government must prove that the proceeding was \xe2\x80\x9creasonably foreseeable\xe2\x80\x9d to the defendant.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  \xe2\x80\x9cReasonably foreseeable\xe2\x80\x9d is again defined negatively as \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the defendant knew the IRS may catch onto his unlawful scheme eventually.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  It is hard to see how the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statute is less vague than the one Congress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not to corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS\xe2\x80\x99 administration of the Tax Code.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To be sure, \xc2\xa77212(a) is a sweeping obstruction statute.  Congress may well have concluded that a broad statute was warranted because \xe2\x80\x9cour tax structure is based on a system of self-reporting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government depends upon the good faith and integrity of each potential tax- payer to disclose honestly all information relevant to tax liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bisceglia</i>,\n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141,\n145 (1975)\n.

Whether the Omnibus Clause would cover these hypotheticals\xe2\x80\x94and whether the Government would waste its resources identifying and prosecuting them\xe2\x80\x94is debatable.  But what should not be debatable is that the statute covers Marinello, who systematically shredded documents and hid evidence about his company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings to avoid paying taxes even after warnings from his lawyer and accountant.  It is not hard to find similar cases prosecuted under the Omnibus Clause.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Sorenson</i>, 801 F.\xc2\xa03d 1217, 1221\xe2\x80\x931222 (CA10 2015) (defendant hid taxable income in elaborate system of trusts); <i>Floyd</i>, 740 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (defendant created elaborate scheme to avoid paying payroll taxes).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, in its effort to exclude hypotheticals, has constructed an opening in the Omnibus Clause large enough that even the worst offenders can escape liability.  In doing so, it failed to heed what this Court recognized in a similar case: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he authority vested in tax collectors may be abused, as all power is subject to abuse.
