Argued November 12, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 24, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">A collective-bargaining agreement between petitioner company and a union eliminated the company\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide health benefits to subsequently retired employees, except as to then-current workers at least 50 years old.  Respondent employees (collectively, Cline)\xe2\x80\x94who were then at least 40 and thus protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), but under 50 and so without promise of the benefits\xe2\x80\x94claimed before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that the agreement violated the ADEA because it \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d against them] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [their] age,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  The EEOC agreed, and invited the company and the union to settle informally with Cline.  When they failed, Cline brought this action under the ADEA and state law.  The District Court dismissed, calling the federal claim one of \xe2\x80\x9creverse age discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d upon which no court had ever granted relief under the ADEA, and relying on a Seventh Circuit decision holding that the ADEA does not protect younger workers <em>against</em> older workers.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, reasoning that \xc2\xa7623(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of discrimination is so clear on its face that if Congress had meant to limit its coverage to protect only the older worker against the younger, it would have said so.  The court acknowledged that its ruling conflicted with earlier cases, but criticized those decisions for paying too much attention to the general language of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ADEA findings.  The court also drew support from the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s position in an interpretive regulation.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, purpose, history, and relationship to other federal statutes show that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition covers \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d that helps the younger by hurting the older.  In the abstract, that phrase is open to the broader construction that it also prohibits favor for the old over the young, since \xc2\xa7623(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d carries no express modifier, and the word could be read to look two ways.  This more expansive possible understanding does not, however, square with the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination.  In fact Congress\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive clues speak almost unanimously to an understanding of discrimination as directed against workers who are older than the ones getting treated better.  The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s prefatory finding and purpose provisions and their legislative history make a case to this effect that is beyond reasonable doubt.  Nor is it remarkable that the record is devoid of any evidence that younger workers were suffering at their elders\xe2\x80\x99 expense, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one.  The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s restriction of the protected class to those 40 and above confirms this interpretation.  If Congress had been worrying about protecting the younger against the older, it would not likely have ignored everyone under 40.  The federal case reports are as replete with decisions taking this position as they are nearly devoid of decisions like the one under review.  While none of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases directly addresses the question presented here, all of them show the Court\xe2\x80\x99s consistent understanding that the text, structure, and history point to the ADEA as a remedy for unfair preference based on relative youth, leaving complaints of the relatively young outside the statutory concern.  See, <em>e.g., Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html">507 U. S. 604</a>, 610.  The very strength of this consensus is enough to rule out any serious claim of ambiguity, and congressional silence after years of judicial interpretation supports adherence to that view.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0This Court rejects the three rejoinders proffered by Cline and <em>amicus</em> EEOC in favor of their view that the statutory age discrimination prohibition works both ways.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The argument that, because other instances of \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d in the ADEA are not limited to old age, \xc2\xa7623(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d phrase means treatment that would not have occurred if the individual\xe2\x80\x99s span of years had been either longer or shorter, rests on two mistakes.  First, it erroneously assumes that the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d has the same meaning wherever the ADEA uses it.  The presumption that identical words in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433, is not rigid and readily yields where, as here, there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the Act with different intent, <em>e.g., ibid.  </em>Second, the argument for uniform usage ignores the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context since a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.  <em>E.g., Jones</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/373/index.html">527 U. S. 373</a>, 389.  Social history emphatically reveals an understanding of age discrimination as aimed against the old, and the statutory reference to age discrimination in this idiomatic sense is confirmed by legislative history.  For the very reason that reference to context shows that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cold age\xe2\x80\x9d when teamed with \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7623(f)\xe2\x80\x99s provision of an affirmative defense when age is a bona fide occupational qualification readily shows that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d as a qualification means comparative youth.  As context shows that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d means one thing in \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) and another in \xc2\xa7623(f), so it also demonstrates that the presumption of uniformity cannot sensibly operate here.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Cline\xe2\x80\x99s and the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s second argument\xe2\x80\x94that their view is supported by a colloquy on the Senate floor involving an ADEA sponsor\xe2\x80\x94has more substance than the first, but is still not enough to unsettle this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Senator Yarborough\xe2\x80\x99s view is the only item in all the ADEA hearings, reports, and debates that goes against the grain of the common understanding of age discrimination.  Even from a sponsor, a single outlying statement cannot stand against a tide of context and history, not to mention 30 years of judicial interpretation producing no apparent legislative qualms.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Finally, the argument that the Court owes deference to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading falls short because the EEOC is clearly wrong.  Even for an agency able to claim all the authority possible under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, deference to its statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html">480 U. S. 421</a>, 446.  Here, regular interpretive method leaves no serious question.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d takes on a definite meaning from being in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d occurring as that phrase does in a statute structured and manifestly intended to protect the older from arbitrary favor for the younger.

Respondents (collectively, Cline) were then at least 40 and thus protected by the Act, see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7631(a), but under 50 and so without promise of the benefits.  All of them objected to the new terms, although some had retired before the change in order to get the prior advantage, some retired afterwards with no benefit, and some worked on, knowing the new contract would give them no health coverage when they were through.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) they claimed that the agreement violated the ADEA, because it \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate[d against them] \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to \xe2\x80\xa6 compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of [their] age,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).

In the abstract, the phrase is open to an argument for a broader construction, since reference to \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d carries no express modifier and the word could be read to look two ways.  This more expansive possible understanding does not, however, square with the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination, and in fact Congress\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive clues speak almost unanimously to an understanding of discrimination as directed against workers who are older than the ones getting treated better.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress chose not to include age within discrimination forbidden by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \xc2\xa7715, 78 Stat. 265, being aware that there were legitimate reasons as well as invidious ones for making employment decisions on age.  Instead it called for a study of the issue by the Secretary of Labor, <em>ibid.</em>, who concluded that age discrimination was a serious problem, but one different in kind from discrimination on account of race.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Secretary spoke of disadvantage to older individuals from arbitrary and stereotypical employment distinctions (including then-common policies of age ceilings on hiring), but he examined the problem in light of rational considerations of increased pension cost and, in some cases, legitimate concerns about an older person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do the job.  Wirtz Report 2.  When the Secretary ultimately took the position that arbitrary discrimination against older workers was widespread and persistent enough to call for a federal legislative remedy, <em>id.</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, he placed his recommendation against the background of common experience that the potential cost of employing someone rises with age, so that the older an employee is, the greater the inducement to prefer a younger substitute.  The report contains no suggestion that reactions to age level off at some point, and it was devoid of any indication that the Secretary had noticed unfair advantages accruing to older employees at the expense of their juniors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress then asked for a specific proposal, Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, \xc2\xa7606, 80 Stat. 845, which the Secretary provided in January 1967.  113 Cong. Rec. 1377 (1967); see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson, Vol. 1, Jan. 23, 1967, p.\xc2\xa037 (1968) (message to Congress urging that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]pportunity \xe2\x80\xa6 be opened to the many Americans over 45 who are qualified and willing to work\xe2\x80\x9d).  Extensive House and Senate hearings ensued.  See Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 3651 et\xc2\xa0al. before the General Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter House Hearings); Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on S. 830 and S. 788 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter Senate Hearings).  See generally <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Wyoming,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/226/index.html">460 U. S. 226</a>, 229\xe2\x80\x93233\xc2\xa0(1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The testimony at both hearings dwelled on unjustified assumptions about the effect of age on ability to work.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> House Hearings 151 (statement of Rep. Joshua Eilberg) (\xe2\x80\x9cAt age 40, a worker may find that age restrictions become common \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  By age 45, his employment opportunities are likely to contract sharply; they shrink more severely at age 55 and virtually vanish by age 65\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 422 (statement of Rep. Claude Pepper) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe must provide meaningful opportunities for employment to the thousands of workers 45 and over who are well qualified but nevertheless denied jobs which they may desperately need because someone has arbitrarily decided that they are too old\xe2\x80\x9d); Senate Hearings 34 (statement of Sen. George Murphy) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n older worker often faces an attitude on the part of some employers that prevents him from receiving serious consideration or even an interview in his search for employment\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The hearings specifically addressed higher pension and benefit costs as heavier drags on hiring workers the older they got.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> House Hearings 45 (statement of Norman Sprague) (Apart from stereotypes, \xe2\x80\x9clabor market conditions, seniority and promotion-from-within policies, job training costs, pension and insurance costs, and mandatory retirement policies often make employers reluctant to hire older workers\xe2\x80\x9d).  The record thus reflects the common facts that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s chances to find and keep a job get worse over time; as between any two people, the younger is in the stronger position, the older more apt to be tagged with demeaning stereotype.  Not surprisingly, from the voluminous records of the hearings, we have found (and Cline has cited) nothing suggesting that any workers were registering complaints about discrimination in favor of their seniors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there any such suggestion in the introductory provisions of the ADEA, 81 Stat. 602, which begins with statements of purpose and findings that mirror the Wirtz Report and the committee transcripts.  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa72.  The findings stress the impediments suffered by \xe2\x80\x9colder workers \xe2\x80\xa6 in their efforts to retain \xe2\x80\xa6 and especially to regain employment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa72(a)(1); \xe2\x80\x9cthe [burdens] of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa72(a)(2); the costs of \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise desirable practices [that] may work to the disadvantage of older persons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment[, which] is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa72(a)(3).  The statutory objects were \xe2\x80\x9cto promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and] to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa72(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, except on one point, all the findings and statements of objectives are either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer to \xe2\x80\x9colder\xe2\x80\x9d workers, explicitly or implicitly relative to \xe2\x80\x9cyounger\xe2\x80\x9d ones.  The single subject on which the statute speaks less specifically is that of \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary limits\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary age discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  But these are unmistakable references to the Wirtz Report\xe2\x80\x99s finding that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lmost three out of every five employers covered by [a] 1965 survey have in effect age limitations (most frequently between 45 and 55) on new hires which they apply without consideration of an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s other qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wirtz Report 6.  The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s ban on \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary limits\xe2\x80\x9d thus applies to age caps that exclude older applicants, necessarily to the advantage of younger ones.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such is the setting of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s core substantive provision, \xc2\xa74 (as amended, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623), prohibiting employers and certain others from \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d whenever (as originally enacted) the individual is \xe2\x80\x9cat least forty years of age but less than sixty-five years of age,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa712, 81 Stat. 607.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The prefatory provisions and their legislative history make a case that we think is beyond reasonable doubt, that the ADEA was concerned to protect a relatively old worker from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it remarkable that the record is devoid of any evidence that younger workers were suffering at the expense of their elders, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one.  Common experience is to the contrary, and the testimony, reports, and congressional findings simply confirm that Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d the same way that ordinary people in common usage might speak of age discrimination any day of the week.  One commonplace conception of American society in recent decades is its character as a \xe2\x80\x9cyouth culture,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a world where younger is better, talk about discrimination because of age is naturally understood to refer to discrimination against the older.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This same, idiomatic sense of the statutory phrase is confirmed by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s restriction of the protected class to those 40 and above.  If Congress had been worrying about protecting the younger against the older, it would not likely have ignored everyone under 40.  The youthful deficiencies of inexperience and unsteadiness invite stereotypical and discriminatory thinking about those a lot younger than 40, and prejudice suffered by a 40-year-old is not typically owing to youth, as 40-year-olds sadly tend to find out.  The enemy of 40 is 30, not 50.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 805, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1967) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]estimony indicated [40] to be the age at which age discrimination in employment becomes evident\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even so, the 40-year threshold was adopted over the objection that some discrimination against older people begins at an even younger age; female flight attendants were not fired at 32 because they were too young, <em>ibid.</em>  See also Senate Hearings 47 (statement of Sec\xe2\x80\x99y Wirtz) (lowering the minimum age limit \xe2\x80\x9cwould change the nature of the proposal from an over-age employment discrimination measure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the 40-year threshold makes sense as identifying a class requiring protection against preference for their juniors, not as defining a class that might be threatened by favoritism toward seniors.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal reports are as replete with cases taking this position as they are nearly devoid of decisions like the one reviewed here.  To start closest to home, the best example is <em>Hazen Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Biggins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/604/index.html">507 U. S. 604</a> (1993), in which we held there is no violation of the ADEA in firing an employee because his pension is about to vest, a basis for action that we took to be analytically distinct from age, even though it would never occur without advanced years.  <em>Id.</em>, at 611\xe2\x80\x93612.  We said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe very essence of age discrimination [is] for an older employee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with old age,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 610, whereas discrimination on the basis of pension status \xe2\x80\x9cwould not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age [because t]he prohibited stereotype [of the faltering worker] would not have figured in this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 612.  And we have relied on this same reading of the statute in other cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, 517 U. S., at 313 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age \xe2\x80\xa6 the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a \xe2\x80\xa6 reliable indicator of age discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Western Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Criswell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/400/index.html">472 U. S. 400</a>, 409 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legislative history of the ADEA \xe2\x80\xa6 repeatedly emphasize[s that] the process of psychological and physiological degeneration caused by aging varies with each individual\xe2\x80\x9d).  While none of these cases directly addresses the question presented here, all of them show our consistent understanding that the text, structure, and history point to the ADEA as a remedy for unfair preference based on relative youth, leaving complaints of the relatively young outside the statutory concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals and the District Courts have read the law the same way, and prior to this case have enjoyed virtually unanimous accord in understanding the ADEA to forbid only discrimination preferring young to old.  So<font b="1"> the Seventh Circuit held in <em>Hamilton</em>, and the First Circuit said in <em>Schuler</em>, and so the District Courts have ruled in cases too numerous for citation here in the text.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The very strength of this consensus is enough to rule out any serious claim of ambiguity, and congressional silence after years of judicial interpretation supports adherence to the traditional view.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cline and <em>amicus</em> EEOC proffer three rejoinders in favor of their competing view that the prohibition works both ways.  First, they say (as does Justice Thomas, <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934) that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is plain when the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d receives its natural and ordinary meaning and the statute is read as a whole giving \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d the same meaning throughout.  And even if the text does not plainly mean what they say it means, they argue that the soundness of their version is shown by a colloquy on the floor of the Senate involving Senator Yarborough, a sponsor of the bill that became the ADEA.  Finally, they fall back to the position (fortified by Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent) that we should defer to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute.  On each point, however, we think the argument falls short of unsettling our view of the natural meaning of the phrase speaking of discrimination, read in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s manifest purpose.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first response to our reading is the dictionary argument that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d means the length of a person\xe2\x80\x99s life, with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d stating a simple test of causation: \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d is treatment that would not have occurred if the individual\xe2\x80\x99s span of years had been longer or shorter.  The case for this reading calls attention to the other instances of \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d in the ADEA that are not limited to old age, such as 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(f), which gives an employer a defense to charges of age discrimination when \xe2\x80\x9cage is a bona fide occupational qualification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cline and the EEOC argue that if \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d meant old age, \xc2\xa7623(f) would then provide a defense (old age is a bona fide qualification) only for an employer\xe2\x80\x99s action that on our reading would never clash with the statute (because preferring the older is not forbidden).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument rests on two mistakes.  First, it assumes that the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d has the same meaning wherever the ADEA uses it.  But this is not so, and Cline simply misemploys the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932).  Cline forgets that \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/200/index.html">532 U. S. 200</a>, 213 (2001) (phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwages paid\xe2\x80\x9d has different meanings in different parts of Title 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.); <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/337/index.html">519 U. S. 337</a>, 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (1997) (term \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d has different meanings in different parts of Title VII).  The presumption of uniform usage thus relents[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] when a word used has several commonly understood meanings among which a speaker can alternate in the course of an ordinary conversation, without being confused or getting confusing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAge\xe2\x80\x9d is that kind of word.  As Justice Thomas (<em>post</em>, at 2) agrees, the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone can be readily understood either as pointing to any number of years lived, or as common shorthand for the longer span and concurrent aches that make youth look good.  Which alternative was probably intended is a matter of context; we understand the different choices of meaning that lie behind a sentence like \xe2\x80\x9cAge can be shown by a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license,\xe2\x80\x9d and the statement, \xe2\x80\x9cAge has left him a shut-in.\xe2\x80\x9d  So it is easy to understand that Congress chose different meanings at different places in the ADEA, as the different settings readily show.  Hence the second flaw in Cline\xe2\x80\x99s argument for uniform usage: it ignores the cardinal rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatutory language must be read in context [since] a phrase \xe2\x80\x98gathers meaning from the words around it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/373/index.html">527 U. S. 373</a>, 389 (1999) (quoting <em>Jarecki</em> v. <em>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/303/index.html">367 U. S. 303</a>, 307 (1961)).  The point here is that we are not asking an abstract question about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d; we are seeking the meaning of the whole phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d where it occurs in the ADEA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  As we have said, social history emphatically reveals an understanding of age discrimination as aimed against the old, and the statutory reference to age discrimination in this idiomatic sense is confirmed by legislative history.  For the very reason that reference to context shows that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cold age\xe2\x80\x9d when teamed with \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d the provision of an affirmative defense when age is a bona fide occupational qualification readily shows that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d as a qualification means comparative youth.  As context tells us that \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d means one thing in \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) and another in \xc2\xa7623(f),[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] so it also tells us that the presumption of uniformity cannot sensibly operate here.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The comparisons Justice Thomas urges, <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9312, to <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/273/index.html"></a><a href="/us/427/273/index.html">427 U. S. 273</a> (1976), and <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html"></a><a href="/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a> (1998), serve to clarify our position.  Both cases involved Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq.</em>, and its prohibition on employment discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s <em>race</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 [or] <em>sex</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d employed by the ADEA is not, however, comparable to the terms \xe2\x80\x9crace\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csex\xe2\x80\x9d employed by Title VII.  \xe2\x80\x9cRace\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csex\xe2\x80\x9d are general terms that in every day usage require modifiers to indicate any relatively narrow application.  We do not commonly understand \xe2\x80\x9crace\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to the black race, or \xe2\x80\x9csex\xe2\x80\x9d to refer only to the female.  But the prohibition of age discrimination is readily read more narrowly than analogous provisions dealing with race and sex.  That narrower reading is the more natural one in the textual setting, and it makes perfect sense because of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated concern with distinctions that hurt older people.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second objection has more substance than the first, but still not enough.  The record of congressional action reports a colloquy on the Senate floor between two of the legislators most active in pushing for the ADEA, Senators Javits and Yarborough.  Senator Javits began the exchange by raising a concern mentioned by Senator Dominick, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe bill might not forbid discrimination between two persons each of whom would be between the ages of 40 and 65.\xe2\x80\x9d  113 Cong. Rec. 31255 (1967).  Senator Javits then gave his own view that, \xe2\x80\x9cif two individuals ages 52 and 42 apply for the same job, and the employer selected the man aged 42 solely \xe2\x80\xa6 because he is younger than the man 52, then he will have violated the act,\xe2\x80\x9d and asked Senator Yarborough for his opinion.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Senator Yarborough answered that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he law prohibits age being a factor in the decision to hire, as to one age over the other, whichever way [the] decision went.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although in the past we have given weight to Senator Yarborough\xe2\x80\x99s views on the construction of the ADEA because he was a sponsor, see, e.g., Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio </em>v. <em>Betts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/158/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/158/index.html">492 U. S. 158</a>, 179 (1989), his side of this exchange is not enough to unsettle our reading of the statute.

What matters is that the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s remark, \xe2\x80\x9cwhichever way [the] decision went,\xe2\x80\x9d is the only item in all the 1967 hearings, reports, and debates going against the grain of the common understanding of age discrimination.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Even from a sponsor, a single outlying statement cannot stand against a tide of context and history, not to mention 30 years of judicial interpretation producing no apparent legislative qualms.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7621\xe2\x80\x93634, makes it unlawful for an employer to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  The question in this case is whether, in the absence of an affirmative defense, the ADEA prohibits an employer from favoring older over younger workers when both are protected by the Act, <em>i.e.</em>, are 40 years of age or older.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has answered this question in the affirmative.  In 1981, the agency adopted a regulation which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unlawful in situations where this Act applies, for an employer to discriminate in hiring or in any other way by giving preference because of age between individuals 40 and over.  Thus, if two people apply for the same position, and one is 42 and the other 52, the employer may not lawfully turn down either one on the basis of age, but must make such decision on the basis of some other factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 C.F.R. \xc2\xa71625.2(a) (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis regulation represents the interpretation of the agency tasked by Congress with enforcing the ADEA.

It is evident, for the reasons given in Part II of Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive method is anything but \xe2\x80\x9cregular.\xe2\x80\x9d  And for the reasons given in Part I of that opinion, the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is neither foreclosed by the statute nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7623(a) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not unambiguously require a different interpretation, and . . . the [EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s] regulation is an entirely reasonable interpretation of the text,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 540 U.

The plain language of 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) mandates a particular outcome: that the respondents are able to sue for discrimination against them in favor of older workers.  The agency charged with enforcing the statute has adopted a regulation and issued an opinion as an adjudicator, both of which adopt this natural interpretation of the provision.  And the only portion of legislative history relevant to the question before us is consistent with this outcome.  Despite the fact that these traditional tools of statutory interpretation lead inexorably to the conclusion that respondents can state a claim for discrimination against the relatively young, the Court, apparently disappointed by this result, today adopts a different interpretation.  In doing so, the Court, of necessity, creates a new tool of statutory interpretation, and then proceeds to give this newly created \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d analysis dispositive weight.  Because I cannot agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new approach to interpreting anti-discrimination statutes, I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe starting point for [the] interpretation of a statute is always its language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence</em> v. <em>Reid,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/730/index.html">490 U.

Thus, rather than looking through the historical background of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), I would instead start with the text of \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) itself, and if \xe2\x80\x9cthe words of [the] statute are unambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d my \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial inquiry [would be] complete.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 254 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain language of the ADEA clearly allows for suits brought by the relatively young when discriminated against in favor of the relatively old.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1), is not restricted to discrimination because of relatively <em>older</em> age.  If an employer fired a worker for the sole reason that the worker was under 45, it would be entirely natural to say that the worker had been discriminated against because of his age.  I struggle to think of what other phrase I would use to describe such behavior.  I wonder how the Court would describe such incidents, because the Court apparently considers such usage to be unusual, atypical, or aberrant.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon usage of language\xe2\x80\x9d would exclude discrimination against the relatively young from the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion] \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties do identify a possible ambiguity, centering on the multiple meanings of the word \xe2\x80\x9cage.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the parties note, \xe2\x80\x9cage,\xe2\x80\x9d does have an alternative meaning, namely \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he state of being old; old age.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Heritage Dictionary 33 (3d ed. 1992); see also Oxford American Dictionary 18 (1999); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 40 (1993).  First, this secondary meaning is, of course, less commonly used than the primary meaning, and appears restricted to those few instances where it is clear in the immediate context of the phrase that it could have no other meaning.  The phrases \xe2\x80\x9chair white with age,\xe2\x80\x9d American Heritage Dictionary, <em>supra,</em> at 33, or <em>\xe2\x80\x9ceyes \xe2\x80\xa6 dim with age,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Random House Dictionary of the English Language 37 (2d ed. 1987), cannot possibly be using \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cyoung age,\xe2\x80\x9d unlike a phrase such as \xe2\x80\x9che fired her because of her age.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d in other portions of the statute effectively destroys any doubt.  The ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s advertising prohibition, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(e), and the bona fide occupational qualification defense, \xc2\xa7623(f)(1), would both be rendered incoherent if the term \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d in those provisions were read to mean only \xe2\x80\x9colder age.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Although it is true that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9crigid\xe2\x80\x9d and can be overcome when the context is clear, <em>ante</em>, at 12 (quoting <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/index.html">286 U. S. 427</a>, 433 (1932)), the presumption is not rebutted here.  As noted, the plain and common reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csuch individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s chronological age.  At the very least, it is manifestly unclear that it bars <em>only</em> discrimination against the relatively older.  Only by incorrectly concluding that \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) clearly and unequivocally bars only discrimination as \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the older,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, can the Court then conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(f)(1) and 623(e) allows for an alternative  meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The one structural argument raised by the Court in defense of its interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d is the provision limiting the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s protections to those over 40 years of age.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7631(a).  At first glance, this might look odd when paired with the conclusion that \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) bars discrimination against the relatively young as well as the relatively old, but there is a perfectly rational explanation.  Congress could easily conclude that age discrimination directed against those under 40 is not as damaging, since a young worker unjustly fired is likely to find a new job or otherwise recover from the discrimination.  A person over 40 fired due to irrational age discrimination (whether because the worker is too young or too old) might have a more difficult time recovering from the discharge and finding new employment.  Such an interpretation also comports with the many findings of the Wirtz report, United States Dept. of Labor, The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment (1965), and the parallel findings in the ADEA itself.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7621(a)(1) (finding that \xe2\x80\x9colder workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7621(a)(3) (finding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This plain reading of the ADEA is bolstered by the interpretation of the agency charged with administering the statute.  A regulation issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) adopts the view contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, 29 CFR \xc2\xa71625.2(a) (2003), and the only binding EEOC decision that addresses the question before us also adopted the view contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s, see <em>Garrett</em> v. <em>Runyon</em>, Appeal No. 01960422, 1997 WL 574739, <font super="1">*1 (EEOC, Sept. 5, 1997).  I agree with the Court that we need not address whether deference under <em>Chevron</em> <em>U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984), would apply to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation in this case.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Of course, I so conclude because the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is consistent with the best reading of the statute.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s position, on the other hand, is untenable.  Even if the Court disagrees with my interpretation of the language of the statute, it strains credulity to argue that such a reading is so unreasonable that an agency could not adopt it.  To suggest that, in the instant case, the \xe2\x80\x9cregular interpretive method leaves no serious question, not even about purely textual ambiguity in the ADEA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, is to ignore the entirely reasonable (and, incidentally, correct) contrary interpretation of the ADEA that the EEOC and I advocate.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the only relevant piece of legislative history addressing the question before the Court\xe2\x80\x94whether it would be possible for a younger individual to sue based on discrimination against him in favor of an older individual\xe2\x80\x94comports with the plain reading of the text.  Senator Yarborough, in the only exchange that the parties identified from the legislative history discussing this particular question, confirmed that the text really meant what it said.  See 113 Cong. Rec. 31255 (1967).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Although the statute is clear, and hence there is no need to delve into the legislative history, this history merely confirms that the plain reading of the text is correct.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Strangely, the Court does not explain why it departs from accepted methods of interpreting statutes.  It does, however, clearly set forth its principal reason for adopting its particular reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate \xe2\x80\xa6 based on [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d in Part III\xe2\x80\x93A of its opinion.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe point here,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court states, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we are not asking in the abstract how the ADEA uses the word \xe2\x80\x98age,\xe2\x80\x99 but seeking the meaning of the whole phrase \xe2\x80\x98discriminate \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x99  As we have said, <em>social history</em> emphatically points to the sense of age discrimination as aimed against the old, and this idiomatic understanding is confirmed by legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  The Court does not define \xe2\x80\x9csocial history,\xe2\x80\x9d although it is apparently something different from legislative history, because the Court refers to legislative history as a separate interpretive tool in the very same sentence.  Indeed, the Court has never defined \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d in any previous opinion, probably because it has never sanctioned looking to \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d as a method of statutory interpretation.  Today, the Court takes this unprecedented step, and then places dispositive weight on the new concept.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It appears that the Court considers the \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate \xe2\x80\xa6 because of [an] individual\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d to be the principal evil that Congress targeted when it passed the ADEA.  In each section of its analysis, the Court pointedly notes that there was no evidence of widespread problems of antiyouth discrimination, and that the primary concerns of Executive Branch officials and Members of Congress pertained to problems that workers generally faced as they increased in age.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court reaches its final, legal conclusion as to the meaning of the phrase (that \xe2\x80\x9cordinary people employing the common usage of language\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9ctalk about discrimination because of age [as] naturally [referring to] discrimination against the older,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>) only after concluding both that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ADEA was concerned to protect a relatively old worker from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is \xe2\x80\xa6 no record indication that younger workers were suffering at the expense of their elders, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hence, the Court apparently concludes that if Congress has in mind a particular, principal, or primary form of discrimination when it passes an antidiscrimination provision prohibit-\ning persons from \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminating because of [some personal quality],\xe2\x80\x9d then the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate because of [some personal quality]\xe2\x80\x9d only covers the principal or most common form of discrimination relating to this personal quality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, has not typically interpreted nondiscrimination statutes in this odd manner.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79 (1998).  The oddity of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new technique of statutory interpretation is highlighted by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary approach to the racial-discrimination prohibition of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is little doubt that the motivation behind the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to prevent invidious discrimination against racial minorities, especially blacks.  See 110 Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (statement of Sen. Humphrey) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe goals of this bill are simple ones: To extend to Negro citizens the same rights and the same opportunities that white Americans take for granted\xe2\x80\x9d).  President Kennedy, in announcing his Civil Rights proposal, identified several social problems, such as how a \xe2\x80\x9cNegro baby born in America today \xe2\x80\xa6 has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby \xe2\x80\xa6 one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, \xe2\x80\xa6 and the prospects of earning only half as much.\xe2\x80\x9d  Radio and Television Report to the American People on Civil Rights, Public Papers of the Presidents, John F. Kennedy, No. 237, June, 11, 1963, pp.\xc2\xa0468\xe2\x80\x93469 (1964).  He gave no examples, and cited no occurrences, of discrimination against whites or indicated that such discrimination motivated him (even in part) to introduce the bill.  Considered by some to be the impetus for the submission of a Civil Rights bill to Congress,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the 1961 Civil Rights Commission Report focused its employment section solely on discrimination against racial minorities, noting, for instance that the \xe2\x80\x9ctwin problems\xe2\x80\x9d of unemployment and a lack of skilled workers \xe2\x80\x9care magnified for minority groups that are subject to discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 U. S. Commission on Civil Rights Report 1 (1961).  It also discussed and analyzed the more severe unemployment statistics of black workers compared to white workers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934; see also <em>id.</em>, at 153 (summarizing findings of the Commission, listing examples only of discrimination against blacks).  The report presented no evidence of any problems (or even any incidents) of discrimination against whites.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The congressional debates and hearings, although filled with statements decrying discrimination against racial minorities and setting forth the disadvantages those minorities suffered, contain no references that I could find to any problem of discrimination against whites.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 110 Cong. Rec. 7204 (1964) (statement of Sen. Clark) (\xe2\x80\x9cI turn now to the background of racial discrimination in the job market, which is the basis for the need for this legislation.  I suggest that economics is at the heart of racial bias.  The Negro has been condemned to poverty because of lack of equal job opportunities.  This poverty has kept the Negro out of the mainstream of American life\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 7379 (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII is directed toward what, in my judgment, American Negroes need most to increase their health and happiness\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [T]o be deprived of the chance to make a decent living and of the income needed to bring up children is a family tragedy\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 6547 (statement of Sen. Humphrey) (\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to turn now to the problem of racial discrimination in employment.  At the present time Negroes and members of other minority groups do not have an equal chance to be hired, to be promoted, and to be given the most desirable assignments\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid</em>. (citing disfavorable unemployment rates of nonwhites as compared to whites); <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cDiscrimination in employment is not confined to any region\xe2\x80\x94it is widespread in every part of the country.  It is harmful to Negroes and to members of other minority groups\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 6548 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe crux of the problem is to open employment opportunities for Negroes in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 6562 (statement of Sen.

And if a member of a so-called minority group believes that no matter how hard he studies, he will be confronted with a life of unskilled and menial labor, then a loss has occurred, not only for a human being, but also for our Nation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id., </em>at 6748 (statement of Sen. Moss) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us, that is except the person who is discriminated against on the basis of race, color, or national origin \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  He frequently knows that he is not going to school to prepare for a job\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  He frequently knows that no matter how hard he works, how diligently he turns up day after day, how much overtime he puts in, that he will never get to be the boss of a single work crew or the foreman of a single division.  And that is what the fair employment practices title is about\xe2\x80\x94not the right to displace a white man or be given preference over him\xe2\x80\x94but simply the right to be in the running\xe2\x80\x9d).  I find no evidence that even a single legislator appeared concerned about whether there were incidents of discrimination against whites, and I find no citation to any such incidents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, there is no record evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat [white] workers were suffering at the expense of [racial minorities],\xe2\x80\x9d and in 1964, discrimination against whites in favor of racial minorities was hardly \xe2\x80\x9ca social problem requir[ing] a federal statute to place a [white] worker in parity with [racial minorities].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9ctalk about discrimination because of [race] [would] naturally [be] understood to refer to discrimination against [racial minorities].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today, it appears that this Court has been treading down the wrong path with respect to Title VII since at least 1976.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See <em>McDonald</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/273/index.html">427 U. S. 273</a> (1976) (holding that Title VII protected whites discriminated against in favor of racial minorities).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>McDonald</em>, the Court relied on the fact that the terms of Title VII, prohibiting the discharge of \xe2\x80\x9cany individual\xe2\x80\x9d because of \xe2\x80\x9csuch individual\xe2\x80\x99s race,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x93\n2(a)(1), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are not limited to discrimination against\nmembers of any particular race.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  427 U. S., at 278\xe2\x80\x93279.  Admittedly, the Court there also relied on the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Title VII as given in its decisions, <em>id</em>., at 279\xe2\x80\x93280, and also on statements from the legislative history of the enactment of Title VII.  See <em>id</em>., at 280 (citing 110 Cong. Rec., at 2578 (remarks of Rep. Celler); <em>id</em>., at 7218 (memorandum of Sen. Clark); <em>id</em>., at 7213 (memorandum of Sens. Clark and Case); <em>id</em>., at 8912 (remarks of Sen. Williams)).  But, in the instant case, as I have already noted above, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, the EEOC has issued a regulation and a binding EEOC decision adopting the view contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s and in line with the interpretation of Title VII.  And, again as already noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 6, the only relevant piece of legislative history with respect to the question before the Court is in the same posture as the legislative history behind Title VII: namely, a statement that age discrimination cuts both ways and a relatively younger individual could sue when discriminated against.  See 113 Cong. Rec., at 31255 (statement of Sen. Yarborough).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is abundantly clear, then, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new approach to antidiscrimination statutes would lead us far astray from well-settled principles of statutory interpretation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s examination of \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d is in serious tension (if not outright conflict) with our prior cases in such matters.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s current approach, for instance, <em>McDonald </em>and <em>Oncale[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</em> are wrongly decided.  One can only hope that this new technique of statutory interpretation does not catch on, and that its errors are limited to only this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to this dissent, the Court insists that it is not making this \xe2\x80\x9cparticular mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cconfining the application of terms used in a broad sense to the relatively narrow class of cases that prompted Congress to address their subject matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 n.\xc2\xa05.  It notes that, in contrast to the term \xe2\x80\x9cage,\xe2\x80\x9d the terms \xe2\x80\x9crace\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csex\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral terms that in every day usage require modifiers to indicate any relatively narrow application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  The Court, thus, seems to claim that it is merely trying to identify whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe narrower reading\xe2\x80\x9d of the term \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe more natural one in the textual setting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</em>  But the Court does not seriously attempt to analyze whether the term \xe2\x80\x9cage\xe2\x80\x9d is more naturally read narrowly in the context of \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  Instead, the Court jumps immediately to, and rests its entire \xe2\x80\x9ccommon usage\xe2\x80\x9d analysis, <em>ante</em>, at 8, on, the \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole phrase \xe2\x80\x98discriminate . . . because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  In other words, the Court concludes that the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon usage\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cage discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d refers exclusively to discrimination against the relatively old <em>only because</em> the \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase as a whole mandates such a reading.  As I have explained here, the \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole phrase \xe2\x80\x98discriminate . . . because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> found in \xc2\xa7623(a)(1) is no different than the \xe2\x80\x9csocial history\xe2\x80\x9d of the whole phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate . . . because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.
