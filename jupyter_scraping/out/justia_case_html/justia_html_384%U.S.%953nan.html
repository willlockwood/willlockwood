The second record is a transcription of passages from \'Songs of Bilitis,\' a book of poems published by Pierre Louys in 1894. Pierre Louys was a French poet and novelist who lived from 1870 to 1925. The Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature2 says that his poems \'by their grace, by that clear imagery characteristic of the Parnassian school and by their pure and flexible harmony of style may well become immortal; indeed few poets have ever had a more fervent worship of beauty and a more profound respect for form. The works of Louys have inspired several musicians, among whom the most notable is Clause Debussy. ...\'</ul> <ul>\'Under the First Amendment this conviction cannot stand.
