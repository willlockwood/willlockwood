S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3).  In a related suit, the District Court found that Saint-Gobain violated the Act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing work-related protective gear.  In this suit Kasten claims that he was discharged because he orally complained to company officials about the timeclocks.  The District Court granted Saint-Gobain summary judgment, concluding that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision did not cover oral complaints.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The scope of statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d includes oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The interpretation of the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the [statute\xe2\x80\x99s] purpose and context \xe2\x80\xa6 , and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486.  The text, taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer here.  Some dictionary definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d contemplate a writing while others permit using \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d in conjunction with oral material.  In addition to dictionary definitions, state statutes and federal regulations sometimes contemplate oral filings, and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  Even if \xe2\x80\x9cfiled,\xe2\x80\x9d considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> complaint\xe2\x80\x9d suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.  Thus, the three-word phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s other references to \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d also do not resolve the linguistic question.  Some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually always in writing; others specifically require a writing, and the remainder, like the provision here, leave the oral/written question unresolved.  Since \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d lends itself linguistically to the broader, \xe2\x80\x9coral\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation, the use of broader language in other statutes\xe2\x80\x99 antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether Congress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.  Because the text, taken alone, might, or might not, encompass oral complaints, the Court must look further.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Several functional considerations indicate that Congress intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0A narrow interpretation would undermine the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic objective, which is to prohibit \xe2\x80\x9clabor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7202(a).  The Act relies for enforcement of its substantive standards on \xe2\x80\x9cinformation and complaints received from employees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/288/index.html">361 U. S. 288</a>, 292, and its antiretaliation provision makes the enforcement scheme effective by preventing \xe2\x80\x9cfear of economic retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d from inducing workers \xe2\x80\x9cquietly to accept substandard conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement scheme\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly the illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers who were most in need of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s help at the time of passage?  Limiting the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope to written complaints could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods to receive complaints.  And insofar as the provision covers complaints made to employers, a limiting reading would discourage using informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.  The National Labor Relations Act\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision has been broadly interpreted as protecting workers who simply \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Scrivener</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/117/index.html">405 U. S. 117</a>, 123.  The similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for a broad interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an employer receive fair notice of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s complaint can be met by oral, as well as written, complaints.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies, their views about the meaning of the phrase should be given a degree of weight.  The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view that \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d covers both oral and written complaints.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has set out a similar view in its Compliance Manual and in multiple briefs.  These views are reasonable and consistent with the Act.  And the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>post hoc</em> rationalizatio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201 <em>et seq</em>.  The Act contains an antiretaliation provision that forbids employers</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has <em>filed any complaint</em> or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to [the Act], or has testified or is about to testify in such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe must decide whether the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d includes oral as well as written complaints within its scope.  We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petitioner, Kevin Kasten, brought this antiretaliation lawsuit against his former employer, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation.  Kasten says that Saint-Gobain located its timeclocks between the area where Kasten and other workers put on (and take off) their work-related protective gear and the area where they carry out their assigned tasks.  That location prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent putting on and taking off their work clothes\xe2\x80\x94contrary to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  In a related suit the District Court agreed with Kasten, finding that Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpractice of not compensating \xe2\x80\xa6 for time spent donning and doffing certain required protective gear and walking to work areas\xe2\x80\x9d violated the Act.  <em>Kasten</em> v. <em>Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.</em>, 556 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 941, 954 (WD Wis. 2008).  In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retaliation.  He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because he orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the timeclocks.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the unlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xe2\x80\x94in accordance with Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s internal grievance-resolution procedure.  See Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as imposing upon every employee \xe2\x80\x9cthe responsibility to report \xe2\x80\xa6 suspected violations of \xe2\x80\xa6 any applicable law of which he or she becomes aware\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (quoting Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s Employee Policy Handbook as instructing employees with \xe2\x80\x9cquestions, complaints, and problems\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontact\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9csupervisor[s] immediately\xe2\x80\x9d and if necessary \xe2\x80\x9ctake the issue to the next level of management,\xe2\x80\x9d then to the \xe2\x80\x9clocal Human Resources Manager,\xe2\x80\x9d then to \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Resources\xe2\x80\x9d personnel at the \xe2\x80\x9cRegional\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHeadquarters\xe2\x80\x9d level).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kasten adds that he \xe2\x80\x9craised a concern\xe2\x80\x9d with his shift supervisor that \xe2\x80\x9cit was illegal for the time clocks to be where they were\xe2\x80\x9d because of Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe time you come in and start doing stuff\xe2\x80\x9d; he told a human resources employee that \xe2\x80\x9cif they were to get challenged on\xe2\x80\x9d the location in court, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would lose\xe2\x80\x9d; he told his lead operator that the location was illegal and that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas thinking about starting a lawsuit about the placement of the time clocks\xe2\x80\x9d; and he told the human resources manager and the operations manager that he thought the location was illegal and that the company would \xe2\x80\x9close\xe2\x80\x9d in court.

This activity, Kasten concludes, led the company to discipline him and, in December 2006, to dismiss him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events.  It denies that Kasten made any significant complaint about the timeclock location.  And it says that it dismissed Kasten simply because Kasten, after being repeatedly warned, failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For present purposes we accept Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s version of these contested events as valid.  See <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 380 (2007).  That is because the District Court entered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  619 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008).  And it did so, not because it doubted Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prove the facts he alleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect <em>oral </em>complaints.  <em>Id.</em>, at 611\xe2\x80\x93613.  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d 834, 838\xe2\x80\x93840 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kasten sought certiorari.  And in light of conflict among the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected, we granted Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  Compare <em>Hagan</em> v. <em>Echostar Satellite, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d 617, 625\xe2\x80\x93626 (CA5 2008) (antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints); <em>Lambert</em> v. <em>Ackerley</em>, 180 F.\xc2\xa03d 997, 1007 (CA9 1999) (en banc) (same); with <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Genesee Hospital</em>, 10 F.\xc2\xa03d 46, 55\xe2\x80\x9356 (CA2 1993) (antiretaliation provision does not cover informal complaints to supervisors).

The Act protects employees who have \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3), and interpretation of this phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>Postal Service</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/481/index.html">546 U. S. 481</a>, 486 (2006).  This analysis leads us to conclude that the language of the provision, considered in isolation, may be open to competing interpretations.  But considering the provision in conjunction with the purpose and context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is permissible.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the text of the statute.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d has different relevant meanings in different contexts.  Some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a writing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver <em>(a paper or instrument)</em> to the proper officer so that it is received by him to be kept on file, or among the records of his office\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cto place among official records as prescribed by law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But other dictionaries provide different definitions that permit the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d in conjunction with oral material.  One can, for example, file an oral statement that enters a matter \xe2\x80\x9cinto the order of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to \xe2\x80\x9cpresent in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so that it shall go upon the records or into the order of business\xe2\x80\x9d).  This possibility is significant because it means that dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not <em>necessarily </em>limit the scope of the statutory phrase to written complaints.  Cf.<em> Crawford</em> v. <em>Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson Cty.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5) (looking for the \xe2\x80\x9climits\xe2\x80\x9d of a linguistic phrase rather than what \xe2\x80\x9cexemplif[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d its application).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found that legislators, administrators, and judges have all sometimes used the word \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d in conjunction with oral statements.  Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral filings.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa747.32.090(a) (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cfile a verbal or written complaint\xe2\x80\x9d); Cal.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ritter</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 28 F.\xc2\xa02d 265, 267 (CA3 1928) (finding words \xe2\x80\x9cfile a claim for refund\xe2\x80\x9d to require a written request in context of tax code).  But we are interested in the filing of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  So even if the word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled,\xe2\x80\x9d considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> complaint\xe2\x80\x9d suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Republic of Iraq</em> v. <em>Beaty</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7).  The upshot is that the three-word phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can look further to other appearances of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act.  See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/218/index.html">512 U. S. 218</a>, 226 (1994) (examining \xe2\x80\x9ccontextual indications\xe2\x80\x9d of the meaning of a term).  That word (or a variant) appears in numerous other provisions.  But its appearance elsewhere in the Act does not resolve the linguistic question before us.  Some of those other provisions (1) involve filed material that, unlike a complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in writing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(<em>l</em>) (employers must \xe2\x80\x9chave on file <em>an unexpired certificate</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa7210(a) (Secretary must \xe2\x80\x9cfile in the court <em>the record of the\xc2\xa0industry committee\xe2\x80\x9d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>ibid.</em> (industry committee must \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d its findings and recommendations).  Others (2) specifically require a writing, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconsent <em>in</em> <em>writing</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to join collective action to be \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa7216(b) (same).  And the remainder (3) leave the oral/\nwritten question unresolved\xe2\x80\x94just as does the provision before us.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless movant \xe2\x80\x9cfile[s] in court an <em>undertaking</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa7214(c)(5)(A) (employee \xe2\x80\x9cmay file \xe2\x80\xa6 a <em>petition</em>\xe2\x80\x9d for review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that contain antiretaliation provisions.  Those statutes, however, use somewhat different language.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has \xe2\x80\x9cfiled charges or given testimony\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7623(d) (protecting those who\n\xe2\x80\x9c<em>opposed</em> any [unlawful] practice\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 42\xc2\xa0U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72615(a)(2) (similar).  See also, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72087(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>provided</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 to the employer \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>information</em> relating to any violation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa72651(a) (similar); 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7815(c)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cfiled <em>or made</em> a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75851(a)(1)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>notified</em> his employer\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742121(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>provided</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>information</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa760129(a)(1) (same).  Some of this language is broader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the broader, \xe2\x80\x9coral\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation, the use of broader language elsewhere <em>may </em>mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the scope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Congress did not believe the different phraseology made a significant difference in this respect.  The language alone does not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect orally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d might, or might not, encompass oral complaints.  We must look further.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several functional considerations indicate that Congress intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written, \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  First, an interpretation that limited the provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to written complaints would undermine the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic objectives.  The Act seeks to prohibit \xe2\x80\x9clabor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7202(a).  It does so in part by setting forth substantive wage, hour, and overtime standards.  It relies for enforcement of these standards, not upon \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing detailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,\xe2\x80\x9d but upon \xe2\x80\x9cinformation and complaints received from employees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/288/index.html">361 U. S. 288</a>, 292 (1960).  And its antiretaliation provision makes this enforcement scheme effective by preventing \xe2\x80\x9cfear of economic retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d from inducing workers \xe2\x80\x9cquietly to accept substandard conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement scheme\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers?  President Franklin Roosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the workers most in need of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s help.  See Message to Congress, May 24, 1937, H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of \xe2\x80\x9cthose who toil in factory\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy rates were particularly high among the poor.  See E. Gordon &amp; E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one-quarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample Statistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8% of manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years of schooling).  Those rates remained high in certain industries for many years after the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  In 1948, for example, the National War Labor Board wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn many plants where there is a high degree of illiteracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a substantial hardship.  In other plants where there is considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it is often not practicable to write up grievances during work hours.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 The Termination Report of the National War Labor Board, p. 122.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the filing of written complaints would also take needed flexibility from those charged with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.  It could prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods of receiving complaints.  And insofar as the antiretaliation provision covers complaints made to employers (a matter we need not decide, see infra, </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315), it would discourage the use of desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act.  Cf. <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a>, 764 (1998) (reading Title VII to encourage the development of effective grievance procedures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, &amp; K. Rogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38\xe2\x80\x9340 (1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten complaints).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the need for effective enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly interpreted the language of the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfiled charges or given testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7158(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x94as protecting workers who <em>neither </em>filed charges <em>nor</em> were \xe2\x80\x9ccalled <em>formally</em> to testify\xe2\x80\x9d but simply \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate[d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Scrivener</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/117/index.html">405 U. S. 117</a>, 123 (1972) (emphasis added).  The similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d that would provide \xe2\x80\x9cbroad rather than narrow protection to the employee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 122 (and would do so here without pressing statutory language to its limit).  See also <em>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co.</em> v. <em>Muscoda Local No. 123</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/590/index.html">321 U. S. 590</a>, 597 (1944) (the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cremedial and humanitarian \xe2\x80\xa6 purpose\xe2\x80\x9d cautions against \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow, grudging\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations of its language).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the only relevant statutory objective.  The Act also seeks to establish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.  To do so, the employer must have fair notice that an employee is making a complaint that could subject the employer to a later claim of retaliation.  If oral complaints suffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee (particularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the moment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act violation or just letting off steam.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Saint-Gobain that the statute requires fair notice.  Although the dictionary definitions, statutes, regulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x937, do not distinguish between writings and oral statements, they do suggest that a \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d is a serious occasion, rather than a triviality.  As such, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d contemplates some degree of formality, certainly to the point where the recipient has been given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and does, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part of its business concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the statute prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee \xe2\x80\x9c<em>because</em> such employee has filed any complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) (emphasis added).  And it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or should not) know an employee has made a complaint could discriminate <em>because </em>of that complaint.  But we also believe that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily mean that notice must be in writing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At oral argument, the Government said that a complaint is \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee\xe2\x80\x9d to have \xe2\x80\x9cput the employer on notice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights under the [Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26.  We agree.  To fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.  This standard can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by written ones.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies, we also give a degree of weight to their views about the meaning of this enforcement language. See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(c) (vesting enforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71, p. 664 (transferring to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its Equal Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140 (1944) (giving weight to a persuasive articulation of views within an agency\xe2\x80\x99s area of expertise).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view that the words \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d cover oral, as well as written, complaints.  The Department of Labor articulated that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago, <em>Goldberg</em> v. <em>Zenger</em>, 43 CCH LC \xc2\xb631,155, pp. 40,985, 40,986 (D Utah 1961).  It has subsequently reaffirmed that view in briefs.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Secretary of Labor as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> Supporting Petition for Rehearing with Suggestion for Rehearing <em>En Banc</em> in <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Ackerley</em>, No. 96\xe2\x80\x9336017 etc. (CA9), pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.  And more recently it has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hotline to receive oral complaints, see Dept. of Labor, Compliance Assistance By Law\xe2\x80\x94The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm (as visited Mar. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (directing participants who wish to \xe2\x80\x9cfile a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d to contact a local office \xe2\x80\x9cor call the Department\xe2\x80\x99s Toll-Free Wage and Hour Help Line at 1\xe2\x80\x93866\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93US\xe2\x80\x93WAGE\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EEOC has set forth a similar view in its Compliance Manual, Vol. 2, \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II(B)(1), p.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x933, and n. 12 (1998), and in multiple briefs, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for EEOC as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in Support of Petition for Rehearing with Suggestion for Rehearing <em>En Banc</em> in <em>Lambert</em> v. <em>Ackerley</em>, No. 96\xe2\x80\x9336017 etc. (CA9), pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313; Brief for Appellee in <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>White &amp; Son Enterprises, Inc.</em>, No. 88\xe2\x80\x937658 (CA11), pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These agency views are reasonable.

That rule applies primarily to the interpretation of criminal statutes.  It leads us to favor a more lenient interpretation of a criminal statute \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Shabani</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/10/index.html">513 U.

And we have said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.

But after engaging in traditional methods of statutory interpretation, we cannot find that the statute remains sufficiently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of lenity here.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims that it should prevail because Kasten complained to a private employer, not to the Government; and, in Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s view, the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the Government.  Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the lower courts, which held to the contrary.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 837\xe2\x80\x93838; 619 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 613.  But Saint-Gobain said nothing about it in response to Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court until it filed its brief on the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not normally consider a separate legal question not raised in the certiorari briefs.

We see no reason to make an exception here.

I agree with at least the second part of Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s contention.  The plain meaning of the critical phrase and the context in which appears make clear that the retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance filed with a court or an agency, not oral complaints\xe2\x80\x94or even formal, written complaints\xe2\x80\x94from an employee to an employer.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In isolation, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d could cover Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s objection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting any \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xpression of grief, regret, pain \xe2\x80\xa6 or resentment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s).  But at the time the FLSA was passed (and still today) the word when used in a legal context has borne a specialized meaning: \xe2\x80\x9c[a] formal allegation or charge against a party, made or presented to the appropriate court or officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also Cambridge Dictionary of American English 172 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9ca formal statement to a government authority that you have a legal cause to complain about the way you have been treated\xe2\x80\x9d); 3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a] statement or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial authority \xe2\x80\xa6 for purposes of prosecution or of redress\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are several reasons to think that the word bears its specialized meaning here.  First, every other use of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in the FLSA refers to an official filing with a governmental body.  Sections 216(b) and (c) both state that the right to bring particular types of actions \xe2\x80\x9cshall terminate upon the filing of a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d by the Secretary of Labor, and \xc2\xa7216(c) clarifies that the statute of limitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid wages \xe2\x80\x9con the date when the complaint is filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  These provisions unquestionably use \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in the narrow legal sense.  Identical words used in different parts of a statute are presumed to have the same meaning absent contrary indication, <em>IBP, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/21/index.html">546 U. S. 21</a>, 34 (2005); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Stroop</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/478/index.html">496 U. S. 478</a>, 484 (1990).  It\nis one thing to expand the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) to include complaints filed with an agency instead of a court; it is quite something else to wrench it from the legal context entirely, to include an employee\xe2\x80\x99s objection to an employer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d appears as part of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d and thus draws meaning from the verb with which it is connected.  The choice of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a broader alternative like \xe2\x80\x9cmade,\xe2\x80\x9d if it does not connote (as the Seventh Circuit believed,\nand as I need not consider) something in writing, at least suggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action and inconsistent (at least in the less regulated work environment of 1938) with employee-to-employer complaints.  It is noteworthy that every definition of the verb \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provides, whether it supports the inclusion of oral content or not, envisions a formal, prescribed process of delivery or submission.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (comparing, for example, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 945 (to file is to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver (a paper or instrument) to the proper officer\xe2\x80\x9d) with 1 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (to file is to \xe2\x80\x9cpresent in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body\xe2\x80\x9d)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he law uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Henry</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/251/393/index.html">251 U. S. 393</a>, 395 (1920).  It is, I suppose, possible to speak of \xe2\x80\x9cfiling a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d with an employer, but that is assuredly not common usage.  Thus, when the antiretaliation provision of the Mine Health and Safety Act used that phrase in a context that includes both complaints to an agency and complaints to the employer, it did not use \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d alone, but supplemented that with \xe2\x80\x9cor made\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and to boot specified \xe2\x80\x9cincluding a complaint notifying the [mine] operator \xe2\x80\xa6 of an alleged danger or safety or health violation \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7815(c)(1).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d appears alongside three other protected activities: \xe2\x80\x9cinstitut[ing] or caus[ing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctestif[ying] in any such proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cserv[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 on an industry committee.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3).  Since each of these three activities involves\nan interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly attribute this characteristic to the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat several items in a list share an attribute counsel in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beecham </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a>, 371 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And finally, the 1938 version of the FLSA, while creating private rights of action for other employer violations, see \xc2\xa716(b), 52 Stat. 1069, did not create a private right of action for retaliation.  That was added in 1977, see \xc2\xa710, 91 Stat. 1252.  Until then, only the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor could enforce the retaliation provision.  See \xc2\xa711(a), 52 Stat. 1066.  It would seem more strange to require the employee to go to the Administrator to establish, and punish retaliation for, his intracompany complaint, than to require the Administrator-protected complaint to be filed with the Administrator in the first place.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d is clear in light of its context, and there is accordingly no need\nto rely on abstractions of congressional purpose.  Nevertheless, Kasten argues that protecting intracompany complaints best accords with the purpose of the FLSA\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto assure fair compensation to covered employees\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because such purposes are \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced when internal complaints lead to voluntary compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 18.  But no legislation pursues its ends at all costs.  <em>Rodriguez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/522/index.html">480 U. S. 522</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (1987) <em>(per curiam).</em>  Congress may not have protected intracompany complaints for the same reason it did not provide a private cause of action for retaliation against complaints: because it was unwilling to expose employers to the litigation, or to the inability to dismiss unsatisfactory workers, which that additional step would entail.  Limitation of the retaliation provision to agency complaints may have been an attempt \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve the benefits of regulation right up to the\npoint where the costs of further benefits exceed the value of those benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Easterbrook, Statutes\xe2\x80\x99 Domains, 50 U.\xc2\xa0Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 533, 541 (1983).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding whether an oral complaint may be \xe2\x80\x9cfiled,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion examines modern state and federal statutes, which presumably cover complaints filed with an employer.  The only relevance of these provisions to whether the FLSA covers such complaints is that none of them achieves that result by use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d and all of them use language that unmistakably includes complaints to employers.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (prohibiting retaliation against employees who \xe2\x80\x9coppos[e] any [unlawful] practice\xe2\x80\x9d).  Any suggestion that because more recent statutes cover intracompany complaints, a provision adopted in the 1938 Act should be deemed to do so is unacceptable.  While the jurisprudence of this Court has sometimes sanctioned a \xe2\x80\x9cliving Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d it has never approved a living United States Code.  What Congress enacted in 1938 must be applied according to its terms, and not according to what a modern Congress (or this Court) would deem desirable.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kasten argues that this Court should defer to the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (EEOC) interpretations of 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3).  He claims that those agencies have construed \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) to protect intracompany complaints \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or almost half a century,\xe2\x80\x9d in litigating positions and enforcement actions.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 22.  He also\nargues that although the Department of Labor lacks the authority to issue regulations implementing \xc2\xa7215(a)(3), it has such authority for several similarly worded provisions and has interpreted those statutes to include intracompany complaints.  <em>Id</em>., at 20.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even were \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) ambiguous, deference would still be unwarranted.  If we are to apply our new jurisprudence that deference is appropriate only when Congress has given the agency authority to make rules carrying the force of law, see <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/243/index.html">546 U. S. 243</a>, 255\xe2\x80\x93256 (2006), deference is improper here.  The EEOC has\nno such authority.  Although the Secretary of Labor and his subordinates have authority to issue regulations\nunder various provisions of the FLSA, see, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7203(<em>l</em>); \xc2\xa7206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regulations interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to issue regulations interpreting \xc2\xa7215(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Presumably for this reason, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion seems to suggest that only so-called <em>Skidmore</em> deference is appropriate, see <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U.

Citing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 15.2 and <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html">519 U.

(Curiously enough, <em>Caterpillar</em>, the case cited by the Court, was one instance.)  Rule 15.2 is permissive rather than mandatory: \xe2\x80\x9cAny objection to consideration of a question presented based on what occurred in the proceedings below \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>may</em> be deemed waived unless called to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention in the brief in opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Accordingly, the Court has often permitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised in the brief in opposition when doing so is \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented, and therefore fairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Robinette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/33/index.html">519 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3)?\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. <em>i</em>.  Surely the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d in this question must be assigned an implied addressee.  It presumably does not include a complaint to Judge Judy.  And the only plausible addressee, given the facts of this case, is the employer.  Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s rewording of the question presented in its brief in opposition is even more specific: \xe2\x80\x9cHas an employee alleging solely that he orally asserted objections <em>to his employer</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98filed any complaint\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of [\xc2\xa7215(a)(3)].\xe2\x80\x9d Brief in Opposition <em>i</em> (emphasis added).  Moreover, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(a), the question presented is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether intracompany complaints are protected is at least subsidiary to Kasten\xe2\x80\x99s formulation (and explicitly included in Saint-Gobain\xe2\x80\x99s).  The question was also decided by the courts below and was briefed before this Court.  It is not clear what benefit additional briefing would provide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, whether \xc2\xa7215(a)(3) covers intracompany complaints is \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented\xe2\x80\x9d in this case.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s own opinion demonstrates the point.  While claiming that it remains an open question whether intracompany complaints are covered, the opinion adopts a test for \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d that assumes a \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d answer\xe2\x80\x94and that makes no sense otherwise.  An employee, the Court says, is deemed to have \xe2\x80\x9cfiled [a] complaint\xe2\x80\x9d only when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee\xe2\x80\x99 to have \xe2\x80\x98put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting statutory rights under the [Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26).  This utterly atextual standard is obviously designed to counter the argument of Saint-Gobain, that if oral complaints are allowed, \xe2\x80\x9cemployers too often will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee \xe2\x80\xa6 is in fact making a complaint \xe2\x80\xa6 or just letting off steam.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  Of course, if intracompany complaints were excluded, this concern would be nonexistent: Filing a complaint with a judicial or administrative body is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of\none\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  There would be no need for lower courts to question whether a complaint is \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently clear and de-tailed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12, carries the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of formality,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, or provides \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, whatever those terms may require.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The test the Court adopts amply disproves its contention that \xe2\x80\x9cwe can decide the oral/written question separately,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.  And it makes little sense to consider that question <em>at all</em> in the present case if neither oral nor written complaints to employers are protected, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Grubbs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/90/index.html">547 U.

This Court should not issue an advisory opinion as to what would have been the scope of a retaliation provision covering complaints to employers if Congress had enacted such a provision.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Kasten and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 7, argue that the use of the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiled <em>any</em> complaint\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Con- gress meant to define the word \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint\xe2\x80\x9d expansively.  Not so.  The modifier \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d does not cause a word that is in context narrow to become broad.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto cash a check at any bank\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to a river bank, or even a blood bank.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 5 of the original FLSA, which has since been repealed, charged industry committees with recommending minimum wages for certain industries to the Department of Labor.  52 Stat. 1062.  In order to perform this function, industry committees were empowered, among other things, to \xe2\x80\x9chear \xe2\x80\xa6 witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creceive \xe2\x80\xa6 evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78(b), <em>id.,</em> at 1064.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Kasten argues that excluding intracompany complaints would make the phrases \xe2\x80\x9cfiled any complaint\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinstituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d redundant.  That is not so.  An employee may file a complaint with the Administrator that does not result in a proceeding, or has not yet done so when the employer takes its retaliatory action.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Moreover, if the substance of the retaliation provision of any other Act could shed light upon what Congress sought to achieve in the FLSA, it would be the relatively contemporaneous provision of the National Labor Relations Act, \xc2\xa78(4), 49 Stat. 453, codified at 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7158(a)(4), which did not cover retaliation for employee-employer complaints.  See <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Scrivener</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/117/index.html">405 U. S. 117</a> (1972).</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Or perhaps not.  The actual quantum of deference measured out by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is unclear\xe2\x80\x94seemingly intentionally so.  The Court says that it is giving \xe2\x80\x9ca degree of weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the Secretary and EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s views \xe2\x80\x9cgiven Congress\xe2\x80\x99 delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But it never explicitly states the level of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a> (2001), along with a parenthetical saying that \xe2\x80\x9csometimes \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial deference [is] intended even in [the] absence of rulemaking authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  I say this is mysterious because <em>Mead </em>clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for full <em>Chevron </em>deference, see <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984).  I have chosen to interpret the Court as referring to <em>Skidmore</em> deference, rather than <em>Chevron </em>deference or something in-between, in order to minimize the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law.  See <em>Mead</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 245 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both linguistically and practically.  To defer is to subordinate one\xe2\x80\x99s own judgment to another\xe2\x80\x99s.  If one has been persuaded by another, so that one\xe2\x80\x99s judgment accords with the other\xe2\x80\x99s, there is no room for deferral\xe2\x80\x94only for agreement.  Speaking of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Skidmore </em>deference\xe2\x80\x9d to a persuasive agency position does nothing but confuse.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
