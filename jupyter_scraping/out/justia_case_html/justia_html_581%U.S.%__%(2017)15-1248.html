McLane requires employees in those positions\xe2\x80\x94both new employees and those returning from medical leave\xe2\x80\x94to take a physical evaluation.  When Ochoa returned from three months of maternity leave, she failed the evaluation three times and was fired.  She then filed a sex discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC) began an investigation, but McLane declined its request for so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpedigree information\xe2\x80\x9d: names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees asked to take the evaluation.  After the EEOC expanded the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s scope both geographically (to cover McLane\xe2\x80\x99s national operations) and substantively (to investigate possible age discrimination), it issued subpoenas, as authorized by\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x939, requesting pedigree information relating to its new investigation.  When McLane refused to provide the information, the EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court\xe2\x80\x94one arising out of Ochoa\xe2\x80\x99s charge and one arising out of the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s own age-discrimination charge\xe2\x80\x94seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.  The District Judge declined to enforce the subpoenas, finding that the pedigree information was not relevant to the charges, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Reviewing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to quash the subpoena <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>, the court concluded that the lower court erred in finding the pedigree information irrelevant.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not <i>de novo.  </i>Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Both factors that this Court examines when considering whether such decision should be subject to searching or deferential appellate review point toward abuse-of-discretion review.  First, the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals is to review a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena for abuse of discretion.  Title VII confers on the EEOC the same authority to issue subpoenas that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) confers on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  During the three decades between the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and the incorporation of its subpoena-enforcement provisions into Title VII, every Circuit to consider the question had held that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on enforcement of an NLRB subpoena is subject to abuse-of-discretion review.  Congress amended Title VII to authorize EEOC subpoenas against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review, and today, nearly every Court of Appeals reviews a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena for abuse of discretion.  This \xe2\x80\x9clong history of appellate practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Pierce </i>v<i>. Underwood, </i>\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552\n, carries significant persuasive weight.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.  In most cases, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement decision will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances.  Both of these tasks are well suited to a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.  The first requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation\xe2\x80\x94an analysis \xe2\x80\x9cvariable in relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. </i>v.<i> Walling</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186\n.  And whether a subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fact-intensive, close calls\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d better suited to resolution by the district court than the court of appeals.  <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i> v. <i>Hartmarx Corp.</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384\n.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Other functional considerations also show the appropriateness of abuse-of-discretion review.  For one, the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 considerable experience in making similar decisions in other contexts, see <i>Buford</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59\n, gives them the \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional advantag[e],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at 64, that comes with greater experience.  Deferential review also \xe2\x80\x9cstreamline[s] the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i>, 496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404, something particularly important in a proceeding designed only to facilitate the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s investigation.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Court-appointed <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 arguments in support of <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review are not persuasive.  <i>Amicus</i> claims that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s primary task is to test a subpoena\xe2\x80\x99s legal sufficiency and thus requires no exercise of discretion. But that characterization is not inconsistent with abuse-of-discretion review, which may be employed to insulate the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision from appellate review for the same kind of functional concerns that underpin the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">It is also unlikely that affording deferential review to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s subpoena decision would clash with Court of Appeals decisions that instructed district courts to defer to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s determination about the relevance of evidence to the charge at issue.  Such decisions are better read as resting on the established rule that the term \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d be understood \xe2\x80\x9cgenerously\xe2\x80\x9d to permit the EEOC \xe2\x80\x9caccess to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 54\n\xe2\x80\x9369.  Nor do the constitutional underpinnings of the <i>Shell Oil</i> standard require a different result.  While this Court has described a subpoena as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constructive\xe2\x80\x99 search,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, 327 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202, and implied that the\n \nFourth Amendment is the source of the requirement that a subpoena not be \xe2\x80\x9ctoo indefinite,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton Salt Co.</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 632\n, not every decision touching on the\n \nFourth Amendment is subject to searching review.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Nixon</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683\n.  Cf. <i>Illinois</i> v. <i>Gates</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n; <i>Ornelas</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 690\n, distinguished.

The statute autho-rizes a district court to issue an order enforcing such a subpoena.  The question presented here is whether a court of appeals should review a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> or for abuse of discretion.  This decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7703(a),\n\n78Stat.\n255,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).

See <i>University of Pa.</i>, 493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 191; <i>Shell Oil</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 72, n. 26.

Ochoa worked for eight years as a \xe2\x80\x9ccigarette selector\xe2\x80\x9d for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-chain services company.  According to McLane, the job is a demanding one: Cigarette selectors work in distribution centers, where they are required to lift, pack, and move large bins containing products.  McLane requires employees taking physically demanding jobs\xe2\x80\x94both new employees and employees returning from medical leave\xe2\x80\x94to take a physical evaluation.  According to McLane, the evaluation \xe2\x80\x9ctests .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. range of motion, resistance, and speed\xe2\x80\x9dand \xe2\x80\x9cis designed, administered, and validated by a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 6.  In 2007, Ochoa took threemonths of maternity leave.  When she attempted to return to work, McLane asked her to take the evaluation.  Ochoa attempted to pass the evaluation three times, but failed.  McLane fired her.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ochoa filed a charge of discrimination, alleging (among other things) that she had been fired on the basis of her gender.  The EEOC began an investigation, and\xe2\x80\x94at its request\xe2\x80\x94McLane provided it with basic information about the evaluation, as well as a list of anonymous employees that McLane had asked to take the evaluation.  McLane\xe2\x80\x99s list included each employee\xe2\x80\x99s gender, role at the company, and evaluation score, as well as the reason each employee had been asked to take the evaluation.  But the company refused to provide what the parties call \xe2\x80\x9cpedigree information\xe2\x80\x9d: the names, Social Security numbers, last known addresses, and telephone numbers of the employees who had been asked to take the evaluation.  Upon learning that McLane used the evaluation nationwide, the EEOC expanded the scope of its investigation, both geographi-cally (to focus on McLane\xe2\x80\x99s nationwide operations) and sub-stantively (to investigate whether McLane had discriminated against its employees on the basis of age).  It issued subpoenas requesting pedigree information as it related to its new investigation.  But McLane refused to providethe pedigree information, and so the EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court\xe2\x80\x94one arising out of Ochoa\xe2\x80\x99s charge and one arising out of a separate age-discrimination charge the EEOC itself had filed\xe2\x80\x94seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The enforcement actions were assigned to the same District Judge, who, after a hearing, declined to enforce the subpoenas to the extent that they sought the pedigree information.

Both factors point toward abuse-of-discretion review here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals in reviewing a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena is to review that decision for abuse of discretion.  That practice predates even Title VII itself.  As noted, Title VII confers on the EEOC the same authority to issue subpoenas that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) confers on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  See n.\xc2\xa01, <i>supra</i>.  During the three decades between the enactment of the NLRA and the incorporation of the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s subpoena-enforcement provisions into Title VII, every Circuit to consider the question had held that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to enforce an NLRB subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Consolidated Vacuum Corp.</i>, 395 F.\xc2\xa02d 416, 419\xe2\x80\x93420 (CA2 1968); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Friedman</i>, 352 F.\xc2\xa02d 545, 547 (CA3 1965); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Northern Trust Co.</i>, 148 F.\xc2\xa02d 24, 29 (CA7 1945); <i>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i> v. <i>NLRB</i>, 122 F.\xc2\xa02d 450, 453\xe2\x80\x93454 (CA6 1941).  By the time Congress amended Title VII to authorize EEOC subpoenas in 1972, it did so against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, nearly as uniformly, the Courts of Appeals apply the same deferential review to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena.  Almost every Court of Appeals reviews such a decision for abuse of discretion.  See, <i>e.g., EEOC</i> v. <i>Kronos Inc.</i>, 620 F.\xc2\xa03d 287, 295\xe2\x80\x93296 (CA3 2010); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Randstad</i>, 685 F.\xc2\xa03d 433, 442 (CA4 2012); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Roadway Express, Inc.</i>, 261 F.\xc2\xa03d 634, 638 (CA6 2001); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>United Air Lines, Inc.</i>, 287 F. 3d 643, 649 (CA7 2002); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Technocrest Systems, Inc.</i>, 448 F.\xc2\xa03d 1035, 1038 (CA8 2006); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Dillon Companies, Inc.</i>, 310 F.\xc2\xa03d 1271, 1274 (CA10 2002); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.</i>, 771 F.\xc2\xa03d 757, 760 (CA11 2014) (<i>per curiam</i>).  As Judge Watford\xe2\x80\x94writing for the panel below\xe2\x80\x94recognized, the Ninth Circuit alone applies a more searching form of review.  See 804 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1056, n.\xc2\xa03 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhy we review questions of relevance and undue burden de\xc2\xa0novo is unclear\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>EPA</i> v. <i>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co.</i>, 836 F.\xc2\xa02d 443, 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (CA9 1988) (holding that <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review applies).  To be sure, the inquiry into the appropriate standard of review cannot be resolved by a head-counting exercise.  But the \xe2\x80\x9clong his-tory of appellate practice\xe2\x80\x9d here, <i>Pierce</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 558, carries significant persuasive weight.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.  The decision whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena is a case-specific one that turns not on \xe2\x80\x9ca neat set of legal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Illinois</i> v. <i>Gates</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213,\n232 (1983)\n, but instead on the application of broad standards to \xe2\x80\x9cmultifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Pierce</i>, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561\xe2\x80\x93562 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the mine run of cases, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to enforce a subpoena will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge before it or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances.  Both tasks are well suited to a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.  The decision whether evidence sought is relevant requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation\xe2\x80\x94an analysis \xe2\x80\x9cvariable in relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. </i>v.<i> Walling</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186,\n209 (1946)\n.  Similarly, the decision whether a subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them.  These inquiries are \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally not amenable to broad <i>per\xc2\xa0se</i> rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sprint/United Management Co.</i> v. <i>Mendelsohn</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379,\n387 (2008)\n; rather, they are the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cfact-intensive, close calls\xe2\x80\x9d better suited to resolution by the district court than the court of appeals,<i> Cooter &amp; Gell</i> v. <i>Hartmarx Corp.</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 384,\n404 (1990)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other functional considerations also show that abuse-of-discretion review is appropriate here.  For one, district courts have considerable experience in other contexts making decisions similar\xe2\x80\x94though not identical\xe2\x80\x94to those they must make in this one.  See <i>Buford</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 59,\n66 (2001)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he comparatively greater expertise\xe2\x80\x9d of the district court may counsel in favor of deferential review).  District courts decide, for instance, whether evidence is relevant at trial, Fed. Rule Evid. 401; whether pretrial criminal subpoenas are unreasonable in scope, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(c)(2); and more.  These decisions are not the same as the decisions a district court must make in enforcing an administrative subpoena.  But they are similar enough to give the district court the \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional advantag[e],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Buford</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 64, that comes with greater experience.  For another, as we noted in <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i>, deferential review \xe2\x80\x9cstreamline[s] the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d 496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404\xe2\x80\x94a particularly important consideration in a \xe2\x80\x9csatellite\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding like this one, <i>ibid.</i>, designed only to facilitate the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s investigation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 arguments to the contrary have aided our consideration of this case.  But they do not persuade us that <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review is appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 central argument is that the decision whether a subpoena should be enforced does not require the exercise of discretion on the part of the district court, and so it should not be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  On <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 view, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s primary role is to test the legal sufficiency of the subpoena, not to weigh whether it should be enforced as a substantive matter.  Cf. <i>Shell Oil</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 72, n. 26 (rejecting the argument that the district court should assess the validity of the underlying claim in a proceeding to enforce a subpoena).  Even accepting <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 view of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s task, however, this understanding of abuse-of-discretion review is too narrow.  As commentators have observed, abuse-of-discretion review is employed not only where a decisionmaker has \xe2\x80\x9ca wide range of choice as to what he decides, free from the constraints which characteristically attach whenever legal rules enter the decision[making] process\xe2\x80\x9d; it is also employed where the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision is given \xe2\x80\x9can unu-sual amount of insulation from appellate revision\xe2\x80\x9d for func-tional reasons.  Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed From Above, 22 Syracuse L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 635, 637 (1971); see also 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa75166.1 (2d ed. 2012).  And as we have explained, it is in large part due to functional concerns that we conclude the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Even if the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision can be characterized in the way that <i>amicus</i> suggests, that characterization would not be inconsistent with abuse-of-discretion review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor are we persuaded by <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 remaining arguments.  <i>Amicus</i> argues that affording deferential review to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision would clash with Court of Appeals decisions instructing district courts to defer themselves to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s determination that evidence is relevant to the charge at issue.  See <i>Director, Office of Thrift Supervision,</i> v. <i>Vinson &amp; Elkins, LLP</i>, 124 F.\xc2\xa03d 1304, 1307 (CADC 1997) (district courts should defer to agency appraisals of relevance unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cobviously wrong\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Lockheed Martin Corp.</i>, <i>Aero &amp; Naval Systems</i>, 116 F.\xc2\xa03d 110, 113 (CA4 1997) (same).  In <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 view, it is \xe2\x80\x9canalytically impossible\xe2\x80\x9d for the court of appeals to defer to the district court if the district court must itself defer to the agency.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  We think the better reading of those cases is that they rest on the established rule that the term \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d be understood \xe2\x80\x9cgenerously\xe2\x80\x9d to permit the EEOC \xe2\x80\x9caccess to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shell Oil</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 68\xe2\x80\x9369.  A district court deciding whether evidence is \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d under Title VII need not defer to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s decision on that score; it must simply answer the question cognizant of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s broad authority to seek and obtain evidence.  Because the statute does not set up any scheme of double deference, <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 arguments as to the infirmities of such a scheme are misplaced.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do we agree that, as <i>amicus</i> suggests, the constitutional underpinnings of the <i>Shell Oil</i> standard require a different result.  To be sure, we have described a subpoena as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constructive\xe2\x80\x99 search,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Oklahoma Press</i>, 327 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202, and implied that the\n \nFourth Amendment is the source of the requirement that a subpoena not be \xe2\x80\x9ctoo indefinite,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Morton Salt</i>, 338 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 652.  But not every decision that touches on the\n \nFourth Amendment is subject to searching review.  Subpoenas in a wide variety of other contexts also implicate the privacy interests protected by the\n \nFourth Amendment, but courts routinely review the enforcement of such subpoenas for abuse of discretion.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Nixon</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683,\n702 (1974)\n (pretrial subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i>); <i>In\xc2\xa0re Grand Jury Subpoena</i>, 696 F.\xc2\xa03d 428, 432 (CA5 2012) (grand jury subpoenas); <i>In\xc2\xa0re Grand Jury Proceedings</i>, 616 F.\xc2\xa03d 1186, 1201 (CA10 2010) (same).  And this Court has emphasized that courts should pay \xe2\x80\x9cgreat deference\xe2\x80\x9d to a magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination of probable cause, <i>Gates</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 236 (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94a decision more akin to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s preenforcement review of a subpoena than the warrantless searches and seizures we considered in <i>Ornelas</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 690 (1996)\n, on which <i>amicus</i> places great weight.  The constitutional pedigree of <i>Shell Oil</i> does not change our view of the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enforce an EEOC subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The United States also argues that the judgment below can be affirmed because it is clear that the District Court abused its discretion.  But \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a court of review, not of first view,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (2005), and the Court of Appeals has not had the chance to review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision under the appropriate standard.  That task is for the Court of Appeals in the first instance.  As part of its analysis, the Court of Appeals may also consider, as and to the extent it deems appropriate, any arguments made by McLane regarding the burdens imposed by the subpoena.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The statute does so by conferring on the EEOC the same authority given to the National Labor Relations Board to conduct investigations.

As the Court of Appeals explained, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to enforce the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (EEOC) subpoena for pedigree information rested on a legal error.  Lower court resolution of a question of law is ordinarily reviewable <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> on appeal.  <i>Highmark Inc.</i> v. <i>Allcare Health Management System, Inc.</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and n.\xc2\xa02 (2014) (slip op., at 4, and n.\xc2\xa02).
