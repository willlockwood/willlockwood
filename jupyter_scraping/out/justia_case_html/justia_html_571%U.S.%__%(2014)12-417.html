U.\xc2\xa0S. Steel contends that this donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collective-bargaining agreement with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 union.  That provision\xe2\x80\x99s validity depends on\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(o), which allows parties to collectively bargain over whether \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0at the beginning or end of each workday\xe2\x80\x9d must be compensated.  The District Court granted U.\xc2\xa0S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, holding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 donning and doffing constituted \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7203(o).  It also assumed that any time spent donning and doffing items that were not \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cde minimis\xe2\x80\x9d and hence noncompensable.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective gear is not compensable by operation of \xc2\xa7203(o).  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (a)\xc2\xa0This Court initially construed compensability under the Fair Labor Standards Act expansively.  See, e.g., Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,\n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680\n.  The Act was amended in 1949, however, to provide that the compensability of time spent \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday\xe2\x80\x9d is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining, \xc2\xa7203(o).  Whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 donning and doffing qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d depends on the meaning of that statutory phrase.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cclothes,\xe2\x80\x9d which is otherwise undefined, is \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreted as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perrin v. United States,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37\n.  In dictionaries from the era of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s text or context suggests anything other than this ordinary meaning.  There is no basis for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proposition that the unmodified term \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d somehow omits protective clothing.  Section 203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s exception applies only when the changing of clothes is \xe2\x80\x9can integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed,\xe2\x80\x9d Steiner v. Mitchell,\n\n350 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247\n, and thus otherwise compensable under the Act.  See\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7254(a).  And protective gear is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such as butchers and longshoremen.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position is also incompatible with the historical context of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s passage, contradicting contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in Steiner, see 350 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, 254\xe2\x80\x93255.  The interpretation adopted here leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices.  The view of respondent and its amici that \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual foundation.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0While the normal meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d connotes substitution, \xe2\x80\x9cchanging\xe2\x80\x9d also carried the meaning to \xe2\x80\x9calter\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  The broader statutory context makes plain that \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes\xe2\x80\x9d includes time spent in altering dress.  Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely personal choice, and \xc2\xa7203(o) should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another reading is textually permissible.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (d)\xc2\xa0Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning and doffing in this case qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7203(o).  Of the 12 items at issue, only 3\xe2\x80\x94safety glasses, earplugs, and a respirator\xe2\x80\x94do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of Appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law does not take account of trifles).  But that doctrine does not fit comfortably within this statute, which is all about trifles.  A more appropriate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes or washing.\xe2\x80\x9d  If an employee devotes the vast majority of that time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the entire period would not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7203(o), even if some clothes items were also donned and doffed.  But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and doffing \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.  Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs was minimal.  And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Circuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during the normal workday and thus fell beyond \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.

Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner Clifton Sandifer, among others, filed suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act against respondent United States Steel Corporation in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  The plaintiffs in this putative collective action are a group of current or former employees of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s steelmaking facilities.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  As relevant here, they seek backpay for time spent donning and doffing various pieces of protective gear.  Petitioners assert that respondent requires workers to wear all of the items because of hazards regularly encountered in steel plants.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners point specifically to 12 of what they state are the most common kinds of required protective gear: a flame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a \xe2\x80\x9csnood\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cwristlets\xe2\x80\x9d; work gloves; leggings; \xe2\x80\x9cmetatarsal\xe2\x80\x9d boots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  At bottom, petitioners want to be paid for the time they have spent putting on and taking off those objects.  In the aggregate, the amount of time\xe2\x80\x94and thus money\xe2\x80\x94involved is likely to be quite large.  Because this donning-and-doffing time would otherwise be compensable under the Act, U.\xc2\xa0S. Steel\xe2\x80\x99s contention of noncompensability stands or falls upon the validity of a provision of its collective-bargaining agreement with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 union, which says that this time is noncompensable.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  The validity of that provision depends, in turn, upon the applicability of\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7203(o) to the time at issue.  That subsection allows parties to decide, as part of a collective-bargaining agreement, that \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at the beginning or end of each workday\xe2\x80\x9d is noncompensable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court granted summary judgment in pertinent part to U.\xc2\xa0S. Steel, holding that donning and doffing the protective gear constituted \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7203(o).  No. 2:07\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93443 RM, 2009 WL 3430222, *4\xe2\x80\x93*10 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009).  The District Court further assumed that even if certain items\xe2\x80\x94the hardhat, glasses, and earplugs\xe2\x80\x94were not \xe2\x80\x9cclothes,\xe2\x80\x9d the time spent donning and doffing them was \xe2\x80\x9cde minimis\xe2\x80\x9d and hence noncompensable.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld those conclusions.  678 F.\xc2\xa03d 590, 593\xe2\x80\x93595 (2012).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), and now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II.

See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21\n\xe2\x80\x9326 (2005).  This Court gave those terms a broad reading, culminating in its holding in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,\n\n328 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680 (1946)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory workweek includes all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s premises, on duty or at a prescribed workplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 690\xe2\x80\x93691.

United States,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37,\n42 (1979)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Dictionaries from the era of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary of the English Language 507 (2d ed. 1950) (Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[c]overing for the human body; dress; vestments; vesture\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, e.g., 2 Oxford English Dictionary 524 (1933) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[c]overing for the person; wearing apparel; dress, raiment, vesture\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is what we hold to be the meaning of the word as used in \xc2\xa7203(o).  Although a statute may make \xe2\x80\x9ca departure from the natural and popular acceptation of language,\xe2\x80\x9d Greenleaf v. Goodrich,\n\n101 U.\xc2\xa0S. 278\n\xe2\x80\x93285 (1880) (citing Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251 (1854)), nothing in the text or context of \xc2\xa7203(o) suggests anything other than the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners argue that the word \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d is too indeterminate to be ascribed any general meaning but that, whatever it includes, it necessarily excludes items designed and used to protect against workplace hazards.  That position creates a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cprotection,\xe2\x80\x9d on the one hand, and \xe2\x80\x9cdecency or comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d on the other\xe2\x80\x94a distinction that petitioners appear to have derived from Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second, which elaborates that \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca general term for whatever covering is worn, or is made to be worn, for decency or comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 507 (emphasis added).  But that definition does not exclude, either explicitly or implicitly, items with a protective function, since \xe2\x80\x9cprotection\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomfort\xe2\x80\x9d are not incompatible, and are often synonymous.  A parasol protects against the sun, enhancing the comfort of the bearer\xe2\x80\x94just as work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts, enhancing the comfort of the wearer.  Petitioners further assert that protective items of apparel are referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cclothing\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d  They point out that, when introduced by the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cprotective,\xe2\x80\x9d the noun \xe2\x80\x9cclothing\xe2\x80\x9d is used more commonly than \xe2\x80\x9cclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is true enough, but it seems to us explained by euphonic preference rather than difference in meaning.  We see no basis for the proposition that the unmodified term \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d somehow omits protective clothing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proffered distinction, moreover, runs the risk of reducing \xc2\xa7203(o) to near nothingness.  The statutory compensation requirement to which \xc2\xa7203(o) provides an exception embraces the changing of clothes only when that conduct constitutes \xe2\x80\x9can integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Steiner, 350 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 256.  But protective gear is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of factory workers, butchers, longshoremen, and a host of other occupations.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d would largely limit the application of \xc2\xa7203(o) to what might be called workers\xe2\x80\x99 costumes, worn by such employees as waiters, doormen, and train conductors.  Petitioners insist that their definition excludes only items with some specific work-hazard-related protective function, but that limitation essentially abandons the assertion that clothes are for decency or comfort, leaving no basis whatever for the distinction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position is also incompatible with the historical context surrounding \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s passage, since it flatly contradicts an illustration provided by the Labor Department\xe2\x80\x99s 1947 regulations to show how \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d could be intimately related to a principal activity.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.7, and n. 49.  Those regulations cited the situation in which \xe2\x80\x9can employee in a chemical plant\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0cannot perform his [job] without putting on certain clothes\xe2\x80\x9d and specified that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch a situation may exist where the changing of clothes on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s premises is required by law, by rules of the employer, or by the nature of the work.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 Fed. Reg. 7660, and n.\xc2\xa065; 29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.8(c), and n.\xc2\xa065.  And petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position contradicts this Court\xe2\x80\x99s only prior opinion purporting to interpret \xc2\xa7203(o).  Steiner, announced less than a decade after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s passage, suggested in dictum that, were there a pertinent provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, \xc2\xa7203(o) would have applied to the facts of that case\xe2\x80\x94where workers \xe2\x80\x9cma[d]e extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic materials, and [we]re compelled by circumstances, including vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change clothes\xe2\x80\x9d on the job site.  350 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248, 254\xe2\x80\x93255.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners contend that any attempt at a general definition of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d will cast a net so vast as to capture all manner of marginal things\xe2\x80\x94from bandoliers to barrettes to bandages.  Yet even acknowledging that it may be impossible to eliminate all vagueness when interpreting a word as wide-ranging as \xe2\x80\x9cclothes,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 fanciful hypotheticals give us little pause.  The statutory context makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d referred to are items that are integral to job performance; the donning and doffing of other items would create no claim to compensation under the Act, and hence no need for the \xc2\xa7203(o) exception.  Moreover, even with respect to items that can be regarded as integral to job performance, our definition does not embrace the view, adopted by some Courts of Appeals, that \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d means essentially anything worn on the body\xe2\x80\x94including accessories, tools, and so forth.  See, e.g., Salazar v. Butterball, LLC, 644 F.\xc2\xa03d 1130, 1139\xe2\x80\x931140 (CA10 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9citems or garments worn by a person\xe2\x80\x9d and include \xe2\x80\x9cknife holders\xe2\x80\x9d).  The construction we adopt today is considerably more contained.  Many accessories\xe2\x80\x94necklaces and knapsacks, for instance\xe2\x80\x94are not \xe2\x80\x9cboth designed and used to cover the body.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor are tools \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly regarded as articles of dress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our definition leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent and its amici, by contrast, give the term in question a capacious construction, effectively echoing the Courts of Appeals mentioned above.  On this view, \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work.  That interpretation is, to be sure, more readily administrable, but it is even more devoid of a textual foundation than petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offering.  Congress could have declared bargainable under \xc2\xa7203(o) \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing outfits,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in putting on and off all the items needed for work.\xe2\x80\x9d  For better or worse, it used the narrower word \xe2\x80\x9cclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThe role of this Court is to apply the statute as it is written\xe2\x80\x94even if we think some other approach might accord with good policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Burrage v. United States, ante at 14 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B. \xe2\x80\x9cChanging\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Having settled upon the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes,\xe2\x80\x9d we must now consider the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners assert that when used with certain objects\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9ctire,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdiaper,\xe2\x80\x9d or, indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the term \xe2\x80\x9cchanging\xe2\x80\x9d connotes substitution.  That is undoubtedly true.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Second 448 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cto make substitutionof, for, or among, often among things of the same kind.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0; as, to change one\xe2\x80\x99s clothes\xe2\x80\x9d).  One would not normally say he has changed clothes when he puts on an overcoat.  Petitioners conclude from this that items of protective gear that are put on over the employee\xe2\x80\x99s street clothes are not covered by \xc2\xa7203(o).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We disagree.  Although it is true that the normal meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d connotes substitution, the phrase is certainly able to have a different import.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cchanging\xe2\x80\x9d carried two common meanings at the time of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment: to \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9calter.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, e.g., 2 Oxford English Dictionary 268 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cchange,\xe2\x80\x9d among other verb forms, as \xe2\x80\x9cto substitute another (or others) for, replace by another (or others)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make (a thing) other than it was; to render different, alter, modify, transmute\xe2\x80\x9d).  We think that despite the usual meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d the broader statutory context makes it plain that \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes\xe2\x80\x9d includes time spent in altering dress.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The object of \xc2\xa7203(o) is to permit collective bargaining over the compensability of clothes-changing time and to promote the predictability achieved through mutually beneficial negotiation.  There can be little predictability, and hence little meaningful negotiation, if \xe2\x80\x9cchanging\xe2\x80\x9d means only \xe2\x80\x9csubstituting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether one actually exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply layers garments atop one another after arriving on the job site is often a matter of purely personal choice.  That choice may be influenced by such happenstances and vagaries as what month it is, what styles are in vogue, what time the employee wakes up, what mode of transportation he uses, and so on.  As the Fourth Circuit has put it, if the statute imposed a substitution requirement \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for putting on a company-issued shirt might turn on something as trivial as whether the employee did or did not take off the t-shirt he wore into work that day.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sepulveda v. Allen Family Foods, Inc., 591 F.\xc2\xa03d 209, 216 (2009).  Where another reading is textually permissible, \xc2\xa7203(o) should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C. Application</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, we hold that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 donning and doffing of the protective gear at issue qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7203(o).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioners have pointed to 12 particular items: a flame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a snood; wristlets; work gloves; leggings; metatarsal boots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator.  The first nine clearly fit within the interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cclothes\xe2\x80\x9d elaborated above: they are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.  That proposition is obvious with respect to the jacket, pants, hood, and gloves.  The hardhat is simply a type of hat.  The snood is basically a hood that also covers the neck and upper shoulder area; on the ski slopes, one might call it a \xe2\x80\x9cbalaclava.\xe2\x80\x9d  The wristlets are essentially detached shirtsleeves.  The leggings look much like traditional legwarmers, but with straps.  And the metatarsal boots\xe2\x80\x94more commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9csteel-toed\xe2\x80\x9d boots\xe2\x80\x94are just a special kind of shoe.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The remaining three items, by contrast, do not satisfy our standard.  Whereas glasses and earplugs may have a covering function, we do not believe that they are commonly regarded as articles of dress.  And a respirator obviously falls short on both grounds.  The question is whether the time devoted to the putting on and off of these items must be deducted from the noncompensable time.  If so, federal judges must be assigned the task of separating the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the period in question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals in this case, have sought to avoid, or at least mitigate, this difficulty by invoking the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law does not take account of trifles).  This, they hold, enables them to declare noncompensable a few minutes actually spent on something other than clothes-changing\xe2\x80\x94to wit, donning and doffing non-clothes items.\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the roots of the de minimis doctrine stretch to ancient soil, its application in the present context began with Anderson.  There, the Court declared that because \xe2\x80\x9c[s]plit-second absurdities are not justified by the actualities of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\xe2\x80\x9d such \xe2\x80\x9ctrifles\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours\xe2\x80\x9d may be \xe2\x80\x9cdisregarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  328 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 692.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe [thus] do not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. preclude the application of a de minimis rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We doubt that the de minimis doctrine can properly be applied to the present case.  To be sure, Anderson included \xe2\x80\x9cputting on aprons and overalls\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cremoving shirts\xe2\x80\x9d as activities to which \xe2\x80\x9cit is appropriate to apply a de minimis doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 692\xe2\x80\x93693.  It said that, however, in the context of determining what preliminary activities had to be counted as part of the gross workweek under \xc2\xa7207(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  A de minimis doctrine does not fit comfortably within the statute at issue here, which, it can fairly be said, is all about trifles\xe2\x80\x94the relatively insignificant periods of time in which employees wash up and put on various items of clothing needed for their jobs.  Or to put it in the context of the present case, there is no more reason to disregard the minute or so necessary to put on glasses, earplugs, and respirators, than there is to regard the minute or so necessary to put on a snood.  If the statute in question requires courts to select among trifles, de minimis non curat lex is not Latin for close enough for government work.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That said, we nonetheless agree with the basic perception of the Courts of Appeals that it is most unlikelyCongress meant \xc2\xa7203(o) to convert federal judges into time-study professionals.  That is especially so since the conse-quence of dispensing with the intricate exercise of separating the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities is not to prevent compensation for the uncovered segments, but merely to leave the issue of compensation to the process of collective bargaining.  We think it is possible to give the text of \xc2\xa7203(o) a meaning that avoids such relatively inconsequential judicial involvement in \xe2\x80\x9ca morass of difficult, fact-specific determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d Sepulveda, 591 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 218.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The forerunner of \xc2\xa7203(o)\xe2\x80\x94the Portal-to-Portal Act provision whose interpretation by the Labor Department prompted its enactment\xe2\x80\x94focused narrowly on the activities involved: \xe2\x80\x9cactivities which are preliminary to orpostliminary to [the employee\xe2\x80\x99s] principal activity or activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7254(a)(2).  Section 203(o), by contrast, is addressed not to certain \xe2\x80\x9cactivities,\xe2\x80\x9d but to \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent\xe2\x80\x9d on certain activities, viz., \xe2\x80\x9cchanging clothes or washing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just as one can speak of \xe2\x80\x9cspending the day skiing\xe2\x80\x9d even when less-than-negligible portions of the day are spent having lunch or drinking hot toddies, so also one can speak of \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent changing clothes and washing\xe2\x80\x9d when the vast preponderance of the period in question is devoted to those activities.  To be sure, such an imprecise and colloquial usage will not ordinarily be attributed to a statutory text, but for the reasons we have discussed we think that appropriate here.  The question for courts is whether the period at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes or washing.\xe2\x80\x9d  If an employee devotes the vast majority of the time in question to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items (perhaps a diver\xe2\x80\x99s suit and tank) the entire period would not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ctime spent in changing clothes\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7203(o), even if some clothes items were donned and doffed as well.
