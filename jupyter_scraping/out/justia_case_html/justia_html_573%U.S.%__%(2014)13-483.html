Lane eventually terminated Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 employment.  Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz.  Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.  Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant budget shortfalls.  Respondent Franks, then CACC\xe2\x80\x99s president, terminated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties.  A few days later, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations\xe2\x80\x94those of Lane and one other employee.  Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that Franks had violated the\n \nFirst Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court granted Franks\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment, holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the\n \nEleventh Amendment.

That obligation is distinct and independent from any separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his employer.  The Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly in holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply because he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course of his employment.  Garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of that employment.  The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.  Indeed, speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.

See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.

Rather, the\n \nFirst Amendment protection of a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech depends on a careful balance \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563,\n568 (1968)\n.  In Pickering, the Court struck the balance in favor of the public employee, extending\n \nFirst Amendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school board that employed him.  Today, we consider whether the\n \nFirst Amendment similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony, compelled by sub-poena, outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2006, Central Alabama Community College (CACC) hired petitioner Edward Lane to be the Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a statewide program for underprivileged youth.  CACC hired Lane on a probationary basis.  In his capacity as Director, Lane was responsible for overseeing CITY\xe2\x80\x99s day-to-day operations, hiring and firing employees, and making decisions with respect to the program\xe2\x80\x99s finances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At the time of Lane\xe2\x80\x99s appointment, CITY faced significant financial difficulties.  That prompted Lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program\xe2\x80\x99s expenses.  The audit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State Representative on CITY\xe2\x80\x99s payroll, had not been reporting to her CITY office.  After unfruitful discussions with Schmitz, Lane shared his finding with CACC\xe2\x80\x99s president and its attorney.  They warned him that firing Schmitz could have negative repercussions for him and CACC.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and in-structed her to show up to the Huntsville office to serveas a counselor.  Schmitz refused; she responded that shewished to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98continue to serve the CITY program in the same manner as [she had] in the past.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lane v. Central Ala. Community College, 523 Fed. Appx. 709, 710 (CA11 2013) (per curiam).  Lane fired her shortly thereafter.  Schmitz told another CITY employee, Charles Foley, that she intended to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98get [Lane] back\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for firing her.  2012 WL 5289412, *1 (ND Ala., Oct. 18, 2012).  She also said that if Lane ever requested money from the state legislature for the program, she would tell him, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[y]ou\xe2\x80\x99re fired.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 termination drew the attention of many, including agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which initiated an investigation into Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 employment with CITY.  In November 2006, Lane testified before a federal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz.  In January 2008, the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.  See United States v. Schmitz, 634 F.\xc2\xa03d 1247, 1256\xe2\x80\x931257 (CA11 2011).  The indictment alleged that Schmitz had collected $177,251.82 in federal funds even though she performed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtually no services,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generated virtually no work product,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rarely even appeared for work at the CITY Program offices.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1260.  It further alleged that Schmitz had submitted false statements concerning the hours she worked and the nature of the services she performed.  Id., at 1257.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 trial, which garnered extensive press coverage,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] commenced in August 2008.  Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz.  The jury failed to reach a verdict.  Roughly six months later, federal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and Lane testified once again.  This time, the jury convicted Schmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four countsof theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.  The District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison and ordered her to pay $177,251.82 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Meanwhile, CITY continued to experience considerable budget shortfalls.  In November 2008, Lane began reporting to respondent Steve Franks, who had become president of CACC in January 2008.  Lane recommended that Franks consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties.  In January 2009, Franks decided to terminate 29 probationary CITY employees, including Lane.  Shortly thereafter, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations\xe2\x80\x94those of Lane and one other employee\xe2\x80\x94 because of an \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity in [those other employees\xe2\x80\x99] probationary service.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Franks 11.  Franks claims that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not rescind Lane\xe2\x80\x99s termination\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0because he believed that Lane was in a fundamentally different category than the other employees: he was the director of the entire CITY program, and not simply an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  In September 2009, CACC eliminated the CITY program and terminated the program\xe2\x80\x99s remaining employees.  Franks later retired, and respondent Susan Burrow, the current Acting President of CACC, replaced him while this case was pending before the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In January 2011, Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that Franks had violated the\n \nFirst Amendment by firing him in retaliation for his testimony against Schmitz.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Lane sought damages from Franks in his individual capacity and sought equitable relief, including reinstatement, from Franks in his official capacity.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court granted Franks\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment.  Although the court concluded that the record raised \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine issues of material fact .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. concerning [Franks\xe2\x80\x99] true motivation for terminating [Lane\xe2\x80\x99s] employment,\xe2\x80\x9d 2012 WL 5289412, *6, it held that Franks was entitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims because \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable government official in [Franks\xe2\x80\x99] position would not have had reason to believe that the Constitution protected [Lane\xe2\x80\x99s] testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d id., *12.  The District Court relied on Garcetti v. Ceballos,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410 (2006)\n, which held that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for\n \nFirst Amendment pur-poses.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 5289412, *10 (quoting Garcetti, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S.,at 421).  The court found no violation of clearly established law because Lane had \xe2\x80\x9clearned of the information that he testified about while working as Director at [CITY],\xe2\x80\x9d such that his \xe2\x80\x9cspeech [could] still be considered as part of his official job duties and not made as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 5289412, *10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  523 Fed. Appx., at 710.  Like the District Court, it relied extensively on Garcetti.  It reasoned that, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if an employee was not required to make the speech as part of his official duties, he enjoys no\n \nFirst Amendment protection if his speech \xe2\x80\x98owes its existence to [the] employee\xe2\x80\x99s professional responsibilities\xe2\x80\x99 and is \xe2\x80\x98a product that the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer himself has commissioned or created.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 711 (quoting Abdur-Rahman v. Walker, 567 F.\xc2\xa03d 1278, 1283 (CA11 2009)).  The court concluded that Lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he was acting pursuant to his official duties when he investigated Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 employment, spoke with Schmitz and CACC officials regarding the issue, and terminated Schmitz.  523 Fed. Appx., at 712.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat Lane testified about his official activities pursuant to a sub-poena and in the litigation context,\xe2\x80\x9d the court continued,\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not bring Lane\xe2\x80\x99s speech within the protection of the\n \nFirst Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Eleventh Circuit also concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a constitutional violation of Lane\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFirst Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances, Franks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his personal capacity\xe2\x80\x9d because the right at issue had not been clearly established.  Id., at 711, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. __ (2014), to resolve discord among the Courts of Appeals as to whether public employees may be fired\xe2\x80\x94or suffer other adverse employment consequences\xe2\x80\x94for providing truthful subpoenaed testimony outside the course of their ordinary job responsibilities.  Compare 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (case below), with, e.g., Reilly v. Atlantic City, 532 F.\xc2\xa03d 216, 231 (CA3 2008).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at the heart of the\n \nFirst Amendment, which \xe2\x80\x9cwas fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,\xe2\x80\x9d Roth v. United States,\n\n354 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476,\n484 (1957)\n.  This remains true when speech concerns information related to or learned through public employment.  After all, public employees do not renounce their citizenship when they accept employment, and this Court has cautioned time and again that public employers may not condition employment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights.  See, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,\n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589,\n605 (1967)\n; Pickering, 391 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568; Connick v.

For \xe2\x80\x9c[g]overnment employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work.\xe2\x80\x9d  Waters v. Churchill,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 661,\n674 (1994)\n (plurality opinion).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe interest at stake is as much the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s own right to disseminate it.\xe2\x80\x9d  San Diego v. Roe,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77,\n82 (2004)\n (per curiam).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our precedents have also acknowledged the government\xe2\x80\x99s countervailing interest in controlling the operation of its workplaces.  See, e.g., Pickering, 391 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568.  \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment employers, like private employers, need a significant degree of control over their employees\xe2\x80\x99 words and actions; without it, there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garcetti, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 418.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether the employee\xe2\x80\x99s interest or the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest should prevail in cases where the government seeks to curtail the speech of its employees.  It requires \xe2\x80\x9cbalanc[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the interests of the [public employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  391 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568.  In Pickering, the Court held that a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s letter to the editor of a local news-paper concerning a school budget constituted speech on amatter of public concern.  Id., at 571.  And in balancing the employee\xe2\x80\x99s interest in such speech against the government\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency interest, the Court held that the publication of the letter did not \xe2\x80\x9cimped[e] the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinterfer[e] with the regular operation of the schools generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  The Court therefore held that the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s speech could not serve as the basis for his dismissal.  Id., at 574.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Garcetti, we described a two-step inquiry into whether a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech is entitled to protection:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  If the answer is no, the employee has no\n \nFirst Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the speech.  If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a\n \nFirst Amendment claim arises.  The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 418 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In describing the first step in this inquiry, Garcetti distinguished between employee speech and citizen speech.  Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger protection, the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for\n \nFirst Amendment pur-poses, and the Constitution does not insulate their communi-cations from employer discipline.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 421.  Applying that rule to the facts before it, the Court found that an internal memorandum prepared by a prosecutor in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted unprotected employee speech.  Id., at 424.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Against this backdrop, we turn to the question pre-sented: whether the\n \nFirst Amendment protects a public employee who provides truthful sworn testimony, compelledby subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The first inquiry is whether the speech in question\xe2\x80\x94Lane\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 trials\xe2\x80\x94is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  It clearly is.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Truthful testimony under oath by a public employee outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a citizen for\n \nFirst Amendment purposes.  That is so even when the testimony relates to his public employment or concerns information learned during that employment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In rejecting Lane\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his testimony was speech as a citizen, the Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift to the nature of sworn judicial statements and ignored the obligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath.  See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712 (finding immaterial the fact that Lane spoke \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to a subpoena and in the litigation context\xe2\x80\x9d).  Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a simple reason: Anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth.  See, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71623 (criminalizing false statements under oath in judicial proceedings); United States v. Mandujano,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564,\n576 (1976)\n (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cPerjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concept of judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d).  When the person testifying is a public employee, he may bear separate obligations to his employer\xe2\x80\x94for example, an obligation not to show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner.  But any such obligations as an employee are distinct and independent from the obligation, as a citizen, to speak the truth.  That independent obligation renders sworn testimony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech made purely in the capacity of an employee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen whenhe testified, the Eleventh Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly.  It reasoned that, because Lane learned of the sub-ject matter of his testimony in the course of his employment with CITY, Garcetti requires that his testimony be treated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a citizen.  See 523 Fed. Appx., at 712.  It does not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The sworn testimony in this case is far removed from the speech at issue in Garcetti\xe2\x80\x94an internal memorandum prepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors recommending dismissal of a particular prosecution.  The Garcetti Court held that such speech was made pursuant to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cofficial responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen [the employee] went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform, [he] acted as a government employee.  The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean that his supervisors were prohib-ited from evaluating his performance.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 422, 424.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But Garcetti said nothing about speech that simply relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of public employment.  The Garcetti Court made explicit that its holding did not turn on the fact that the memo at issue \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned the subject matter of [the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s] employment,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFirst Amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s job.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 421.  In other words, the mere fact that a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee\xe2\x80\x94rather than citizen\xe2\x80\x94speech.  The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to Pickering have recognized that speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holdsspecial value precisely because those employees gainknowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.  In Pickering, for example, the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]eachers are .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the members of a commu-nity most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent.  Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.\xe2\x80\x9d  391 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572; see also Garcetti, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 421 (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he same is true of many other categories of public employees\xe2\x80\x9d).  Most recently, in San Diego v. Roe, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 80, the Court again observed that public employees \xe2\x80\x9care uniquely qualified to comment\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cmatters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The importance of public employee speech is especially evident in the context of this case: a public corruption scandal.  The United States, for example, represents that because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for federal corruption offenses that are brought in a typical year .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. often depend on evidence about activities that government officials undertook while in office,\xe2\x80\x9d those prosecutions often \xe2\x80\x9crequire testimony from other government employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.  It would be antithetical to our jurisprudence to conclude that the very kind of speech necessary to prosecute corruption by public officials\xe2\x80\x94speech by public employees regarding information learned through their employment\xe2\x80\x94may never form the basis for a\n \nFirst Amendment retaliation claim.  Such a rule would place public employees who witness corruption in an impossible position, torn between the obligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid retaliation and keep their jobs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Applying these principles, it is clear that Lane\xe2\x80\x99s sworn testimony is speech as a citizen.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lane\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is also speech on a matter of public concern.  Speech involves matters of public concern \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it can \xe2\x80\x98be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,\xe2\x80\x99 or when it \xe2\x80\x98is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937) (citation omitted).  The inquiry turns on the \xe2\x80\x9ccontent, form, and context\xe2\x80\x9d of the speech.  Connick, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 147\xe2\x80\x93148.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The content of Lane\xe2\x80\x99s testimony\xe2\x80\x94corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds\xe2\x80\x94obviously involves a matter of significant public concern.  See, e.g., Garcetti, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 425 (\xe2\x80\x9cExposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the form and context of the speech\xe2\x80\x94sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding\xe2\x80\x94fortify that conclusion.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnlike speech in other contexts, testimony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her statements will be the basis for official governmental action, action that often affects the rights and liberties of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We hold, then, that Lane\xe2\x80\x99s truthful sworn testimony at Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 criminal trials is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This does not settle the matter, however.  A public employee\xe2\x80\x99s sworn testimony is not categorically entitled to\n \nFirst Amendment protection simply because it is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  Under Pickering, if an employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public concern, the next question is whether the government had \xe2\x80\x9can adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the public\xe2\x80\x9d based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s needs as an employer.  Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 418.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As discussed previously, we have recognized that government employers often have legitimate \xe2\x80\x9cinterest[s] in the effective and efficient fulfillment of [their] responsibilities to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98maintain[ing] proper discipline in public service.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Connick, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 150\xe2\x80\x93151.  We have also cautioned, however, that \xe2\x80\x9ca stronger showing [of government interests] may be necessary if the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech more substantially involve[s] matters of public concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 152.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Here, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s side of the Pickering scale is entirely empty: Respondents do not assert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their favor.  There is no evidence, for example, that Lane\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at Schmitz\xe2\x80\x99 trials was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed any sensitive, confidential, or privileged information while testifying.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  In these circumstances, we conclude that Lane\xe2\x80\x99s speech is entitled to protection under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  The Eleventh Circuit erred in holding otherwise and dismissing Lane\xe2\x80\x99s claim of retaliation on that basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is protected under the\n \nFirst Amendment, the claims against him in his individual capacity should be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity.  We agree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Qualified immunity \xe2\x80\x9cgives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  Under this doctrine, courts may not award damages against a government official in his personal capacity unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe right was \xe2\x80\x98clearly established\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of the challenged conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The relevant question for qualified immunity purposes is this: Could Franks reasonably have believed, at the time he fired Lane, that a government employer could fire an employee on account of testimony the employee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities?  Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks from reasonably holding that belief.  And no decision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In dismissing Lane\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the Eleventh Circuit relied on its 1998 decision in Morris v. Crow, 142 F.\xc2\xa03d 1379 (per curiam).  There, a deputy sheriff sued the sheriff and two other officials, alleging that he had been fired in retaliation for statements he made in an accident report and later giving deposition testimony about his investigation of a fatal car crash between another officer and a citizen.  Id., at 1381.  In his accident report, the plaintiff noted that the officer was driving more than 130 mph in a 50 mph zone, without using his emergency blue warning light.  See ibid.  The plaintiff later testified to these facts at a deposition in a wrongful death suit against the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office.  Ibid.  His superiors later fired him.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Eleventh Circuit, in a pre-Garcetti decision, concluded that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s deposition testimony was unprotected.  It held that a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech is protected only when it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98made primarily in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s role as citizen,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98primarily in the role of employee.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Morris, 142 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1382.  And it found the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s deposition testimony to be speech as an em-ployee because it \xe2\x80\x9creiterated the conclusions regardinghis observations of the accident\xe2\x80\x9d that he \xe2\x80\x9cgenerated in thenormal course of [his] duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Critically, the court acknowledged\xe2\x80\x94and was unmoved by\xe2\x80\x94the fact that al-though the plaintiff had investigated the accident andprepared the report pursuant to his official duties, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cevidence that [he] gave deposition testimony for any reason other than in compliance with a subpoena to testify truthfully in the civil suit regarding the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The court further reasoned that the speech could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe characterized as an attempt to make public comment on sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office policies and procedures, the internal workings of the department, the quality of its employees or upon any issue at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lane argues that two other Eleventh Circuit precedents put Franks on notice that his conduct violated the\n \nFirst Amendment: Martinez v. Opa-Locka, 971 F.\xc2\xa02d 708 (1992) (per curiam), and Tindal v. Montgomery Cty. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n, 32 F.\xc2\xa03d 1535 (1994).  Martinez involved a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s subpoenaed testimony before the Opa-Locka City Commission regarding her employer\xe2\x80\x99s procurement practices.  971 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 710.  The Eleventh Circuit held that her speech was protected, reasoning that it addressed a matter of public concern and that her interest in speaking freely was not outweighed by her employer\xe2\x80\x99s interest in providing government services.  Id., at 712.  It held, further, that the relevant constitutional rules were so clearly established at the time that qualified immunity did not apply.  Id., at 713.  Tindal, decided two years after Martinez, involved a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s subpoenaed testimony in her co-worker\xe2\x80\x99s sexual harassment lawsuit.  32 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1537\xe2\x80\x931538.  The court again ruled in favor of the em-ployee.  It held that the employee\xe2\x80\x99s speech touched upona public concern and that her employer had not offered any evidence that the speech hindered operations.  Id., at 1539\xe2\x80\x931540.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Morris, Martinez, and Tindal represent the landscape of Eleventh Circuit precedent the parties rely on for qualified immunity purposes.  If Martinez and Tindal were controlling in the Eleventh Circuit in 2009, we would agree with Lane that Franks could not reasonably have believed that it was lawful to fire Lane in retaliation for his testimony.  But both cases must be read together with Morris, which reasoned\xe2\x80\x94in declining to afford\n \nFirst Amendment protection\xe2\x80\x94that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s decision to testify was motivated solely by his desire to comply with a subpoena.  The same could be said of Lane\xe2\x80\x99s decision to testify.  Franks was thus entitled to rely on Morris when he fired Lane.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lane argues that Morris is inapplicable because it distinguished Martinez, suggesting that Martinez survived Morris.  See Morris, 142 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1382\xe2\x80\x931383.  But this debate over whether Martinez or Morris applies to Lane\xe2\x80\x99s claim only highlights the dispositive point: At the time of Lane\xe2\x80\x99s termination, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not provide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning information acquired through public employment is speech of a citizen entitled to\n \nFirst Amendment protection.  At best, Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is insufficient to defeat the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, Lane argues that decisions of the Third and Seventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of Lane was unconstitutional.  See Reilly, 532 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 231 (CA3) (truthful testimony in court is citizen speech protected by the\n \nFirst Amendment); Morales v. Jones, 494 F.\xc2\xa03d 590, 598 (CA7 2007) (similar).

Our decision does not resolve, however, the claims against Burrow\xe2\x80\x94initially brought against Franks when he served as President of CACC\xe2\x80\x94in her official capacity.  Although the District Court dismissed those claims for prospective relief as barred by the\n \nEleventh Amendment, the Eleventh Circuit declined to consider that question on appeal, see 523 Fed.

Ceballos,\n\n547 U. S. 410,\n418 (2006)\n, when the employee gives \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ruthful testimony under oath . . . outside the scope of his ordinary job duties,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 9.  Answering that question requires little more than a straightforward application of Garcetti.  There, we held that when a public employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d his official duties, he is not speaking \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d and\n \nFirst Amendment protection is unavailable.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 421\xe2\x80\x93422.  The petitioner in this case did not speak \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d his ordinary job duties because his responsibilities did not include testifying in court proceedings, see ante, at 8, n. 4, and no party has suggested that he was subpoenaed as a representative of his employer, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6) (requiring subpoenaed organizations to designate witnesses to testify on their behalf).  Because petitioner did not testify to \xe2\x80\x9cfulfil[l] a [work] responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Garcetti, supra, at 421, he spoke \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d not as an employee.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We accordingly have no occasion to address the quite different question whether a public employee speaks \xe2\x80\x9cas a citizen\xe2\x80\x9d when he testifies in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.  See ante, at 8, n.\xc2\xa04.  For some public employees\xe2\x80\x94such as police officers, crime scene technicians, and laboratory analysts\xe2\x80\x94testifying is a routine and critical part of their employment duties.  Others may be called to testify in the context of particular litigation as the designated representatives of their employers.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6).  The Court properly leaves the constitutional questions raised by these scenarios for another day.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
