States Marine Lines,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html">398 U. S. 375</a></span> (1970), overruling <em>The Harrisburg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/case.html">119 U. S. 199</a></span> (1886), held that an action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness is maintainable under federal maritime law, but left the shaping of the new nonstatutory action to future cases.  The question in this case is whether the widow of a longshoreman may maintain such an action for the wrongful death of her husband -- alleged to have resulted from injuries suffered by him while aboard a vessel in navigable waters -- after the decedent recovered damages in his lifetime for his injuries.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s husband suffered severe injuries while working as a longshoreman aboard petitioner\'s vessel, the S.S. <em>Claiborne,</em> in Louisiana navigable waters.  He recovered $140,000 for his permanent disability, physical agony, and loss of earnings in an action based on unseaworthiness, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] but died shortly after the action was terminated.  Respondent brought this wrongful death action in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana for damages suffered by her.  Based on her husband\'s recovery, the District Court dismissed the widow\'s suit on grounds of <em>res judicata</em> and failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that <em>Moragne</em> gave</p>\n<p>"Mrs. Gaudet . . . a compensable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 414 U.

We granted certiorari, 411 U.S. 963 (1973), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The harshness of the <em>Harrisburg</em> rule that, in the absence of a statute, there is no maritime action for wrongful death, was only partially relieved by enactment of federal and state wrongful death statutes. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Death </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 414 U. S. 576</a></p><p> on the High Seas Act, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 761-768, created a wrongful death action for death outside the three-mile limit. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688, incorporating the Federal Employers\' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 51-60, established such an action based on negligence for the wrongful death of a seaman regardless of the situs of the wrong; but otherwise, wrongful death actions for deaths occurring on navigable waters within the three-mile territorial waters of a State depended upon whether the State had enacted a wrongful death statute and, if so, whether the statute permitted recovery. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Moragne</em> reflected dissatisfaction with this state of the law that illogically and unjustifiably deprived the dependents of many maritime death victims of an adequate remedy for their losses.  Three clearly unjust consequences were of particular concern:</p>\n<p>"The first of these is simply the discrepancy produced whenever the rule of <em>The Harrisburg</em> holds sway:  within territorial waters, identical conduct violating federal law (here the furnishing of an unseaworthy vessel) produces liability if the victim is merely injured, but frequently not if he is killed. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The second incongruity is that identical breaches of the duty to provide a seaworthy ship, resulting in death, produce liability outside the three-mile </p><p><a class="page-number" name="577">Page 414 U. S. 577</a></p><p> limit -- since a claim under the Death on the High Seas Act may be founded on unseaworthiness, <em>see Kernan v.

S. 430</a></span> n. 4 (1958) -- but not within the territorial waters of a State whose local statute excludes unseaworthiness claims. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The third, and assertedly the \'strangest,\' anomaly is that a true seaman -- that is, a member of a ship\'s company, covered by the Jones Act -- is provided no remedy for death caused by unseaworthiness within territorial waters, while a longshoreman, to whom the duty of seaworthiness was extended only because he performs work traditionally done by seamen, does have such a remedy when allowed by a state statute (footnote omitted)."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#395">398 U. S. 395</a></span>-396.</p>\n<p>In overruling <em>The Harrisburg, Moragne</em> ended these anomalies by the creation of a uniform federal cause of action for maritime death, designed to extend to the dependents of maritime wrongful death victims admiralty\'s "special solicitude for the welfare of those men who under[take] to venture upon hazardous and unpredictable sea voyages."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#387">398 U. S. 387</a></span>.  Our approach to the resolution of the issue before us must necessarily be consistent with the extension of this "special solicitude" to the dependents of the seafaring decedent.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, Sea-Land Services, Inc. (Sea-Land), would attach no significance to this extension in shaping the maritime wrongful death remedy.  It argues that the wrongful death remedy should recognize no loss independent of the decedent\'s claim for his personal injuries, and therefore that respondent had a wrongful death remedy only "in the event Gaudet failed to prosecute [his own claim] during his lifetime."  Brief for Petitioner 6.  But <em>Moragne</em> had already implicitly rejected that argument, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 414 U. S. 578</a></p><p> for we there recognized that a single tortious act might result in two distinct, though related, harms, giving rise to two separate causes of action:</p>\n<p>"in the case of mere injury, the person physically harmed is made whole for his harm, while, in the case of death, those closest to him -- usually spouse and children -- seek to recover for their total loss of one on whom they depended."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#382">398 U. S. 382</a></span>.  Thus, <em>Moragne</em> created a true wrongful death remedy -- founded upon the death itself and independent of any action the decedent may have had for his own personal injuries. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Because the respondent\'s suit involves a different cause of action, it is not precluded by <em>res judicata.</em>  For <em>res judicata</em> operates only to bar</p>\n<p>"repetitious suits involving the same cause of action.  [The bar] rests upon considerations of economy of judicial time and public policy favoring the establishment of certainty in legal relations.  The rule provides that, when a court of competent jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 414 U. S. 579</a></p><p> has entered a final judgment on the merits of a cause of action, the parties to the suit and their privies are thereafter bound"</p>\n<p>"not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose."</p>\n<p>"<em>Cromwell v. County of Sac,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/94/351/case.html">94 U. S. 351</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/94/351/case.html#352">94 U. S. 352</a></span>.  The judgment puts an end to the cause of action, which cannot again be brought into litigation between the parties upon any ground whatever, absent fraud or some other factor invalidating the judgment.  <em>See</em> Von Moschzisker, \'Res Judicata,\' 38 Yale L.J. 299; Restatement of the Law of Judgments, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 47, 48."</p>\n<p><em>Commissioner v. Sunnen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/591/case.html">333 U.

S. 597</a></span> (1948).</p>\n<p>To be sure, a majority of courts interpreting state and federal wrongful death statutes have held that an action for wrongful death is barred by the decedent\'s recovery for injuries during his lifetime.  But the bar does not appear to rest in those cases so much upon principles of <em>res judicata</em> or public policy as upon statutory limitations on the wrongful death action.  As one authority has noted,</p>\n<p>"[t]he fact that all civil remedies for wrongful death derive from statute has important consequences.  Since the right was unknown to common law, the legislatures which created the right were free to impose restrictions upon it."</p>\n<p>2 Harper &amp; James \xc2\xa7 24.1, p. 1285.  Thus, England\'s Lord Campbell\'s Act, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] the first wrongful death statute, permits recovery</p>\n<p>"whensoever the Death of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="580">Page 414 U. S. 580</a></p><p> Person shall be caused by [the] wrongful Act . . . [of another] and the Act . . . is such as would (if Death had not ensued) have entitled the Party injured to maintain an Action and recover Damages in respect thereof. . . ."</p>\n<p>Early English cases interpreting the Act held that this language conditioned wrongful death recovery upon the existence of an actionable cause of the decedent at his death; [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] if the deceased had reduced his claim to judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 414 U. S. 581</a></p><p> and settled with or released his tortfeasor, and therefore, up to the time he died, could not have maintained a further action for his injuries, his dependents could have no cause of action for his wrongful death.  Since Lord Campbell\'s Act became the prototype of American wrongful death statutes, most state statutes contained nearly identical language, and have been similarly interpreted by state courts. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Though the federal wrongful death statutes do </p><p><a class="page-number" name="582">Page 414 U. S. 582</a></p><p> not contain the sane controversial language, the FELA, at least, has been held to be "essentially identical with" Lord Campbell\'s Act, <em>Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/227/59/case.html">227 U. S. 59</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/227/59/case.html#69">227 U. S. 69</a></span> (1913), and therefore similar restrictions have been placed on FELA wrongful death recovery.  <em>Mellon v. Goodyear,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html">277 U.

S. 583</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Moragne</em>, on the other hand, requires that the shape of the new maritime wrongful death remedy (not a statutory creation but judge-made, <em>see The Tungus v. Skovgaard,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/588/case.html">358 U. S. 588</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/588/case.html#611">358 U. S. 611</a></span> (1959) (opinion of BRENNAN, J.)) be guided by the principle of maritime law that</p>\n<p>"certainly it better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not required to withhold it by established and inflexible rules,"</p>\n<p><em>The Sea Gull,</em> 21 F.Cas. 909 (No. 12,578) (C.C. Md. 1865), quoted in <em>Moragne</em>, 398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#387">398 U. S. 387</a></span>.  Since the policy underlying the remedy is to insure compensation of the dependents for their losses resulting from the decedent\'s death, the remedy should not be precluded merely because the decedent, during his lifetime, is able to obtain a judgment for his own personal injuries.  No statutory language or "established and inflexible rules" of maritime law require a contrary conclusion. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Sea-Land argues that, if dependents are not prevented from bringing a separate cause of action for wrongful death in cases where the decedent has already received a judgment for his personal injuries, then necessarily it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="584">Page 414 U. S. 584</a></p><p> will be subject to double liability.  In order to evaluate this argument, it is necessary first to identify the particular harms suffered by the dependents for which the maritime wrongful death remedy permits recovery of damages.  In identifying these compensable harms, we are not without useful guides, for, in <em>Moragne,</em> we recognized that, with respect to</p>\n<p>"particular questions of the measure of damages, the courts will not be without persuasive analogy for guidance.  Both the Death on the High Seas Act and the numerous state wrongful death acts have been implemented with success for decades.  The experience thus built up counsels that a suit for wrongful death raises no problems unlike those that have long been grist for the judicial mill."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#408">398 U. S. 408</a></span>.  Our review of those authorities and the policies of maritime law persuade us that, under the maritime wrongful death remedy, the decedent\'s dependents may recover damages for their loss of support, services, and society, as well as funeral expenses.</p>\n<p>Recovery for loss of support has been universally recognized, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and includes all the financial contributions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="585">Page 414 U. S. 585</a></p><p> that the decedent would have made to his dependents had he lived.  Similarly, the overwhelming majority of state wrongful death acts [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and courts interpreting the Death on the High Seas Act [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] have permitted recovery for the monetary value of services the decedent provided and would have continued to provide but for his wrongful death. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Such services include, for example, the nurture, training, education, and guidance that a child would have received had not the parent been wrongfully killed. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Services the decedent performed at home or for his spouse are also compensable. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Compensation for loss of society, however, presents a closer question.  The term "society" embraces a broad range of mutual benefits each family member receives from the others\' continued existence, including love, affection, care, attention, companionship, comfort, and protection. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Unquestionably, the deprivation of these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="586">Page 414 U. S. 586</a></p><p> benefits by wrongful death is a grave loss to the decedent\'s dependents.  Despite this fact, a number of early wrongful death statutes were interpreted by courts to preclude recovery for these losses on the ground that the statutes were intended to provide compensation only for "pecuniary loss," and that the loss of society is not such an economic loss. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Other wrongful death statutes contain express language limiting recovery to pecuniary losses; [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] for example, the Death on the High </p><p><a class="page-number" name="587">Page 414 U. S. 587</a></p><p> Seas Act limits recovery to "a fair and just compensation for the <em>pecuniary</em> loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought . . . ," 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 762 (emphasis added), and consequently has been construed to exclude recovery for the loss of society. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>A clear majority of States, on the other hand, have rejected such a narrow view of damages, and, either by express statutory provision or by judicial construction, permit recovery for loss of society. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  This expansion of damages recoverable under wrongful death statutes to include loss of society has led one commentator to observe that</p>\n<p>"[w]hether such damages are classified as \'pecuniary\' or recognized and allowed as nonpecuniary, the recent trend is unmistakably in favor of permitting such recovery."</p>\n<p>Speiser 218.  Thus, our decision to permit recovery for loss of society aligns the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="588">Page 414 U. S. 588</a></p><p> maritime wrongful death remedy with a majority of state wrongful death statutes. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  But in any event, our decision is compelled if we are to shape the remedy to comport with the humanitarian policy of the maritime law to show "special solicitude" for those who are injured within its jurisdiction. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Objection to permitting recovery for loss of society often centers upon the fear that such damages are somewhat speculative, and that factfinders will return </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 414 U. S. 589</a></p><p> excessive verdicts. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  We were not unaware of this objection in <em>Moragne</em>, where we said:</p>\n<p>"[O]ther courts have recognized that calculation of the loss sustained by dependents or by the estate of the deceased, which is required under most present wrongful death statutes . . . , does not present difficulties more insurmountable than assessment of damages for many nonfatal personal injuries."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#385">398 U. S. 385</a></span>.</p>\n<p>For example, juries are often called upon to measure damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish in disfigurement cases, or intentional infliction of emotional harm.  In fact, since the 17th century, juries have assessed damages for loss of consortium -- which encompasses loss of society -- in civil actions brought by husbands whose wives have been negligently injured.

A majority of States provided for such recovery under their wrongful death statutes. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Furthermore, although there is a conflict over whether funeral expenses are compensable under the Death on the High Seas Act, <em>compare The Culberson,</em> 61 F.2d 194 (CA3 1932), <em>with Moore v. The O S Fram,</em> 226 F.Supp. 816 (SD Tex.1963), <em>aff\'d sub nom. Wilhelm Seafoods, Inc. v. Moore,</em> 328 F.2d 868 (CA5 1964), it is clear that funeral expenses were permitted under the general maritime law prior to <em>The Harrisburg, \\see, e.g., Hollyday v. The David Reeves,</em> 12 F.Cas. 386 (No. 6,625) (Md. 1879).  We therefore find no persuasive reason for not following the earlier admiralty rule, and thus hold that funeral expenses are compensable. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Turning now to Sea-Land\'s double liability argument, we note that, in contrast to the elements of damages which we today hold may be recovered in a maritime wrongful death action, the decedent recovered damages only for his loss of past and future wages, pain and suffering, and medical and incidental expenses.  Obviously, the decedent\'s recovery did not include damages for the dependents\' loss of services or of society, and funeral expenses.  Indeed, these losses -- unique to the decedent\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="592">Page 414 U. S. 592</a></p><p> dependents -- could not accrue until the decedent\'s death.  Thus, recovery of damages for these losses in the maritime wrongful death action will not subject Sea-Land to double liability or provide the dependents with a windfall.</p>\n<p>There is, however, an apparent overlap between the decedent\'s recovery for loss of future wages and the dependents\' subsequent claim for support. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  In most instances, the dependents\' support will derive, at least in part, from the decedent\'s wages.  But, when a tortfeasor has already fully compensated the decedent, during his lifetime, for his loss of future wages, the tortfeasor should not be required to make further compensation in a subsequent wrongful death suit for any portion of previously paid wages.  Any potential for such double liability can be eliminated by the application of familiar principles of collateral estoppel to preclude a decedent\'s dependents from attempting to relitigate the issue of the support due from the decedent\'s future wages.

The pertinent exception here is that nonparties may be collaterally estopped from relitigating issues necessarily decided in a suit brought by a party who acts as a fiduciary representative for the beneficial interest of the nonparties. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  In such cases,</p>\n<p>"the beneficiaries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="594">Page 414 U.

[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Thus, when a decedent brings his own personal injury action during his lifetime and recovers damages for his lost wages, he acts in a fiduciary capacity to the extent that he represents his dependents\' interest in that portion of his prospective earnings which, but for his wrongful death, they had a reasonable expectation of his providing for their support.  Since the decedent\'s recovery of any future wages will normally be dependent upon his fully litigating that issue, we need not fear that applying principles of collateral estoppel to preclude </p><p><a class="page-number" name="595">Page 414 U.

The latter have been separately enacted to abrogate the common law rule that an action for tort abated at the death of either the injured person or the tortfeasor.  Survival statutes permit the deceased\'s estate to prosecute any claims for personal injury the deceased would have had but for his death.  They do not permit recovery for harms suffered by the deceased\'s family as a result of his death.  <em>See Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/227/59/case.html">227 U.

The underlying reasons for survival statutes have been summarized by Professor Harper:</p>\n<p>"At early common law, the personal representative could not be sued for a tort committed by the decedent during his lifetime.  From early notions of the untransmittability of blame -- and the <em>quasi</em>-criminal nature of early tort law must not be forgotten -- to the crystalization of the maxim <em>action personalis moritur cum persona,</em> the common law was developed without exception, and the rule was uniform that tort actions died with the parties, either wrongdoer or injured party.  There was, then, no survival of a right of action either in favor of or against an executor or administrator until statutes modified somewhat the rule of dependability upon the lives of the original parties to the wrong."</p>\n<p>F. Harper, Law of Torts 673-674 (1933), quoted in 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 24.1 n. 2 (1956) (hereafter Harper &amp; James).  Survival statutes, in one form or another, have been enacted in over one-half the States, and supplement the state wrongful death statutes, <em>see</em> W. Prosser, The Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 126, p. 900 (4th ed.1971) (hereafter Prosser), though, in a small number of States, the survival statute provides the only death remedy available, <em>see</em> 2 Harper &amp; James \xc2\xa7 24.2, p. 1288.  The Federal Employers\' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 59, and the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688, but not the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 761-768, contain survival provisions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Kernan v.

Before that statute, the person who received a personal injury, and survived its consequences, could bring an action, and recover damages for the injury; but if he died from its effects, then no action could be brought.  To meet this state of the law, the 9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 93, was passed, and"</p>\n<p>"whenever the death of a person is caused by a wrongful act, and the act is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action, and recover damages in respect thereof, then . . . the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable for an action for damages notwithstanding the death of the party injured."</p>\n<p>"Here, taking the plea to be true, the party injured could not \'maintain an action in respect thereof,\' because he had already received satisfaction."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., . . . Legg v. Britton,</em> 6 Vt. 652, 24 A. 1016 (1892); <em>Melitch v. United R. &amp; E. Co.,</em> 121 Md. 457, 88 A. 229 (1913).  This interpretation has been by no means universal.  A number of courts interpreting Lord Campbell\'s Act-type state wrongful death statutes have held that a wrongful death action could be prosecuted even though before his death the decedent could not have brought a cause of action for his personal injuries, because he had already recovered a judgment, settled, or released his claims.  A classic statement of this view is that of the South Dakota Supreme Court in <em>Rowe v. Richards,</em> 35 S.D. 201, 215-216, 151 N.W. 1001, 1006 (1915):</p>\n<p>"We must confess our inability to grasp the logic of any course of so-called reasoning through which the conclusion is drawn that the husband, simply because he may live to suffer from a physical injury, and thus become vested with a cause of action for the violation of his own personal right, has an implied power to release a cause of action -- one which has not then accrued; one which may never accrue; and one which, from its very nature, cannot accrue until his death; and one which, if it ever does accrue, will accrue in favor of his wife and be based solely upon a violation of a right vested solely in the wife."</p>\n<p>The contrary interpretation of the pertinent statutory language has also been the subject of scholarly criticism.  Professor Prosser argues:</p>\n<p>"It is not at all clear, however, that such provisions of the death acts ever were intended to prevent recovery where the deceased once had a cause of action, but it has terminated before his death.  The more reasonable interpretation would seem to be that they are directed at the necessity of some original tort on the part of the defendant, under circumstances giving rise to liability in the first instance, rather than to subsequent changes in the situation affecting only the interest of the decedent."</p>\n<p>Prosser \xc2\xa7 127, p. 911.  <em>See also</em> Schumacher 120-121; Fleming, The Lost Years:  A Problem in the Computation and Distribution of Damages, 50 Calif.L.Rev. 598, 608-610 (1962); Anno., 70 Am.St.Rep. 666, 684 (1898).  In States where the limiting language of Lord Campbell\'s Act is absent from the wrongful death statute, the courts have permitted wrongful death actions although the decedent had already recovered for his own injuries, <em>see, e.g., Blackwell v. American Film Co.,</em> 189 Cal.689, 693-694, 209 P. 999, 1001 (1922).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Beyond the common elements that the FELA may share with Lord Campbell\'s Act, express statutory terms peculiar to the FELA lend additional support for the result reached in <em>Mellon v.

This language was understood by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Oliver,</em> 261 F. 1, 2 (1919):</p>\n<p>"The two distinct rights of action are given in the alternative or disjunctively.  The language used indicates the absence of an intention to allow recoveries for the same wrong by both the injured employee and, in case of his death, by his personal representative; only one recovery being allowed when the injured employee dies without having enforced the right of action given to him.  It seems to be a fair inference from that language that the right of action given to the injured employee\'s personal representative was intended to be unenforceable after the enforcement and satisfaction of the one given to the employee himself."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Significantly, the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 761-768, the only federal statute "that deals specifically and exclusively with actions for wrongful death . . . for breaches of the duties imposed by general maritime law," <em>Moragne v.

The former entails the loss of positive benefits, while the latter represents an emotional response to the wrongful death.  The difference between the two is well expressed as follows:</p>\n<p>"When we speak of recovery for the beneficiaries\' mental anguish, we are primarily concerned not with the benefits they have lost, but with the issue of compensating them for their harrowing experience resulting from the death of a loved one.  This requires a somewhat negative approach.  The fundamental question in this area of damages is what deleterious effect has the death, as such, had upon the claimants?

Those sources indicate that 27 of the 44 state and territorial wrongful death statutes which measure damages by the loss sustained by the beneficiaries permit recovery for loss of society.  Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have statutes expressly providing for such damages.  Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Washington have equivocal statutory language that has been judicially interpreted to include recovery for loss of society.  Finally, the wrongful death statutes of California, Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Pennsylvania, Texas, and the Virginia Islands, which either expressly or by judicial construction limit recovery to pecuniary losses, have been judicially interpreted, nevertheless, to permit recovery for the pecuniary value of the decedent\'s society.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>We recognize, of course, that our decision permits recovery of damages not generally available under the Death on the High Seas Act.  Traditionally, however, "Congress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law," <em>Fitzerald v.

The scope and content of the general maritime remedy for wrongful death established in <em>Moragne</em> is no exception.  After combing the legislative history of the Death on the High Seas Act, we concluded in <em>Moragne</em> that Congress expressed</p>\n<p>"no intention . . . of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#400">398 U. S. 400</a></span>.  Nothing in the legislative history of the Act suggests that Congress intended the Act\'s statutory measure of damages to preempt any additional elements of damage for a maritime wrongful death remedy which this Court might deem "appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law."  To the contrary, Congress\' insistence that the Act not extend to territorial waters, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 216, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1919); H.R.Rep. No. 674, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1920); 59 Cong.Rec. 4482-4486 (1920), indicates that Congress was not concerned that there be a uniform measure of damages for wrongful deaths occurring within admiralty\'s jurisdiction, for, in many instances, state wrongful death statutes extending to territorial waters provided a more liberal measure of damages than the Death on the High Seas Act.  <em>See Greene v. Vantage S.S. Corp.,</em> 466 F.2d 159 (CA4 1972).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Insofar as <em>Simpson v.

JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court today rewrites several areas of the admiralty law of wrongful death.  In holding that a wrongful death action may be brought although the decedent has previously recovered in his own suit based on the same wrongful act, the Court disregards a major body of maritime and state law.  The majority opinion also opens up an area of sentimental damages that has not been allowed under traditional admiralty doctrine.  It hopes to prevent double recovery through a novel application of collateral estoppel principles, which rests in turn on the unprecedented concept that a seriously injured person acts as a fiduciary for an undefined class of potential beneficiaries with regard to his own recovery in his own personal injury action.  Given the sweep of the majority\'s approach, the upshot in many areas will be a nearly total nullification of the congressional enactments previously governing maritime wrongful death.  Except for a technical joinder of counts to obtain a jury trial, and thus to maximize the benefits promised by the Court\'s opinion, no one entitled to rely on the admiralty doctrine of unseaworthiness will, after today, seek relief under the federal maritime wrongful death statutes.  Several limitations built into those congressional enactments have been swept aside by the majority\'s decision.</p>\n<p>In reaching these results, the majority purports to apply <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html">Moragne v. States Marine Lines,</a></span></em> 398 U.S. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="596">Page 414 U. S. 596</a></p><p> 375 (1970).  It is true that <em>Moragne</em> overruled <em>The Harrisburg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/case.html">119 U. S. 199</a></span> (1886), and held that an action for death caused by a violation of maritime duties would lie under the general law of admiralty.  But <em>Moragne</em> does not support the Court\'s far-reaching holdings in this case.  Indeed, <em>Moragne</em>, which was essentially a response to a gap in maritime remedies for deaths occurring in state territorial waters, explicitly counsels against the sort of <em>tabula rasa</em> restructuring of the law of admiralty undertaken by the majority.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Harlan stressed the need to "assure uniform vindication of federal policies. . . ."  398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#401">398 U.

In my view, these unprecedented extensions of admiralty law exhibit little deference for <em>stare decisis</em> or, indeed, for enunciated congressional policy.  I also believe these new doctrines are unsound as a matter of principle, will create difficulty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="597">Page 414 U. S. 597</a></p><p> and confusion in the litigation of admiralty cases, and are very likely to result in duplicative recoveries.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Long accepted law under the Jones Act, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] one of the two federal maritime wrongful death statutes, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] does not countenance the result reached by the majority today.  The Jones Act "created a federal right of action for the wrongful death of a seaman based on the statutory action under the Federal Employers\' Liability Act [FELA]."  <em>Kernan v. American Dredging Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/426/case.html">355 U.

Since the FELA, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 51-60, is the "regime which the Jones Act made applicable to seamen . . . ," [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] the "entire judicially developed doctrine of liability" under the FELA governs a Jones Act case.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="598">Page 414 U.

An uninterrupted line of FELA and Jones Act cases going back a half century holds that, if the decedent reduces his claim to settlement or judgment prior to his death, or otherwise extinguishes his right to pursue the claim, no subsequent wrongful death action may be brought.  <em>See, e.g., Mellon v. Goodyear,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html">277 U. S. 335</a></span> (1928); <em>Flynn v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.

Luckenbach S.S. Co.,</em> 93 F.Supp. 271 (SDNY 1949).</p>\n<p><em>Mellon</em> and its progeny hold unequivocally that a judgment, settlement, or similarly conclusive event with regard to the decedent\'s own right to seek recovery for his personal injuries "[precludes] any remedy by the personal representative based upon the same wrongful act."  <em>Mellon, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html#344">277 U. S. 344</a></span>.  The Court in <em>Mellon</em> quoted with approval the following language from a state court opinion:</p>\n<p>""<em>Whether the right of action is a transmitted right or an original right, whether it be created by a survival statute or by a statute creating an independent right, the general consensus of opinion seems to be that the gist and foundation of the right in all cases is the wrongful act, and that, for such wrongful act, but one recovery should be had, and that, if the deceased had received satisfaction in his lifetime, either by settlement and adjustment or by adjudication in the courts, no further right of action existed.\'"" </em></p>\n<p>277 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html#345">277 U. S. 345</a></span>.  (Citation omitted.)  The <em>Mellon</em> rule does not rest on a disagreement in principle with the majority\'s view, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#577">414 U. S. 577</a></span>-578, that a single wrong is capable of producing separate and distinct injuries, those to the decedent and those to his beneficiaries.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="599">Page 414 U. S. 599</a></p><p> Indeed, the Court in <em>Mellon</em> explicitly recognized that distinction.  It noted that, although originating in the same wrongful act, there are two separate and distinct claims, one assertable by the injured person and the other upon his death by his personal representative or dependents.  277 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html#340">277 U. S. 340</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/335/case.html#342">277 U. S. 342</a></span>.  Nevertheless, <em>Mellon</em> and uniformly consistent Jones Act and FELA cases that have followed it hold that, when the decedent extinguishes his own claim, he simultaneously forecloses any wrongful death action.  As Mr. Justice Holmes put it for a unanimous Court in <em>Flynn, supra,</em> the wrongful death action is "derivative and dependent upon the continuance of a right in the injured employee at the time of his death."  283 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/53/case.html#56">283 U. S. 56</a></span> (citation omitted).  Thus, the Court\'s opinion in this case creates a square conflict with one of the major bodies of maritime law that <em>Moragne</em> viewed as a source of guidance.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s implication that the Death on the High Seas Act [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  supports its departure from <em>Mellon, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#583">414 U. S. 583</a></span> n. 10, is, at best, conjectural.  In fact, no cases addressing the situation presented here appear to have arisen under that Act.  Conceivably, such a case could arise, because the High Seas Act, by its terms, covers deaths caused by injuries inflicted at sea, not simply deaths occurring on the high seas.  <em>Cf. Lacey v. L. W. Wiggins Airways, Inc.,</em> 95 F. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="600">Page 414 U. S. 600</a></p><p> Supp. 916 (Mass.1951). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Thus, it would be possible in theory for a person injured at sea to recover for his personal injuries and, following his death, for his survivors to attempt to bring suit under the High Seas Act.  But certainly the Act would not be read as allowing the subsequent action.  Such a result would conflict with the <em>Mellon</em> line of cases under the Jones Act and the FELA, producing precisely the lack of uniformity normally sought to be avoided in admiralty.  Moreover, the High Seas Act contains a substitution provision, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 765, that, by implication, forbids a wrongful death action following a decedent\'s judgment.  Section 765 provides that, if a person who suffers injuries within the scope of the Act dies during the pendency of his own personal injury action, <em>that</em> action may be transformed by a personal representative into a wrongful death action countenanced by the Act. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Surely this substitution provision evidences a congressional recognition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="601">Page 414 U. S. 601</a></p><p> that only one action or the other should be allowed to proceed to judgment.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reference in <em>Moragne</em> to the "strong concern for uniformity" in admiralty law, 398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#401">398 U. S. 401</a></span>, often repeated and often related to congressional policies underlying the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#396">398 U.

S. 401</a></span>-402, was not an expression of concern solely for intellectual consistency.</p>\n<p>"Such uniformity not only will further the concerns of both of the . . . Acts, but also will give effect to the constitutionally based principle that federal admiralty law should be \'a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country.\'  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/88/558/case.html">The Lottawanna,</a></span></em> 21 Wall. 558,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/88/558/case.html#575">88 U.

But the lack of uniformity produced by the majority\'s holding should be evident.  For example, whether a seaman\'s injuries occur on land or at sea will be determinative under the majority\'s approach.  If on land, the seaman will have the Jones Act as his admiralty-related remedy. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Under that Act and the <em>Mellon</em> line of cases, his own personal injury action will foreclose a subsequent wrongful death action -- a misfortune that would not have befallen him and his survivors if only he had been lucky enough to have been injured at sea.  This anomaly is not something, I suspect, the Court will long abide.  Since</p>\n<p>"[i]t has been consistently true in this branch of the law that whatever a seaman can get under one theory he can sooner or later get under all the others . . . , [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]"</p>\n<p>the Court\'s holding undoubtedly portends an express overruling of <em>Mellon</em> and its successors, cases that the Court bypasses today.</p>\n<p>Aside from the disunity in the law of admiralty inherent in its opinion, I fail to see how the Court can square </p><p><a class="page-number" name="602">Page 414 U. S. 602</a></p><p> its sweeping approach with <em>Moragne\'s</em> reliance on and admonition to draw by analogy from the federal statutes.  <em>E.g.,</em> 398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#400">398 U. S. 400</a></span>-402, 408.  <em>Moragne</em> envisioned a process of accommodation with those statutes, not their abrupt and near-total forced obsolescence.  In this regard, it might be noted that the Court has still not resolved many of the practical questions left open in <em>Moragne,</em> such as how to define the class of beneficiaries or an appropriate limitation period.  Presumably, in resolving such questions, the lower courts are to continue to rely on the admiralty wrongful death statutes.  Now they are placed in the interesting position of analogizing to statutes under which the very claim before them would be blocked.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Moragne</em> also counseled the lower courts to draw by analogy from the case law under the state wrongful death statutes.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#408">398 U. S. 408</a></span>.  Under the great majority of those statutes, whether of survival or true death act character, Mrs. Gaudet\'s cause of action would have been foreclosed by her husband\'s recovery. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="603">Page 414 U. S. 603</a></p><p> The Restatement of Torts is also in direct conflict with the position taken by the Court:</p>\n<p>"Although the death statutes create a new cause of action, both they and the survival statutes are dependent upon the rights of the deceased.  Hence, where no action could have been brought by the deceased had he not been killed, no right of action exists.  Likewise, a release by the deceased or a judgment either in his favor or, if won on the merits, in favor of the defendant, bars an action after his death. . . . [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]"</p>\n<p>Because of the likelihood of double recovery and the threat to repose inherent in the majority\'s holding, several leading commentators also favor the majority rule under the state wrongful death statutes. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  This is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="604">Page 414 U. S. 604</a></p><p> particularly true where, as here, the deceased, in his own action, has recovered his loss of earnings over his pre-accident life expectancy. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Even those opposed to the majority position under state law recognize the "force" of that view in such a case. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="605">Page 414 U. S. 605</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court devotes a major portion of its opinion to the elements of damages recoverable under <em>Moragne.</em> <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#584">414 U. S. 584</a></span>-591.  In particular, the Court embraces the Court of Appeals\' suggestion, 463 F.2d 1331, 1333 (CA5 1972), that Mrs. Gaudet is entitled to seek damages for loss of "society," including love, affection, care, attention, companionship, comfort, and protection.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#585">414 U. S. 585</a></span>-590.  Although I would not otherwise address the question of damages, because I believe that no cause of action exists here, I think it important to note that the Court\'s holding that loss of society may be recovered is a clear example of the majority\'s repudiation of the congressional purposes expressed in the two federal maritime wrongful death statutes. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  The traditional admiralty view is that such nonpecuniary damages are not recoverable under the Death on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act.</p>\n<p>The Death on the High Seas Act, by its terms, restricts recovery to pecuniary losses, [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] a restriction the lower </p><p><a class="page-number" name="606">Page 414 U. S. 606</a></p><p> federal courts have consistently read as excluding loss of consortium and similar nonpecuniary injuries to personal relationship, affections, and sentiments. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Because of its relationship to the FELA and its overlapping coverage with the Death on the High Seas Act, the Jones Act also has been read as forbidding recovery of the sentimental losses approved by the Court today. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Moreover, these well established damages principles under the to federal maritime wrongful death statutes, coupled with a concern for uniformity in admiralty law, have led most lower courts that have taken part in the continuing development of the <em>Moragne</em> cause of action to conclude that the affection-related damages endorsed by the Court are not recoverable under <em>Moragne.</em> [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  These courts have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="607">Page 414 U. S. 607</a></p><p> heeded <em>Moragne\'s</em> admonition not to fashion a whole new body of law, yet their holdings are disapproved by the majority.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#588">414 U. S. 588</a></span> n. 23.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The reasons underlying the extensive state and admiralty precedent contrary to the Court\'s holding that this action may be brought are not difficult to discern.  The majority\'s statement that this precedent rests not so much on policy as on "statutory limitations on the wrongful death action . . . ," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#579">414 U. S. 579</a></span>, is erroneous. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="608">Page 414 U. S. 608</a></p><p> large number of courts that have refused to adopt the majority\'s view have done so for very good, practical reasons.  The Court has adopted a rule that will be difficult to administer, that presents a serious risk of unfairness for those in petitioner\'s position, and that fails to foster the law\'s normal regard for finality.</p>\n<p>The majority\'s position requires it to establish procedures to prevent a double recovery of the elements of damages awarded Gaudet in his own lawsuit.  This is no easy task, as "[i]t should be obvious that, as yet, no satisfactory systematic solution to the whole [double recovery] problem has been found." [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  The Court adopts a collateral estoppel theory, and apparently would implement this by treating the injured seaman as a "fiduciary" for his dependents.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#593">414 U. S. 593</a></span>-594.  Apart from the utter novelty of this extension of the law of trusts and fiduciary duties, the majority\'s estoppel theory is hardly a "satisfactory solution" to the problem of unfair recoveries. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Apparently the Court intends to limit the elements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="609">Page 414 U. S. 609</a></p><p> of proof of damages that may be introduced at the second trial.  But this will in no way guarantee that the second trier of fact will succeed in compartmentalizing the allowable from the unallowable elements of damages in the second trial.  The highly conceptualized nature of the parsing of categories of damages undertaken by the Court suggests how unlikely it is that the majority\'s theoretical distinctions will be meaningful in practice.  And control by way of appellate review of the injustices that are bound to occur will be, practically speaking, an impossible task.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gaudet\'s judgment was given by a jury.  It would be unrealistic to assume that that verdict was restricted to an objective measurement of Gaudet\'s lost earnings plus the "value" of his pain and suffering.  In all likelihood, Gaudet\'s award reflected an element of the jury\'s concern for a permanently disabled working man.  As anyone who has tried jury cases knows, jury sympathy commonly overcomes a theoretical inability to recover for such intangibles as loss of society.  If Mrs. Gaudet is then allowed to recover in her subsequent lawsuit the full value, whatever that is, of her loss of love, attention, care, affection, companionship, comfort, and protection, she will be given a second opportunity to benefit from the imprecision built into any award for injuries that cannot be measured objectively.  The Gaudet family may well then receive substantially more than just compensation for its injuries.</p>\n<p>One expression of jury sympathy is commonplace, despite its conflict with the damages principles that, in theory control.  But certainly two opportunities for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 414 U. S. 610</a></p><p> jury sentiment cross the line between benignity and bonanza and should not be sanctioned.  And it is in those cases where the decedent\'s suit and the subsequent <em>Moragne</em> wrongful death action are both tried to juries that the majority\'s procedures for preventing a windfall are most likely to break down.  Since it is an admiralty action, a <em>Moragne</em> claim, by itself, will not entitle the wrongful death claimant to a jury.  But there will be cases in which the claimant will be able to join a state law action to a <em>Moragne</em> claim and obtain a jury for both, either in state or federal court.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/573/case.html#589">414 U. S. 589</a></span> n. 24.  When that happens, those in petitioner\'s position will be subjected twice to the vagaries of a jury, the second time on such wide-open damages concepts as those embraced by the majority.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s approval of a second recovery based on the same wrong for which decedent already had recovered, compounded by its rejection of traditional admiralty "pecuniary loss" damage standards, seems particularly inappropriate given the nature of the claim relied on by both Gaudets.  The maritime concept of unseaworthiness is not based on fault.  The doctrine has evolved into a judicially created form of strict liability. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  When the law imposes absolute liability, it often restricts recovery to damages for those injuries that are clearly ascertainable and susceptible of monetary compensation.  <em>E.g., Igneri v. Cie. de Transports Oceaniques,</em> 323 F.2d 257, 268 (CA2 1963), <em>cert. denied,</em> 376 U.S. 949 (1964).  This reflects the impossibility of deterrence and the inappropriateness of punishment in many cases where liability is absolute.  The Court has broken with that wise rule of social policy in this case. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 414 U. S. 611</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court also has ignored the law\'s normal regard for an end to duplicative litigation arising from the same transaction.  After her husband\'s judgment was affirmed on appeal, [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>] Mrs. Gaudet commenced this action by, in essence, changing a few lines in her husband\'s complaint and filing it again in the same United States District Court as a <em>Moragne</em> wrongful death action.  That court\'s dismissal of Mrs. Gaudet\'s complaint on <em>res judicata</em> grounds [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>] is hardly surprising, given the striking similarities between the two Gaudet complaints.  Both complaints were based on the maritime doctrine of unseaworthiness, a condition that Mrs. Gaudet alleged was established as a matter of <em>res judicata</em> by Mr. Gaudet\'s successful lawsuit.  App. 2, 5-6.  The same facts and injuries were alleged.  <em>Id.</em> at 1-2, 5.  Both sought recovery, in the amount of $250,000.  <em>Id.</em> at 2, 6.  Whereas Mr. Gaudet had sought recovery for lost earnings, <em>id.</em> at 2, Mrs. Gaudet sought compensation for her "severe financial loss."  <em>Id.</em> at 5.  Thus, on the face of the complaints, Mrs. Gaudet apparently sought recovery solely for elements of damages that had been encompassed by her husband\'s judgment. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>There should be strong reasons of policy to justify such repetitive suits and to impose on petitioner the attendant doubling of litigation expenses.  The reasons advanced by the majority opinion do not, in my view, approach that level of persuasion.  Petitioner has already fully litigated, and paid, a large judgment compensating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 414 U. S. 612</a></p><p> Gaudet\'s estate for the injuries Gaudet incurred on board its vessel.  Ordinarily, petitioner would have been able to consider the case closed and to order its affairs on the basis of a verdict affirmed on appeal.  Today\'s result deprives petitioner of that reliance interest, subjecting it to another round of litigation with wide-open damages possibilities.  The admiralty precedents, the prevailing weight of state law, and elementary fairness call for relieving petitioner of that unjustifiable burden.</p>\n<p>As noted at the outset of this dissent, the Court has written new admiralty law as to the right of survivors to recover for wrongful death, and has expanded significantly the elements of damages recoverable.  In reaching these results, the majority opinion has discredited, if not in substance overruled, the unanimous decisions of the Court in the <em>Mellon</em> and <em>Flynn</em> cases.  In <em>Moragne,</em> a decision on which I believe the majority places a mistaken reliance, the Court emphasized its reluctance to disregard or overrule established precedent:</p>\n<p>"Very weighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.  Among these are the desirability that the law furnish a clear guide for the conduct of individuals, to enable them to plan their affairs with assurance against untoward surprise; the importance of furthering fair and expeditious adjudication by eliminating the need to relitigate every relevant proposition in every case; and the necessity of maintaining public faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments.  The reasons for rejecting any established rule must always be weighed against these factors."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#403">398 U. S. 403</a></span>.  Mr. Justice Harlan, for the Court, then went on to state with care the reasons for rejecting <em>The Harrisburg</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 414 U. S. 613</a></p><p> rule, described as an "unjustifiable anomaly."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#404">398 U. S. 404</a></span>.  The substantive rule rejected today is no comparable anomaly.  It has been the generally applied doctrine since wrongful death actions were introduced in this country.  It has been the rule of the relevant federal statutes since their inception, and Congress has not modified the rule during that entire period.  It was the rule announced in <em>Mellon</em> and <em>Flynn, supra,</em> cases the Court chooses not to follow today.  And, unlike the opinion in <em>Moragne,</em> the majority has not provided, in my view, sound reasons of precedent or policy for overturning the rule.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688.  The Jones Act provides:</p>\n<p>"Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable.  Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located."</p>\n<p>Since the Act employs the terms "in the course of his employment . . . ," the cause of action it provides "follows from the seaman\'s employment status, and is not limited to injury or death occurring on the high seas."  <em>Moragne v.

But the majority ignores the extent to which the Court in <em>Moragne</em> expressly identified its holding with the policy and principles of the very statutes now criticized:</p>\n<p>"The policy thus established [by the state and federal wrongful death statutes] has become itself a part of our law, to be given its appropriate weight not only in matters of statutory construction but also in those of decisional law."</p>\n<p>398 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#390">398 U. S. 390</a></span>-391.  And again:</p>\n<p>"Both the Death on the High Seas Act and the numerous state wrongful death acts have been implemented with success for decades.  The experience thus built up counsels that a suit for wrongful death raises no problems unlike those that have long been grist for the judicial mill."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/375/case.html#408">398 U. S. 408</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court\'s intimations, there is no basis for suggesting a tension between these statutes and <em>Moragne.</em>  Indeed, it is clear from the <em>Moragne</em> opinion that the Court relied upon the statutes in its analysis, sought only to fill a narrow gap in the law left by them, and considered that the statutes afforded "persuasive analogy for guidance" in developing the <em>Moragne</em> cause of action.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>Prosser 912 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/21" name="F2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]</p>\n<p>The theory probably creates more problems than it resolves.  What are the boundaries of the class of potential beneficiaries who are estopped to relitigate loss of support?  If a seriously injured person is the fiduciary for an undefined class of potential beneficiaries, may he be enjoined from wasting his assets or disinheriting members of his family?  There will also be some nice questions under the majority\'s approach about whether a particular item of proof at the second trial is to be introduced with regard to the forbidden issue of support or the permissible issue of, say, services.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/22" name="F2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Moragne v.
