In 1959, the Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it \xe2\x80\x9call the public lands \xe2\x80\xa6 held by the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa75(b), and requiring these lands, \xe2\x80\x9ctogether with the proceeds from [their] sale \xe2\x80\xa6 , [to] be held by [the] State as a public trust,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa75(f).  Hawaii state law also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in trust for Hawaiian citizens.  In 1993, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 joint Apology Resolution \xe2\x80\x9capologize[d]\xe2\x80\x9d for this country\xe2\x80\x99s role in overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy, \xc2\xa71, and declared that nothing in the resolution was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cLeiali\xe2\x80\x99i parcel,\xe2\x80\x9d a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State since 1959 as part of the Admission Act \xc2\xa75(f) trust.  Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s affordable housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians.  After HFDC refused OHA\xe2\x80\x99s demand that the payment include a disclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or transfer of the Leiali\xe2\x80\x99i parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final determination of native Hawaiians\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  The state trial court entered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme Court vacated that ruling.  Relying on the Apology Resolution, the court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Admission Act and state law give the State explicit power to sell ceded lands.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction.

The first such provision\xe2\x80\x99s six verbs\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> Congress \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledge[d] the historical significance\xe2\x80\x9d of the monarchy\xe2\x80\x99s overthrow, \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\xe2\x80\x9d with native Hawaiians, \xe2\x80\x9capologize[d] to [them]\xe2\x80\x9d for the overthrow, \xe2\x80\x9cexpresse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrow\xe2\x80\x99s] ramifications,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9curge[d] the President \xe2\x80\xa6 to also acknowledge [those] ramifications,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x94are all conciliatory or precatory.  This is not the kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, especially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The resolution\xe2\x80\x99s second substantive provision, the \xc2\xa73 disclaimer, by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have \xe2\x80\x9cclaims against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The State Supreme Court, however, read \xc2\xa73 as a congressional recognition\xe2\x80\x94and preservation\xe2\x80\x94of claims <em>against Hawaii.  </em>There is no justification for turning an express disclaimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recognition of claims against another.

First, such \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas\xe2\x80\x9d clauses cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed on them.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa03.  Second, even if the clauses had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations, as the lower court found.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]epeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Assn. of Home Builders</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/644/index.html">551 U. S. 644</a>, ___.  The Apology Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest one.  Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional concerns if it purported to \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s title to its sovereign lands more than three decades after the State\xe2\x80\x99s admission to the Union, see, <em>e.g., Idaho</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/262/index.html">533 U.

Relying on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 joint resolution, the Supreme Court of Hawaii permanently enjoined the State from alienating certain of its lands, pending resolution of native Hawaiians\xe2\x80\x99 land claims that the court described as \xe2\x80\x9cunrelinquished.\xe2\x80\x9d  We reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1893, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] so-called Committee of Safety, a group of professionals and businessmen, with the active assistance of John Stevens, the United States Minister to Hawaii, acting with the United States Armed Forces, replaced the [Hawaiian] monarchy with a provisional government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Cayetano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/495/index.html">528 U.

Under the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii, effective upon its admission into the Union, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 title to all the public lands and other public property within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to which is held by the United States immediately prior to its admission into the Union.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa75(b), <em>id.</em>, at 5.

In a series of the preambular \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas\xe2\x80\x9d clauses, Congress made various observations about Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s history.

The Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HFDC)\xe2\x80\x94Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s affordable housing agency\xe2\x80\x94received approval to remove the Leiali\xe2\x80\x99i parcel from the \xc2\xa75(f) trust and redevelop it.  In order to transfer the Leiali\xe2\x80\x99i parcel out of the public trust, HFDC was required to compensate respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive and manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians.  Haw. Const., Art. XII, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, however, OHA demanded more than monetary compensation.

This Court has jurisdiction whenever \xe2\x80\x9ca state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html"></a><a href="/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U.

Neither justifies the judgment below.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The resolution\xe2\x80\x99s first substantive provision uses six verbs, all of which are conciliatory or precatory.  Specifically, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledge[d] the historical significance\xe2\x80\x9d of the Hawaiian monarchy\xe2\x80\x99s overthrow, \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\xe2\x80\x9d with native Hawaiians, \xe2\x80\x9capologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians\xe2\x80\x9d for the monarchy\xe2\x80\x99s overthrow, \xe2\x80\x9cexpresse[d] [Congress\xe2\x80\x99s] commitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9curge[d] the President of the United States to also acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71.  Such terms are not the kind that Congress uses to create substantive rights\xe2\x80\x94especially those that are enforceable against the cosovereign States.

By its terms, \xc2\xa73 speaks only to those who may or may not have \xe2\x80\x9cclaims <em>against the United States</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court below, however, held that the only way to save \xc2\xa73 from superfluity is to construe it as a congressional recognition\xe2\x80\x94and preservation\xe2\x80\x94of claims <em>against Hawaii</em> and as \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>foundation </em>(or starting point) for reconciliation\xe2\x80\x9d between the State and native Hawaiians.  117 Haw., at 192, 177 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 902.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have regard to all the words used by Congress, and as far as possible give effect to them,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.

See 107 Stat. 1510\xe2\x80\x931513.  \xe2\x80\x9cBased on a plain reading of\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas\xe2\x80\x9d clauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.\xe2\x80\x9d  117 Haw., at 191, 177 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 901.  That conclusion is wrong for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas\xe2\x80\x9d clauses like those in the Apology Resolution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed on them.  As we recently explained in a different context, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not have operative effect, such as \xe2\x80\x98whereas\xe2\x80\x99 clauses in federal legislation \xe2\x80\xa6 , a court has no license to make it do what it was not designed to do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller</em>, 554 U.

The Apology Resolution reveals no indication\xe2\x80\x94much less a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest\xe2\x80\x9d one\xe2\x80\x94that Congress intended to amend or repeal the State\xe2\x80\x99s rights and obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal law); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence that Congress intended <em>sub silentio</em> to \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d the title that the United States held in \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute fee\xe2\x80\x9d and transferred to the State in 1959.  On that score, we find it telling that even respondent OHA has now abandoned its argument, made below, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 enacted the Apology Resolution and thus \xe2\x80\xa6 change[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the Admission Act.

And that proposition applies <em>a fortiori</em> where virtually all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s public lands\xe2\x80\x94not just its submerged ones\xe2\x80\x94are at stake.  In light of those concerns, we must not read the Apology Resolution\xe2\x80\x99s nonsubstantive \xe2\x80\x9cwhereas\xe2\x80\x9d clauses to create a retroactive \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d on the title that Congress granted to the State of Hawaii in 1959.

Here, the State Supreme Court incorrectly held that Congress, by adopting the Apology Resolution, took away from the citizens of Hawaii the authority to resolve an issue that is of great importance to the people of the State.
