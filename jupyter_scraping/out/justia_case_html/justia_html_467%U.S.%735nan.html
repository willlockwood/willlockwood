The question before us is whether the Commission must notify the "target" of such an investigation when it issues a subpoena to a third party.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case represents one shard of a prolonged investigation by the SEC into the affairs of respondent Harry F. Magnuson and persons and firms with whom he has dealt.  The investigation began in 1980, when the Commission\'s staff reported to the Commission that information in their possession tended to show that Magnuson and others had been trading in the stock of specified mining companies in a manner violative of the registration, reporting, and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In response, the Commission issued a Formal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 467 U. S. 738</a></p><p> Order of Investigation [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] authorizing employees of its Seattle Regional Office to initiate a "private investigation" into the transactions in question and, if necessary, to subpoena testimony and documents "deemed relevant or material to the inquiry."  Complaint, Exhibit A, pp. 3-4.</p>\n<p>Acting on that authority, members of the Commission staff subpoenaed financial records in the possession of respondent Jerry T. O\'Brien, Inc. (O\'Brien), a broker-dealer firm, and respondent Pennaluna &amp; Co. (Pennaluna).  O\'Brien voluntarily complied, but Pennaluna refused to disgorge the requested materials.  Soon thereafter, in response to several inquiries by O\'Brien\'s counsel, a member of the SEC staff informed O\'Brien that it was a "subject" of the investigation.</p>\n<p>O\'Brien, Pennaluna, and their respective owners [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] promptly filed a suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, seeking to enjoin the Commission\'s investigation and to prevent Magnuson from complying with subpoenas that had been issued to him. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Magnuson filed a cross-claim, also seeking to block portions of the investigation. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="739">Page 467 U. S. 739</a></p><p>  O\'Brien then filed motions seeking authority to depose the Commission\'s officers and to conduct expedited discovery into the Commission\'s files. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court denied respondents\' discovery motions, and soon thereafter dismissed their claims for injunctive relief.  <em>Jerry T. O\'Brien, Inc. v. SEC,</em> No. C-81-546 (ED Wash., Jan. 20, 1982).  The principal ground for the court\'s decision was that respondents would have a full opportunity to assert their objections to the basis and scope of the SEC\'s investigation if and when the Commission instituted a subpoena enforcement action.  The court did, however, rule that the Commission\'s outstanding subpoenas [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] met the requirements outlined in <em>United States v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/48/case.html">379 U. S. 48</a></span> (1964), for determining whether an administrative summons is judicially enforceable.  Specifically, the District Court held that the Commission had a legitimate purpose in issuing the subpoenas, that the requested information was relevant and was not already in the Commission\'s possession, and that the issuance of the subpoenas comported with pertinent procedural requirements.</p>\n<p>Following the District Court\'s decision, the SEC issued several subpoenas to third parties.  In response, Magnuson and O\'Brien renewed their request to the District Court for injunctive relief, accompanying the request with a motion, pursuant to Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for a stay pending appeal.  For the first time, respondents expressly sought notice of the subpoenas issued by the Commission to third parties.  Reasoning that respondents lacked standing to challenge voluntary compliance with subpoenas </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 467 U. S. 740</a></p><p> by third parties, and that, in any subsequent proceeding brought by the SEC, respondents could move to suppress evidence the Commission had obtained from third parties through abusive subpoenas, the District Court denied the requested relief.  <em>Jerry T. O\'Brien, Inc. v. SEC,</em> No. C-81-546 (ED Wash., Mar. 25, 1982). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s denial of injunctive relief with regard to the subpoenas directed at respondents themselves, agreeing with the lower court that respondents had an adequate remedy at law for challenging those subpoenas. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  704 F.2d 1065, 1066-1067 (1983).  However, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s denial of respondents\' request for notice of subpoenas issued to third parties.  In the Court of Appeals\' view, "targets" of SEC investigations "have a right to be investigated consistently with the <em>Powell</em> standards."  <em>Id.</em> at 1068.  To enable targets to enforce this right, the court held that they must be notified of subpoenas issued to others.  <em>Id.</em> at 1069.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied the Commission\'s request for rehearing and rejected its suggestion for rehearing en banc.  719 F.2d 300 (1983).  Judge Kennedy, joined by four other judges, dissented from the rejection, arguing that the panel decision was unprecedented, and threatened the ability of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 467 U. S. 741</a></p><p> SEC and other agencies to conduct nonpublic investigations into possible violations of federal law.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari because of the importance of the issue presented.  464 U.S. 1038 (1984).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Congress has vested the SEC with broad authority to conduct investigations into possible violations of the federal securities laws and to demand production of evidence relevant to such investigations.  <em>E.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 77s(b), 78u(a), (b). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Subpoenas issued by the Commission are not self-enforcing, and the recipients thereof are not subject to penalty for refusal to obey.  But the Commission is authorized to bring suit in federal court to compel compliance with its process.  <em>E.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 77v(b), 78u(c). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>No provision in the complex of statutes governing the SEC\'s investigative power expressly obliges the Commission to notify the "target" of an investigation when it issues a subpoena to a third party.  If such an obligation is to be imposed on the Commission, therefore, it must be derived from one of three sources:  a constitutional provision; an understanding on the part of Congress, inferable from the structure of the securities laws, regarding how the SEC should conduct its inquiries; or the general standards governing judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="742">Page 467 U. S. 742</a></p><p> enforcement of administrative subpoenas enunciated in <em>United States v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/48/case.html">379 U. S. 48</a></span> (1964), and its progeny.  Examination of these three potential bases for the Court of Appeals\' ruling leaves us unpersuaded that the notice requirement fashioned by that court is warranted.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Our prior cases foreclose any constitutional argument respondents might make in defense of the judgment below.  The opinion of the Court in <em>Hannah v. Larche,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/420/case.html">363 U. S. 420</a></span> (1960), leaves no doubt that neither the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment nor the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is offended when a federal administrative agency, without notifying a person under investigation, uses its subpoena power to gather evidence adverse to him.  The Due Process Clause is not implicated under such circumstances, because an administrative investigation adjudicates no legal rights, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/420/case.html#440">363 U. S. 440</a></span>-443, and the Confrontation Clause does not come into play until the initiation of criminal proceedings, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/420/case.html#440">363 U. S. 440</a></span>, n. 16.  These principles plainly cover an inquiry by the SEC into possible violations of the securities laws.</p>\n<p>It is also settled that a person inculpated by materials sought by a subpoena issued to a third party cannot seek shelter in the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The rationale of this doctrine is that the Constitution proscribes only compelled self-incrimination, and, whatever may be the pressures exerted upon the person to whom a subpoena is directed, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the subpoena surely does not "compel" anyone else to be a witness against himself.  <em>Fisher v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html">425 U. S. 391</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#397">425 U. S. 397</a></span> (1976); <em>Couch v.

If the "target" of an investigation by the SEC has no Fifth Amendment right to challenge enforcement of a subpoena directed at a third </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 467 U. S. 743</a></p><p> party, he clearly can assert no derivative right to notice when the Commission issues such a subpoena.</p>\n<p>Finally, respondents cannot invoke the Fourth Amendment in support of the Court of Appeals\' decision.  It is established that, when a person communicates information to a third party, even on the understanding that the communication is confidential, he cannot object if the third party conveys that information or records thereof to law enforcement authorities.  <em>United States v. Miller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/case.html">425 U. S. 435</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/case.html#443">425 U. S. 443</a></span> (1976).  Relying on that principle, the Court has held that a customer of a bank cannot challenge on Fourth Amendment grounds the admission into evidence in a criminal prosecution of financial records obtained by the Government from his bank pursuant to allegedly defective subpoenas, despite the fact that he was given no notice of the subpoenas.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/case.html#443">425 U. S. 443</a></span>, and n. 5. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  <em>See also Donaldson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/517/case.html">400 U.

S. 522</a></span> (1971) (Internal Revenue summons directed to third party does not trench upon any interests protected by the Fourth Amendment). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  These rulings disable respondents from arguing that notice of subpoenas issued to third parties is necessary to allow a target to prevent an unconstitutional search or seizure of his papers.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The language and structure of the statutes administered by the Commission afford respondents no greater aid.  The provisions vesting the SEC with the power to issue and seek enforcement of subpoenas are expansive.  For example, \xc2\xa7 19(b) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 467 U. S. 744</a></p><p> of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 85-86, empowers the SEC to conduct investigations "which, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary and proper for the enforcement" of the Act and to</p>\n<p>"require the production of any books, papers, or other documents which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77s(b).  Similarly, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 21(a) and 21(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 899, 900, authorize the Commission to</p>\n<p>"make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any provision of this chapter [or] the rules or regulations thereunder,"</p>\n<p>and to demand to see any papers "the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 78u(a), (b). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>More generally, both statutes vest the SEC with "power to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement [their] provisions. . . ."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 77s(a), 78w(a)(1).  Relying on this authority, the SEC has promulgated a variety of rules governing its investigations, one of which provides that, "[u]nless otherwise ordered by the Commission, all formal investigative proceedings shall be non-public."  17 CFR \xc2\xa7 203.5 (1983).  In other words, the Commission has formally adopted the policy of not routinely informing anyone, including targets, of the existence and progress of its investigations. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  To our knowledge, Congress has never questioned this exercise by the Commission of its statutory power.  And, in another context, we have held that rulemaking authority comparable to that enjoyed by the SEC is broad enough to empower an agency to "establish </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 467 U. S. 745</a></p><p> standards for determining whether to conduct an investigation publicly or in private."  <em>FCC v. Schreiber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/279/case.html">381 U. S. 279</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/279/case.html#292">381 U. S. 292</a></span> (1965).</p>\n<p>It appears, in short, that Congress intended to vest the SEC with considerable discretion in determining when and how to investigate possible violations of the statutes administered by the Commission.  We discern no evidence that Congress wished or expected that the Commission would adopt any particular procedures for notifying "targets" of investigations when it sought information from third parties.</p>\n<p>The inference that the relief sought by respondents is not necessary to give effect to congressional intent is reinforced by the fact that, in one special context, Congress has imposed on the Commission an obligation to notify persons directly affected by its subpoenas.  In 1978, in response to this Court\'s decision in <em>United States v. Miller, supra,</em> [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] Congress enacted the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 92 Stat. 3697, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3401 <em>et seq.</em>  That statute accords customers of banks and similar financial institutions certain rights to be notified of and to challenge in court administrative subpoenas of financial records in the possession of the banks.  The most salient feature of the Act is the narrow scope of the entitlements it creates.  Thus, it carefully limits the kinds of customers to whom it applies, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3401(4), (5), and the types of records they may seek to protect, \xc2\xa7 3401(2).  A customer\'s ability to challenge a subpoena is cabined by strict procedural requirements.  For example, he must assert his claim within a short period of time, \xc2\xa7 3410(a), and cannot appeal an adverse determination until the Government has completed its investigation, \xc2\xa7 3410(d).  Perhaps most importantly, the statute is drafted in a fashion that minimizes the risk that customers\' objections to subpoenas will delay or frustrate agency investigations. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 467 U. S. 746</a></p><p>  Thus, a court presented with such a challenge is required to rule upon it within seven days of the Government\'s response, \xc2\xa7 3410(b), and the pertinent statutes of limitations are tolled while the claim is pending, \xc2\xa7 3419.  Since 1980, the SEC has been subject to the constraints of the Right to Financial Privacy Act.  Pub.L. 96-433, \xc2\xa7 3, 94 Stat. 1855, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78u(h)(1).  When it made the statute applicable to the SEC, however, Congress empowered the Commission in prescribed circumstances to seek <em>ex parte</em> orders authorizing it to delay notifying bank customers when it subpoenas information about them, thereby further curtailing the ability of persons under investigation to impede the agency\'s inquiries.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78u(h)(2).  Considerable insight into the legislators\' conception of the scope of the SEC\'s investigatory power can be gleaned from the foregoing developments.  We know that Congress recently had occasion to consider the authority of the SEC and other agencies to issue and enforce administrative subpoenas without notifying the persons whose affairs may be exposed thereby.  In response, Congress enacted a set of carefully tailored limitations on the agencies\' power, designed</p>\n<p>"to strike a balance between customers\' right of privacy and the need of law enforcement agencies to obtain financial records pursuant to legitimate investigations."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 951383, p. 33 (1978).  The manner in which Congress dealt with this problem teaches us two things.  First, it seems apparent that Congress assumed that the SEC was not and would not be subject to a general obligation to notify "targets" of its investigations whenever it issued administrative subpoenas. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Second, the complexity and subtlety of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 467 U. S. 747</a></p><p> procedures embodied in the Right to Financial Privacy Act suggest that Congress would find troubling the crude and unqualified notification requirement ordered by the Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The last of the three potential footings for the remedy sought by respondents is some other entitlement that would be effectuated thereby.  Respondents seek to derive such an entitlement from a combination of our prior decisions.  Distilled, their argument is as follows:  a subpoena issued by the SEC must comport with the standards set forth in our decision in <em>United States v. Powell,</em> 379 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/48/case.html#57">379 U. S. 57</a></span>-58. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 467 U. S. 748</a></p><p> only the recipient of an SEC subpoena, but also any person who would be affected by compliance therewith, has a substantive right, under <em>Powell</em> to insist that those standards are met.  A target of an SEC investigation may assert the foregoing right in two ways.  First, relying on <em>Reisman v. Caplin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/440/case.html">375 U. S. 440</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/440/case.html#445">375 U. S. 445</a></span> (1964), and <em>Donaldson v. United States,</em> 400 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/517/case.html#529">400 U. S. 529</a></span>, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] the target may seek permissive intervention in an enforcement action brought by the Commission against the subpoena recipient.  Second, if the recipient of the subpoena threatens voluntarily to turn over the requested information, the target "might restrain compliance" by the recipient, thereby forcing the Commission to institute an enforcement suit.  <em>See Reisman v. Caplin, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/440/case.html#450">375 U. S. 450</a></span>.  A target can avail himself of these options only if he is aware of the existence of subpoenas directed at others.  To ensure that ignorance does not prevent a target from asserting his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="749">Page 467 U. S. 749</a></p><p> rights, respondents conclude, the Commission must notify him when it issues a subpoena to a third party.</p>\n<p>There are several tenuous links in respondents\' argument.  Especially debatable are the proposition that a target has a substantive right to be investigated in a manner consistent with the <em>Powell</em> standards and the assertion that a target may obtain a restraining order preventing voluntary compliance by a third party with an administrative subpoena.  Certainly we have never before expressly so held.  For the present, however, we may assume, <em>arguendo,</em> that a target enjoys each of the substantive and procedural rights identified by respondents.  Nevertheless, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to elaborate upon those entitlements by mandating notification of targets whenever the Commission issues subpoenas.</p>\n<p>Two considerations underlie our decision on this issue.  First, administration of the notice requirement advocated by respondents would be highly burdensome for both the Commission and the courts.  The most obvious difficulty would involve identification of the persons and organizations that should be considered "targets" of investigations. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The SEC often undertakes investigations into suspicious securities transactions without any knowledge of which of the parties involved may have violated the law. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  To notify all potential wrongdoers in such a situation of the issuance of each subpoena would be virtually impossible.  The Commission would thus be obliged to determine the point at which enough evidence had been assembled to focus suspicion on a manageable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 467 U. S. 750</a></p><p> subset of the participants in the transaction, thereby lending them the status of "targets" and entitling them to notice of the outstanding subpoenas directed at others.  The complexity of that task is apparent.  Even in cases in which the Commission could identify with reasonable ease the principal targets of its inquiry, another problem would arise.  In such circumstances, a person not considered a target by the Commission could contend that he deserved that status, and therefore should be given notice of subpoenas issued to others.  To assess a claim of this sort, a district court would be obliged to conduct some kind of hearing to determine the scope and thrust of the ongoing investigation. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Implementation of this new remedy would drain the resources of the judiciary, as well as the Commission. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, the imposition of a notice requirement on the SEC would substantially increase the ability of persons who have something to hide to impede legitimate investigations by the Commission.  A target given notice of every subpoena issued to third parties would be able to discourage the recipients from complying, and then further delay disclosure of damaging information by seeking intervention in all enforcement actions brought by the Commission.  More seriously, the understanding of the progress of an SEC inquiry that would flow from knowledge of which persons had received subpoenas would enable an unscrupulous target to destroy or alter documents, intimidate witnesses, or transfer securities or funds, so that they could not be reached by the Government. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Especially in the context of securities regulation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 467 U. S. 751</a></p><p> where speed in locating and halting violations of the law is so important, we would be loathe to place such potent weapons in the hands of persons with a desire to keep the Commission at bay.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that our ruling may have the effect in practice of preventing some persons under investigation by the SEC from asserting objections to subpoenas issued by the Commission to third parties for improper reasons.  However, to accept respondents\' proposal "would unwarrantedly cast doubt upon and stultify the [Commission\'s] every investigatory move," <em>Donaldson v. United States,</em> 400 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/517/case.html#531">400 U. S. 531</a></span>.  Particularly in view of Congress\' manifest disinclination to require the Commission to notify targets whenever it seeks information from others, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/735/case.html#746">467 U. S. 746</a></span>-747, we refuse so to curb the Commission\'s exercise of its statutory power. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Nothing in this opinion should be construed to imply that it would be improper for the SEC to inform a target that it has issued a subpoena to someone else.  But, for the reasons indicated above, we decline to curtail the Commission\'s discretion to determine when such notice would be appropriate and when it would not.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>A Formal Order of Investigation is issued by the Commission only after its staff has conducted a preliminary inquiry, in the course of which "no process is issued [nor] testimony compelled."  17 CFR \xc2\xa7 202.5(a) (1983).  The purposes of such an order seem to be to define the scope of the ensuing investigation and to establish limits within which the staff may resort to compulsory process.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep.

Rather, they inform our determination whether adoption of the remedy proposed by respondents would comport with or disrupt the system of statutes governing the issuance and trading of securities, as that system has been modified and refined by Congress in the years since 1933.
