The facts were these: the brig and cargo, belonging to the plaintiffs, sailed on a voyage from New-York to Curocoa, and back again; but, upon the return voyage, she was captured by a British cruiser, and carried into Jamaica, where vessel and cargo were libelled and condemned, on the 31st of July 1804, for a breach of blockade. The captain, conceiving that the vessel would be sold under her value, requested Messrs. Campbell and O\'Harra, of Kingston, to buy her in for the owners, which was accordingly done, at the price of 1020l., equal to about 3,500 dollars. For the price of the vessel, amount of repairs, outfits, &amp;c. (in the whole 1939l. 4s. 11d.) advanced by Campbell and O\'Harra, those gentlemen took from the captain an hypothecation of the vessel, to guarantee the payment of a bill of exchange, which he drew upon the owners: and, on the 9th of August 1804, they requested Messrs. Savage and Dugan to procure insurance, upon the vessel for 5000 dollars; which was effected at the office of the Phoenix Insurance Company, upon the following instructions: </p><ul>\'Brig Hound, Thomas W.

The vessel sailed from Jamaica in August 1804; but was never heard of afterwards. At the expiration of a year, the Phoenix Insurance Company paid the amount of their subscription; but the defendants refused payment, on which this suit was instituted. </p><p> At the trial of the cause, the only disputed question was, whether the plaintiffs could go into evidence, to prove the actual value of the vessel insured; or were bound by the price, which was paid for her, under the condemnation, at Jamaica? On the first ground, the sums insured upon both policies, would be about the value; and, on the second ground, the amount received from the Phoenix Insurance Company, would be about sufficient to cover the loss.
