JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is very clear that there is no case of prize made out by the evidence.  The property, which was undoubtedly Wallis\', was therefore not enemy property; nor is there any evidence of intention to break the blockade or to trade with the enemy.  The case is so destitute of all the elements of prize that the present libel was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p>As to the other point more insisted on by the Attorney General.  The record as it stands shows that the vessel cleared for Hamburg when her destination was certainly Matamoras.  That her clearance was probably altered after she was at sea by writing over the word "Hamburg" the word "Matamoras."  That a false manifest was used, and the fact of the main cargo of two hundred and fifty-two cases of arms being on board was carefully concealed from the officers of the customs at New York, from which port she sailed.  It is not necessary to go any further into this evidence or to express any other opinion on it than to say that it presents a <em>prima facie</em> case of violation of municipal law which justifies further investigation.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>United States v. Weed,</em> <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/73/91/case.html">*</a></span> we had occasion at the last term to consider the question of the practice proper under such circumstances.  We then came to the conclusion that where sufficient evidence was found to justify it, the case would be remanded to the court below for an amendment of the libel or for such other proceedings as the government might, under all the circumstances, choose to adopt.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the district court, dismissing the libel in prize, is accordingly affirmed, but that part of the decree awarding restitution of the vessel and cargo is reversed with directions to allow libellant a reasonable time to file a new libel.  If this is not done within the time thus fixed by the court, the property to be restored by a new decree.</em></p>\n<p>* 5 Wall. 62.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
