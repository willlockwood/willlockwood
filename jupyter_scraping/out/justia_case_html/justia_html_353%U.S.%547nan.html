JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a companion case to No. 211, <em>Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/448/case.html">353 U. S. 448</a></span>.  Respondent union and petitioner employer entered into a collective bargaining agreement governing the hours of work, rates of pay, and working conditions in a Massachusetts plant owned by petitioner.  The agreement provided a procedure for the settlement of employee grievances, a procedure having four steps.  It also provided that, when the four steps had been exhausted, either party could, with exceptions not material here, submit the grievance to arbitration. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 353 U. S. 548</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The respondent filed written grievances, one asking higher pay for an employee and another complaining that an employee had been wrongfully discharged.  Both complaints were carried through the four steps.  The union, being dissatisfied, asked for arbitration.  The employer refused.  The union brought suit in the District Court to compel arbitration of the grievance disputes.  The District Court dismissed the bill, being of the view that the relief sought was barred by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 129 F.Supp. 665.  The Court of Appeals reversed, 233 F.2d 85.  It first held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement.  It then held that, while \xc2\xa7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 gave the District Court jurisdiction of the cause, it supplied no body of substantive law to enforce an arbitration agreement governing grievances.  But it found such a basis in the United States Arbitration Act, which it held applicable to these collective bargaining agreements.  It accordingly reversed the District Court judgment and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>We affirm that judgment and remand the cause to the District Court.  We follow in part a different path than the Court of Appeals, though we reach the same result.  As indicated in our opinion in No. 211, <em>Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, supra,</em> we think that \xc2\xa7 301(a) furnishes a body of federal substantive law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements in industries in commerce or affecting commerce, and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the issuance of an injunction to enforce the obligation to arbitrate grievance disputes.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 353 U.
