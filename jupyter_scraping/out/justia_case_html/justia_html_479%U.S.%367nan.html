S. 377</a></span>.</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On February 10, 1984, a police officer in Boulder, Colorado, arrested respondent Steven Lee Bertine for driving while under the influence of alcohol.  After Bertine was taken into custody and before the arrival of a tow truck to take Bertine\'s van to an impoundment lot, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] a backup officer </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 479 U. S. 369</a></p><p> inventoried the contents of the van.  The officer opened a closed backpack in which he found controlled substances, cocaine paraphernalia, and a large amount of cash.  Bertine was subsequently charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to dispense, sell, and distribute, and unlawful possession of methaqualone.  We are asked to decide whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the State from proving these charges with the evidence discovered during the inventory of Bertine\'s van.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p>The backup officer inventoried the van in accordance with local police procedures, which require a detailed inspection and inventory of impounded vehicles.  He found the backpack directly behind the front seat of the van.  Inside the pack, the officer observed a nylon bag containing metal canisters.  Opening the canisters, the officer discovered that they contained cocaine, methaqualone tablets, cocaine paraphernalia, and $700 in cash.  In an outside zippered pouch of the backpack, he also found $210 in cash in a sealed envelope.  After completing the inventory of the van, the officer had the van towed to an impound lot and brought the backpack, money, and contraband to the police station.</p>\n<p>After Bertine was charged with the offenses described above, he moved to suppress the evidence found during the inventory search on the ground, <em>inter alia,</em> that the search of the closed backpack and containers exceeded the permissible scope of such a search under the Fourth Amendment.  The Colorado trial court ruled that probable cause supported Bertine\'s arrest, and that the police officers had made the decisions to impound the vehicle and to conduct a thorough inventory search in good faith.  Although noting that the inventory of the vehicle was performed in a "somewhat slipshod" manner, the District Court concluded that</p>\n<p>"the search of the backpack was done for the purpose of protecting the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 479 U. S. 370</a></p><p> owner\'s property, protection of the police from subsequent claims of loss or stolen property, and the protection of the police from dangerous instrumentalities."</p>\n<p>App. 81-83.  The court observed that the standard procedures for impounding vehicles mandated a "detailed inventory involving the opening of containers and the listing of [their] contents."  <em>Id.</em> at 81.  Based on these findings, the court determined that the inventory search did not violate Bertine\'s rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  <em>Id.</em> at 83.  The court, nevertheless, granted Bertine\'s motion to suppress, holding that the inventory search violated the Colorado Constitution.</p>\n<p>On the State\'s interlocutory appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed.  706 P.2d 411 (1986).  In contrast to the District Court, however, the Colorado Supreme Court premised its ruling on the United States Constitution.  The court recognized that, in <em>South Dakota v. Opperman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html">428 U. S. 364</a></span> (1976), we had held inventory searches of automobiles to be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and that, in <em>Illinois v. Lafayette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html">462 U. S. 640</a></span> (1983), we had held that the inventory search of personal effects of an arrestee at a police station was also permissible under that Amendment.  The Supreme Court of Colorado felt, however, that our decisions in <em>Arkansas v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/753/case.html">442 U. S. 753</a></span> (1979), and <em>United States v. Chadwick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html">433 U. S. 1</a></span> (1977), holding searches of closed trunks and suitcases to violate the Fourth Amendment, meant that <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette</em> did not govern this case. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider the important and recurring question of federal law decided by the Colorado Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 479 U. S. 371</a></p><p> Court. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  475 U.S. 1081 (1986).  As that court recognized, inventory searches are now a well defined exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See Lafayette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html#643">462 U. S. 643</a></span>; <em>Opperman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#367">428 U. S. 367</a></span>-376.  The policies behind the warrant requirement are not implicated in an inventory search, <em>Opperman,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#370">428 U. S. 370</a></span>, n. 5, nor is the related concept of probable cause:</p>\n<p>"The standard of probable cause is peculiarly related to criminal investigations, not routine, noncriminal procedures. . . .  The probable cause approach is unhelpful when analysis centers upon the reasonableness of routine administrative caretaking functions, particularly when no claim is made that the protective procedures are a subterfuge for criminal investigations."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> <em>See also United States v. Chadwick, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#10">433 U. S. 10</a></span>, n. 5.  For these reasons, the Colorado Supreme Court\'s reliance on <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, supra,</em> and <em>United States v. Chadwick, supra,</em> was incorrect.  Both of these cases concerned searches solely for the purpose of investigating criminal conduct, with the validity of the searches therefore dependent on the application of the probable cause and warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>By contrast, an inventory search may be "reasonable" under the Fourth Amendment even though it is not conducted pursuant to a warrant based upon probable cause.  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 479 U. S. 372</a></p><p> <em>Opperman,</em> this Court assessed the reasonableness of an inventory search of the glove compartment in an abandoned automobile impounded by the police.  We found that inventory procedures serve to protect an owner\'s property while it is in the custody of the police, to insure against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property, and to guard the police from danger.  In light of these strong governmental interests and the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile, we upheld the search.  In reaching this decision, we observed that our cases accorded deference to police caretaking procedures designed to secure and protect vehicles and their contents within police custody.  <em>See Cooper v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/58/case.html">386 U. S. 58</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/58/case.html#61">386 U. S. 61</a></span>-62 (1967); <em>Harris v.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In our more recent decision, <em>Lafayette,</em> a police officer conducted an inventory search of the contents of a shoulder bag in the possession of an individual being taken into custody.  In deciding whether this search was reasonable, we recognized that the search served legitimate governmental interests similar to those identified in <em>Opperman.</em>  We determined that those interests outweighed the individual\'s Fourth Amendment interests, and upheld the search.</p>\n<p>In the present case, as in <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette,</em> there was no showing that the police, who were following standardized procedures, acted in bad faith or for the sole purpose of investigation.  In addition, the governmental interests justifying the inventory searches in <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette</em> are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 479 U. S. 373</a></p><p> nearly the same as those which obtain here.  In each case, the police were potentially responsible for the property taken into their custody.  By securing the property, the police protected the property from unauthorized interference.  Knowledge of the precise nature of the property helped guard against claims of theft, vandalism, or negligence.  Such knowledge also helped to avert any danger to police or others that may have been posed by the property. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Colorado opined that <em>Lafayette</em> was not controlling here because there was no danger of introducing contraband or weapons into a jail facility.  Our opinion in <em>Lafayette,</em> however, did not suggest that the station-house setting of the inventory search was critical to our holding in that case.  Both in the present case and in <em>Lafayette,</em> the common governmental interests described above were served by the inventory searches.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Colorado also expressed the view that the search in this case was unreasonable because Bertine\'s van was towed to a secure, lighted facility, and because Bertine himself could have been offered the opportunity to make other arrangements for the safekeeping of his property.  But the security of the storage facility does not completely eliminate the need for inventorying; the police may still wish to protect themselves or the owners of the lot against false claims of theft or dangerous instrumentalities.  And while giving Bertine an opportunity to make alternative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 479 U. S. 374</a></p><p> arrangements would undoubtedly have been possible, we said in <em>Lafayette:</em></p>\n<p>"[T]he real question is not what \'could have been achieved,\' but whether the Fourth Amendment <em>requires</em> such steps. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The reasonableness of any particular governmental activity does not necessarily or invariably turn on the existence of alternative \'less intrusive\' means."</p>\n<p><em>Lafayette,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html#647">462 U. S. 647</a></span> (emphasis in original).  <em>See Cady v. Dombrowski, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/433/case.html#447">413 U. S. 447</a></span>; <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html">428 U.

We conclude that here, as in <em>Lafayette,</em> reasonable police regulations relating to inventory procedures, administered in good faith, satisfy the Fourth Amendment, even though courts might, as a matter of hindsight, be able to devise equally reasonable rules requiring a different procedure. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Colorado also thought it necessary to require that police, before inventorying a container, weigh the strength of the individual\'s privacy interest in the container against the possibility that the container might serve as a repository for dangerous or valuable items.  We think that such a requirement is contrary to our decisions in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 479 U. S. 375</a></p><p> <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette,</em> and by analogy to our decision in <em>United States v. Ross,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/798/case.html">456 U. S. 798</a></span> (1982):</p>\n<p>"Even if less intrusive means existed of protecting some particular types of property, it would be unreasonable to expect police officers in the everyday course of business to make fine and subtle distinctions in deciding which containers or items may be searched and which must be sealed as a unit."</p>\n<p><em>Lafayette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html#648">462 U. S. 648</a></span>.</p>\n<p>"When a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Ross, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/798/case.html#821">456 U. S. 821</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We reaffirm these principles here:</p>\n<p>"\'[a] single familiar standard is essential to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Lafayette, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html#648">462 U. S. 648</a></span> (quoting <em>New York v. Belton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/case.html">453 U.

S. 458</a></span> (1981)).</p>\n<p>Bertine finally argues that the inventory search of his van was unconstitutional because departmental regulations gave the police officers discretion to choose between impounding his van and parking and locking it in a public parking place.  The Supreme Court of Colorado did not rely on this argument in reaching its conclusion, and we reject it.  Nothing in <em>Opperman</em> or <em>Lafayette</em> prohibits the exercise of police discretion, so long as that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.  Here, the discretion afforded the Boulder police was exercised in light of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 479 U. S. 376</a></p><p> standardized criteria, related to the feasibility and appropriateness of parking and locking a vehicle rather than impounding it. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  There was no showing that the police chose to impound Bertine\'s van in order to investigate suspected criminal activity.</p>\n<p>While both <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette</em> are distinguishable from the present case on their facts, we think that the principles enunciated in those cases govern the present one.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 7-7-2(a)(4) of the Boulder Revised Code authorizes police officers to impound vehicles when drivers are taken into custody.  Section 7-7-2(a)(4) provides:</p>\n<p>"A peace officer is authorized to remove or cause to be removed a vehicle from any street, parking lot, or driveway when:"</p>\n<p>"(4) The driver of a vehicle is taken into custody by the police department."</p>\n<p>Boulder Rev.

Opperman,</em> several courts have confronted the issue whether police may inventory the contents of containers found in vehicles taken into police custody.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Griffin,</em> 729 F.2d 475 (CA7) (upholding inventory search of package found in paper bag), <em>cert. denied,</em> 469 U.S. 830 (1984); <em>United States v.

I join the Court\'s opinion, but write separately to underscore the importance of having such inventories conducted only pursuant to standardized police procedures.  The underlying rationale for allowing an inventory exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant rule is that police officers are not vested with discretion to determine the scope of the inventory search.  <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html">428 U.

This absence of discretion ensures that inventory searches will not be used as a purposeful and general means of discovering evidence of crime.  Thus, it is permissible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 479 U. S. 377</a></p><p> for police officers to open closed containers in an inventory search only if they are following standard police procedures that mandate the opening of such containers in every impounded vehicle.  As the Court emphasizes, the trial court in this case found that the Police Department\'s standard procedures did mandate the opening of closed containers and the listing of their contents.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/367/case.html#374">479 U.

S. 375</a></span>-376.  This vital assertion is flatly contradicted by the record in this case.  The officer who conducted the inventory, Officer Reichenbach, testified at the suppression hearing that the decision not to "park and lock" respondent\'s vehicle was his "own individual discretionary decision."  Tr. 76.  Indeed, application of these supposedly standardized "criteria" upon which the Court so heavily relies would have yielded a different result in this case.  Since there was ample public parking adjacent to the intersection where respondent was stopped, consideration of "feasibility" would certainly have militated in favor of the "park and lock" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 479 U. S. 379</a></p><p> option, not against it.  I do not comprehend how consideration of "appropriateness" serves to channel a field officer\'s discretion; nonetheless, the "park and lock" option would seem particularly appropriate in this case, where respondent was stopped for a traffic offense and was not likely to be in custody for a significant length of time.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the record indicates that no standardized criteria limit a Boulder police officer\'s discretion.  According to a departmental directive, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] after placing a driver under arrest, an officer has three options for disposing of the vehicle.  First, he can allow a third party to take custody. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Second, the officer or the driver (depending on the nature of the arrest) may take the car to the nearest public parking facility, lock it, and take the keys. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Finally, the officer can do what was done in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 479 U. S. 380</a></p><p> this case: impound the vehicle, and search and inventory its contents, including closed containers. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Under the first option, the police have no occasion to search the automobile.  Under the "park and lock" option,</p>\n<p>"[c]losed containers that give no indication of containing either valuables or a weapon <em>may not be opened and the contents searched</em> (<em>i.e.,</em> inventoried)."</p>\n<p>App. 92-93 (emphasis added).  Only if the police choose the third option are they entitled to search closed containers in the vehicle.  Where the vehicle is not itself evidence of a crime, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] as in this case, the police apparently have totally unbridled discretion as to which procedure to use.  <em>See</em> 706 P.2d 411, 413, n. 3 (Colo. 1985) ("[T]he Boulder Police Department\'s regulations and rules do not require that an automobile be inventoried and searched in accordance with the procedures followed in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 479 U. S. 381</a></p><p> case").  Consistent with this conclusion, Officer Reichenbach testified that such decisions were left to the discretion of the officer on the scene.  App. 60.</p>\n<p>Once a Boulder police officer has made this initial completely discretionary decision to impound a vehicle, he is given little guidance as to which areas to search and what sort of items to inventory.  The arresting officer, Officer Toporek, testified at the suppression hearing as to what items would be inventoried:</p>\n<p>"That would I think be very individualistic as far as what an officer may or may not go into.  I think whatever arouses his suspicious [<em>sic</em>] as far as what may be contained in any type of article in the car."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 78.  In application, these so-called procedures left the breadth of the "inventory" to the whim of the individual officer.  Clearly, "[t]he practical effect of this system is to leave the [owner] subject to the discretion of the official in the field."  <em>Camara v. Municipal Court,</em> 387 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html#532">387 U. S. 532</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Inventory searches are not subject to the warrant requirement because they are conducted by the government as part of a "community caretaking" function, "totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute."  <em>Cady v. Dombrowski,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/433/case.html#441">413 U. S. 441</a></span>.  Standardized procedures are necessary to ensure that this narrow exception is not improperly used to justify, after the fact, a warrantless investigative foray.  Accordingly, to invalidate a search that is conducted without established procedures, it is not necessary to establish that the police actually acted in bad faith, or that the inventory was in fact a "pretext."  By allowing the police unfettered discretion, Boulder\'s discretionary scheme, like the random spot checks in <em>Delaware v. Prouse,</em> is unreasonable because of the "<em>grave danger\' of abuse of discretion."  440 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/case.html#662">440 U.

Even if the search in this case did constitute a legitimate inventory, it would nonetheless be unreasonable under this analysis.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court greatly overstates the justifications for the inventory exception to the Fourth Amendment.  Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority in <em>Opperman,</em> relied on three governmental interests to justify the inventory search of an unlocked glove compartment in an automobile impounded for overtime parking:  (i) "the protection of the owner\'s property while it remains in police custody"; (ii) "the protection of the police against claims or disputes over lost or stolen property"; and (iii) "the protection of the police from potential danger."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#369">428 U.

As JUSTICE POWELL\'s concurring opinion in <em>Opperman</em> reveals, however, only the first of these interests is actually served by an automobile inventory search.</p>\n<p>The protection-against-claims interest did not justify the inventory search either in <em>Opperman, see</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#378">428 U.

Indeed, the trial court\'s characterization of the inventory as "slipshod" is the height of understatement.

Tr. 40-41; App. 41-42.  His reports make no reference to other items of value, including respondent\'s credit cards, and a converter, a hydraulic jack, and a set of tire chains, worth a total of $125.  Tr. 41, 62-63.  The $700 in cash found in respondent\'s backpack, along with the contraband, appeared only on a property form completed later by someone other than Officer Reichenbach.  <em>Id.</em> at 81-82.  The interior of the vehicle was left in disarray, <em>id.</em> at 99, and the officer "inadvertently" retained respondent\'s keys -- including his house keys -- for two days following his arrest.  <em>Id.</em> at 116, 133-134.</p>\n<p>The third interest -- protecting the police from potential danger -- failed to receive the endorsement of a majority of the Court in <em>OPperman.</em>  After noting that "there is little danger associated with impounding unsearched vehicles," JUSTICE POWELL recognized that</p>\n<p>"there does not appear to be any effective way of identifying in advance those circumstances or classes of automobile impoundments which represent a greater risk."</p>\n<p>428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#378">428 U.

As with the charge of overtime parking in <em>Opperman,</em> there is nothing in the nature of the offense for which respondent was arrested that suggests he was likely to be carrying weapons, explosives, or other dangerous items.  <em>Cf.

While I continue to believe that preservation of property does not outweigh the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, I fail to see how preservation can even be asserted as a justification for the search in this case.  In <em>Opperman,</em> the owner of the impounded car was not available to safeguard his possessions, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#375">428 U.

S. 388</a></span>, n. 6 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  To expand the <em>Opperman</em> rationale to include containers in which the owner clearly has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Court relies on <em>Illinois v. Lafayette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html">462 U. S. 640</a></span> (1983).  Such reliance is fundamentally misplaced, however; the inventory in <em>Lafayette</em> was justified by considerations which are totally absent in this context.\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Lafayette,</em> we upheld a station-house inventory search of an arrestee\'s shoulder bag.  Notwithstanding the Court\'s assertions to the contrary, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/367/case.html#373">479 U. S. 373</a></span>, the inventory in that case was justified primarily by compelling governmental interests unique to the station house, preincarceration context.  There is a powerful interest in preventing the introduction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 479 U. S. 386</a></p><p> of contraband or weapons into a jail. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>"Arrested persons have also been known to injure themselves -- or others -- with belts, knives, drugs, or other items on their person while being detained.

Removing such items from persons about to be incarcerated is necessary to reasonable jail security; once these items have been identified and removed, "inventorying them is an entirely reasonable administrative procedure."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although <em>Lafayette</em> also involved the property justifications relied on in <em>Opperman,</em> I do not believe it can fairly be read to expand the scope of inventory searches where the pressing security concerns of the station house are absent.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Not only are the government\'s interests weaker here than in <em>Opperman</em> and <em>Lafayette,</em> but respondent\'s privacy interest is greater.  In upholding the search in <em>Opperman,</em> the Court emphasized the fact that the defendant had a diminished expectation of privacy in his automobile, due to "pervasive and continuing governmental regulation and controls, including periodic inspection and licensing requirements" and "the obviously public nature of automobile travel."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#368">428 U.

S. 387</a></p><p> fact that the defendant was in custody at the time the inventory took place.  462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/640/case.html#645">462 U. S. 645</a></span>-646.</p>\n<p>Here the Court completely ignores respondent\'s expectation of privacy in his backpack.  Whatever his expectation of privacy in his automobile generally, our prior decisions clearly establish that he retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in the backpack and its contents.  <em>See Arkansas v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/753/case.html">442 U. S. 753</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/753/case.html#762">442 U. S. 762</a></span> (1979) ("[L]uggage is a common repository for one\'s personal effects, and therefore is inevitably associated with the expectation of privacy"); <em>United States v. Chadwick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html">433 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/1/case.html#13">433 U. S. 13</a></span> (1977) ("[A] person\'s expectations of privacy in personal luggage are substantially greater than in an automobile").  Indeed, the Boulder police officer who conducted the inventory acknowledged that backpacks commonly serve as repositories for personal effects. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Thus, even if the governmental interests in this case were the same as those in <em>Opperman,</em> they would nonetheless be outweighed by respondent\'s comparatively greater expectation of privacy in his luggage.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Coolidge v.
