This case concerns the proper forum for judicial review when the MSPB dismisses such a case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Anthony Perry received notice that he would be terminated from his employment at the U.\xc2\xa0S. Census Bureau for spotty attendance.  Perry and the Bureau reached a settlement in which Perry agreed to a 30-day suspension and early retirement.  The settlement also required Perry to dismiss discrimination claims he had filed separately with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  After retiring, Perry appealed his suspension and retirement to the MSPB, alleging discrimination based on race, age, and disability, as well as retaliation by the Bureau for his prior discrimination complaints.  The settlement, he maintained, did not stand in the way, because the Bureau had coerced him into signing it.  But an MSPB administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Perry had failed to prove that the settlement was coerced.  Presuming Perry\xe2\x80\x99s retirement to be voluntary, the ALJ dismissed his case.  Because voluntary actions are not appealable to the MSPB, the ALJ observed, the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Perry\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  The MSPB affirmed, deeming Perry\xe2\x80\x99s separation voluntary and therefore not subject to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  If dissatisfied with the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the Board stated, Perry could seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit.  Perry instead sought review in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit, which, the parties later agreed, lacked jurisdiction.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held that the proper forum was the Federal Circuit and transferred the case there.  <i>Kloeckner </i>did not control<i>, </i>the court concluded, because it addressed dismissals on procedural grounds, not jurisdictional grounds. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The proper review forum when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on jurisdictional grounds is district court.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Government argues that employees must split their mixed claims, appealing MSPB nonappealability rulings to the Federal Circuit while repairing to the district court to adjudicate their discrimination claims.  Perry counters that the district court alone can resolve his entire complaint.  Perry advances the more sensible reading of the statutory prescriptions.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Kloeckner</i> announced a clear rule: \xe2\x80\x9c[M]ixed cases shall be filed in district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50; see <i>id.</i>, at 56.  The key to district court review is the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c<i>clai[m]</i> that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in \xc2\xa77702(a)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 56 (emphasis added).  Such a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction suffices to establish district court jurisdiction.  EEOC regulations are in accord, and several Courts of Appeals have similarly described mixed-case appeals as those <i>alleging</i> an adverse action subject to MSPB jurisdiction taken, in whole or in part, because of unlawful discrimination.  Perry, who \xe2\x80\x9ccomplain[ed] of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9callege[d] that the [personnel] action was based on discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d brought a mixed case, and district court jurisdiction was therefore proper.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) The Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed distinction\xe2\x80\x94between MSPB merits and procedural decisions, on the one hand, and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional rulings, on the other\xe2\x80\x94has multiple infirmities.  Had Congress wanted to bifurcate judicial review, sending merits and procedural decisions to district court and jurisdictional dismissals to the Federal Circuit, it could have said so.  See <i>Kloeckner</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 52.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s newly devised attempt to distinguish jurisdictional dismissals from procedural dismissals is a departure from its position in <i>Kloeckner</i>.<i> </i>Such a distinction, as both parties recognized in <i>Kloeckner</i>, would be perplexing and elusive.  The distinction between jurisdiction and the merits is also not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap.  And because the MSPB may issue rulings on alternate or multiple grounds, some \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d others procedural or substantive, allocating judicial review authority based on a separate rule for jurisdictional rulings may prove unworkable in practice.  Perry\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension of the complex statutory text, in contrast, serves \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he CSRA\xe2\x80\x99s objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cparallel litigation regarding the same agency action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Elgin</i> v. <i>Department of Treasury</i>,\n\n567 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.

If an employee asserts rights under the CSRA only, MSPB decisions, all agree, are subject to judicial review exclusively in the Federal Circuit.  \xc2\xa77703(b)(1).  If the employee asserts no civil-service rights, invoking only federal antidiscrimination law, the proper forum for judicial review, again all agree, is a federal district court, see <i>Kloeckner</i> v. <i>Solis</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n46 (2012)\n; the Federal Circuit, while empowered to review MSPB decisions on civil-service claims, \xc2\xa77703(b)(1)(A), lacks authority over claims arising under antidiscrimination laws, see \xc2\xa77703(c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When a complaint presents a mixed case, and the MSPB dismisses it, must the employee resort to the Federal Circuit for review of any civil-service issue, reserving claims under federal antidiscrimination law for discrete district court adjudication?  If the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on the merits, the parties agree, review authority lies in district court, not in the Federal Circuit.  In <i>Kloeckner</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50, 56, we held, the proper review forum is also the district court when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds, in <i>Kloeckner</i> itself, failure to meet a deadline for Board review set by the MSPB.  We hold today that the review route remains the same when the MSPB types its dismissal of a mixed case as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  As in <i>Kloeckner</i>, we are mindful that review rights should be read not to protract proceedings, increase costs, and stymie employees,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] but to secure expeditious resolution of the claims employees present.

The sole question here disputed: What procedural route may an employee in Perry\xe2\x80\x99s situation take to gain judicial review of the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional disposition of a complaint that alleges adverse action taken under the CSRA in whole or in part due to discrimination proscribed by federal law?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government argues, and the dissent agrees, that employees, situated as Perry is, must split their claims, appealing MSPB nonappealability rulings to the Federal Circuit while repairing to the district court for adjudication of their discrimination claims.  As Perry sees it, one stop is all he need make.  Exclusively competent to adjudicate \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77703(b)(2), the district court alone can resolve his entire complaint, Perry urges; the CSRA, he maintains, forces no bifurcation of his case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 7702(a)(1), the Government contends, marks a case as mixed only if the employee \xe2\x80\x9chas been affected by an action which the employee .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may appeal to the [MSPB].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15, 17\xe2\x80\x9319, 21.

Brief for Peti-tioner 19.  The MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s adverse ruling on the merits of his claim that the settlement was coerced, Perry argues, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not retroactively divest the MSPB of jurisdiction to render that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.  The key consideration, according to Perry, is not what the MSPB determined about appealability; it is instead the nature of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s <i>claim</i> that he had been \xe2\x80\x9caffected by an action [appealable] to the [MSPB]\xe2\x80\x9d (here, suspension for more than 14 days and involuntary removal, see \xc2\xa77512(1), (2)).

So too here: whether an employee \xe2\x80\x9chas been affected by anaction which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77702(a) (1)(A), turns on her well-pleaded allegations.  <i>Kloeckner</i>, EEOC regulations, and Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions are corroborative.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We announced a clear rule in <i>Kloeckner</i>: \xe2\x80\x9c[M]ixed cases shall be filed in district court.\xe2\x80\x9d  568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50.

The same observation could be made about bifurcating judicial review here, sending the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s merits and procedural decisions to district court, but its jurisdictional dismissals to the Federal Circuit.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to separate jurisdictional dismissals from procedural dismissals is newly devised.  In <i>Kloeckner</i>, the Government agreed with the employee that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno basis\xe2\x80\x9d for a procedure-jurisdiction distinction.  Brief for Respondent, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2012, No. 11\xe2\x80\x93184, p.\xc2\xa025, n.\xc2\xa03; see Reply to Brief in Opposition, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2012, No. 11\xe2\x80\x93184, pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x932 (stating employee\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with the Government that procedural and jurisdictional dismissals should travel together).

Now, in light of our holding in <i>Kloeckner</i> that procedural dismissals should go to district court, the Government has changed course, contending that MSPB procedural and jurisdictional dismissals should travel different paths.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A procedure-jurisdiction distinction for purposes of determining the court in which judicial review lies, as both parties recognized in <i>Kloeckner</i>, would be perplexing and elusive.  If a 30-day suspension followed by termination becomes nonappealable to the MSPB when the Board credits a release signed by the employee, one may ask why a determination that the employee complained of such adverse actions (suspension and termination) too late, <i>i.e.</i>, after a Board-set deadline, does not similarly render the complaint nonappealable.  In both situations, the Board disassociates itself from the case upon making a threshold determination.  This Court, like others, we note, has sometimes wrestled over the proper characterization of timeliness questions.  Compare <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Russell</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205\n\xe2\x80\x93211, 215 (2007) (timely filing of notice of appeal in civil cases is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d), with <i>id.</i>, at 217\xe2\x80\x93219 (Souter, J., dissenting) (timeliness of notice of appeal is a procedural issue).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just as the proper characterization of a question as jurisdictional rather than procedural can be slippery, the distinction between jurisdictional and merits issues is not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap.  See <i>Shoaf</i> v. <i>Department of Agriculture</i>, 260 F.\xc2\xa03d 1336, 1341 (CA Fed. 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[ing] that the MSPB\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are inextricably intertwined\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This case fits that bill.  The MSPB determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Perry\xe2\x80\x99s civil-service claims on the ground that he voluntarily released those claimsby entering into a valid settlement with his employing agency, the Census Bureau.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  But the validity of the settlement is at the heart of the dispute on the <i>merits</i> of Perry\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  In essence, the MSPB ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because Perry\xe2\x80\x99s claims fail on the merits.  See <i>Shoaf</i>, 260 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1341 (If it is established that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cnot only [does the Board] ha[ve] jurisdiction, but also the employee wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See also <i>Conforto</i>, 713 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1126 (Dyk, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t cannot be that [the Federal Circuit] lack[s] jurisdiction to review the \xe2\x80\x98merits\xe2\x80\x99 of mixed cases but nevertheless may review \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99 issues that are identical to the merits .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Distinguishing between MSPB jurisdictional rulings and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s procedural or substantive rulings for purposes of allocating judicial review authority between district court and the Federal Circuit is problematic for a further reason: In practice, the distinction may be unworkable.  The MSPB sometimes rules on alternate grounds, one typed \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d another either procedural or substantive.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Davenport</i> v. <i>Postal Service</i>, 97 MSPR\xc2\xa0417 (2004) (dismissing \xe2\x80\x9cfor lack of jurisdiction <i>and</i> as untimely filed\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  To which court does appeal lie?  Or, suppose that the Board addresses a complaint that encompasses multiple claims, dismissing some for want of jurisdiction, others on procedural or substantive grounds.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Donahue</i> v. <i>Postal Service</i>, 2006 WL 859448, *1, *3 (ED Pa., Mar. 31, 2006).  Tellingly, the Government is silent on the proper channeling of appeals in such cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Desirable as national uniformity may be,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>] it should not override the expense, delay, and inconvenience of requiring employees to sever inextricably related claims, resorting to two discrete appellate forums, in order to safeguard their rights.  Perry\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension of the complex statutory text, we are persuaded, best serves \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he CSRA\xe2\x80\x99s objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cparallel litigation regarding the same agency action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Elgin</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 14.

No doubt his invitation is well meaning.  But it\xe2\x80\x99s one we should decline all the same.  Not only is the business of enacting statutory fixes one that belongs to Congress and not this Court, but taking up Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s invitation also seems sure to spell trouble.  Look no further than the lower court decisions that have already ventured where Mr. Perry says we should follow.  For every statutory \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d they have offered, more problems have emerged, problems that have only led to more \xe2\x80\x9cfixes\xe2\x80\x9d still.  New challenges come up just as fast as the old ones can be gaveled down.  Respectfully, I would decline Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s invitation and would instead just follow the words of the statute as written.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our case concerns the right of federal employees to pursue their employment grievances under the Civil Service Reform Act.  Really, it concerns but a small aspect of that right.  Everyone agrees that employees may contest certain adverse employment actions\xe2\x80\x94generally serious ones like dismissals\xe2\x80\x94before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77701\xe2\x80\x937702, 7512\xe2\x80\x937513.  Everyone agrees, too, that employees are generally entitled to seek judicial review of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  See \xc2\xa77703.  The only question we face today is where.  And on that question, the Act provides clear directions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the rule.  The Act says that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s appeal usually \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Federal Circuit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77703(b)(1)(A), which then applies a deferential, APA-style standard of review familiar to administrative law, \xc2\xa77703(c).  No doubt this makes sense, too, for Congress established the Federal Circuit in no small part to ensure a uniform case law governs Executive Branch personnel actions and guarantees the equal treatment of civil servants without regard to geography.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fausto</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 439,\n449 (1988)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the exception.  Congress recognized that sometimes agencies taking adverse employment actions against employees violate not just federal civil service laws, but also federal antidiscrimination laws.  Usually, of course, employees who wish to pursue discrimination claims in federal district court must first exhaust those claims in proceedings before their employing agency.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c).  But the Act provides another option.  Employees affected by adverse employment actions that trigger the Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction may (but need not) elect to exhaust their discrimination claims before the Board.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77702(a).  They also may ask the Board to review discrimination claims already exhausted before their employing agencies, and in this way obtain an additional layer of administrative review.  See <i>ibid</i>.  In \xc2\xa77702 of the Act, Congress proceeded to set forth the rules the Board must apply in reviewing these cases of discrimination.  And it then said that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702\xe2\x80\x9d are exempt from the default rule of Federal Circuit review and instead \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed\xe2\x80\x9d in district court \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d specified antidiscrimination statutes like Title VII or the ADEA.  \xc2\xa77703(b)(2).  At that point, district courts are instructed to engage in <i>de novo</i> factfinding, \xc2\xa77703(c), not APA-style judicial review, just as they would in any other discrimination lawsuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Putting these directions together, the statutory scheme is plain.  Disputes arising under the civil service laws head to the Federal Circuit for deferential review; discrimination cases go to district court for <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review.  Congress allowed employees an elective option to bring their discrimination claims to the Board, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow this option to destroy the framework it established for the resolution of civil service questions.  These rules provide straightforward direction to courts and guidance to federal employees who often proceed <i>pro se</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These rules also tell us all we need to know to resolve our case.  Construing his <i>pro\xc2\xa0se </i>filings liberally, Mr. Perry pursued civil service and discrimination claims before the Board without first exhausting his discrimination claim before his own agency.  The Board held that it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s claims because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t suffered an adverse employment action sufficient to trigger its jurisdiction under the Act.  Mr. Perry now seeks to contest the Board\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of its jurisdiction and win a review there that so far he\xe2\x80\x99s been denied.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Petitioner 24.  No doubt, too, he wants the chance to proceed on the merits before the Board for good reason: A victory there is largely unappealable by the government.  See 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77701, 7703(d); see also Brief for Respondent 34.  And because the scope of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction is a question of civil service law, Mr. Perry must go to the Federal Circuit for his answer.  If that court agrees with Mr. Perry about the scope of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s authority, he can return to the Board and argue the merits of his two claims.  If instead the court agrees with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of its powers, then Mr. Perry still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost his chance to pursue his remaining discrimination claim, for he may seek to exhaust that claim in the normal agency channels and proceed to district court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mr. Perry, though, invites us to adopt a very different regime, one that would have the <i>district court</i> review the Board\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the scope of its jurisdiction.  Having to contest Board rulings on civil service and discrimination issues in different courts, he says, is a hassle.  So, he submits, we should fix the problem by allowing civil service law questions to proceed to district court whenever an employee pursues a case of discrimination before the Board.  In support of his proposal, he points us to a line of lower court cases associated with <i>Williams </i>v.<i> Department of Army</i>.  And there, indeed, the Federal Circuit adopted a fix much like what Mr. Perry now proposes: allowing civil service claims to tag along to district court with discrimination claims because, in its judgment, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom the standpoint of judicial economy, consideration of all issues by a single tribunal is clearly preferable.\xe2\x80\x9d  715 F.\xc2\xa02d 1485, 1490 (1983) (en banc).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s is an invitation I would run from fast.  If a statute needs repair, there\xe2\x80\x99s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s called legislation.  To be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real and the process can be protracted.  But the difficulty of making new laws isn\xe2\x80\x99t some bug in the constitutional design: it\xe2\x80\x99s the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.  Besides, the law of unintended consequences being what it is, judicial tinkering with legislation is sure only to invite trouble.  Just consider the line of lower court authority Mr. Perry asks us to begin replicating now in the U.\xc2\xa0S. Reports.  Having said that district courts should <i>sometimes</i> adjudicate civil service disputes, these courts have quickly and necessarily faced questions about <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> they should do so.  And without any guidance from Congress on these subjects, the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 solutions have only wound up departing further and further from statutory text\xe2\x80\x94and invited yet more and more questions still.  A sort of rolling, case-by-case process of legislative amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take this one.  Recall that the statute says that <i>de novo </i>standard of review applies to cases filed in district court.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77703(c).  But everyone agrees that standard is poorly adapted to the review of administrative civil service decisions.  So what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done with civil service disputes that tag along to district court?  Rather than see the problem as a clue things have gone awry, lower courts following <i>Williams</i> have suggested that maybe civil service claims should be assessed under deferential standards of review the Act prescribes only for (yes) <i>Federal Circuit</i> cases.  And today Mr. Perry encourages us to follow suit too.  See<i> </i>Brief for Petitioner 17, n.; <i>Sher</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>, 488 F.\xc2\xa03d 489, 499 (CA1 2007), cert. denied,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1309 (2008)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning.  The statute allows only cases \xe2\x80\x9cfiled under\xe2\x80\x9d certain specified federal antidiscrimination statutes to proceed to district court.  Those laws (of course) prescribe remedies to vindicate harms associated with discrimination, including equitable relief and damages.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(c).  But what remedies canor should a district court afford a plaintiff in a run-of-the-mill civil service dispute that lands there?  Might a plaintiff be forced to litigate in the district court only to be told at the end that no remedial authority exists?  May a district court fashion some remedy in the absence of a statutory mandate to do so?  Should it only adopt APA-style remedies prescribed by the Act for (again) the <i>Federal Circuit</i>?  Who knows.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Answer all those questions and still more arise.  What happens if the Board<i> </i>fully remedies an employee\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination claim, but rejects his simultaneously litigated civil service dispute?  Should the employee go to district court with a stand-alone civil service complaint, to be nominally \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d and adjudicated \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d a federal antidiscrimination statute?  Or has by this point the case somehow transformed into one that should be sent to the Federal Circuit?  <i>Williams</i> itself anticipated these particular problems but (notably) declined to take any stab at answering them.  See 715 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1491.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Still more and even curiouser questions follow.  In some cases a district court will find the employee\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination claim meritless.  When that happens, what should the district court do with a tag along civil service claim?  Some lower courts after <i>Williams</i> have suggested that cases like these should be transferred back to the Federal Circuit in the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of judicial economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nater </i>v. <i>Riley</i>, 114 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 17, 29 (PR 2000).  But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it more than a little strange that an employee (often proceeding <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i>,<i> </i>no less) should be sent to district court only to be bounced back to the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94with each trip undertaken in the name of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial economy\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And speaking of judicial economy, you might wonder what happened to the (no doubt efficient) policy Congress itself articulated when it declared that civil service issues should be decided by the Federal Circuit so they might be subject to a uniform body of appellate case law.  See <i>Fausto</i>,<i> </i>484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 449; see also <i>Elgin</i> v. <i>Department of Treasury</i>,\n\n567 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (2012).  In an effort to achieve a simulacrum of that statutory command, one Federal Circuit judge has suggested that the regional circuits hearing tag along civil service issues should defer to Federal Circuit interpretations of civil service laws, much as federal courts defer to state courts on matters of state law when sitting in diversity.  See <i>Williams</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1492\xe2\x80\x931493 (Nichols, J., concurring).  Call it a sort of <i>Erie </i>doctrine<i> </i>for the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94if, of course, one lacking any basis in federalism, not to mention the statutory text.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By this point, you might wonder too if accepting Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s invitation will even wind up saving him (or those like him) any hassle at all.  Not only because of all the complications that arise from accepting his invitation.  But also because, regardless which court hears his case, Mr. Perry should wind up in the same place anyway.  If the reviewing court (whichever court that may be) finds that the Board was wrong and it actually possessed jurisdiction over his civil service and discrimination claims, presum-ably the court will seek to send Mr. Perry back to the Board to adjudicate those claims.  See Reply Brief 18 (agreeing with this point).  Meanwhile, if the reviewing court concludes that the Board was right and it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s claims, presumably the court will require him to exhaust his remaining discrimination claim in normal agency channels before litigating it in court.  So even if we take up Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious invitation to overhaul the statute, is it even clear that we would save him and those like him any<i> </i>hassle at all?  Or might future courts respond to this development with a yet further statutory rewrite, suggesting next that claimants should be allowed to proceed in district court on the merits of both their civil service and discrimination claims?  Even where (as here) the discrimination claim remains unexhausted before any agency and the civil service claim isn\xe2\x80\x99t one even the Board could hear?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for us may be seriously atextual and practically unattractive, but perhaps it has one thing going for it, he says.  While we of course owe no fealty to <i>Williams</i> or other lower court opinions, and are free to learn from, rather than repeat, their misadventures, Mr. Perry suggests our decision in <i>Kloeckner</i> v. <i>Solis</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41 (2012)\n, requires us to rule for him.  Whatever we think about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms, he says, we are bound by precedent to send him to district court all the same.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see in <i>Kloeckner </i>what Mr. Perry would have us find there.  This Court was not asked to decide\xe2\x80\x94and did not decide\xe2\x80\x94whether issues arising under the civil service laws go to district court.  Rather, we were askedto answer the much more prosaic question where an employee seeking to pursue <i>only</i> a discrimination claim should proceed.  See Pet. for Cert. in <i>Kloeckner </i>v. <i>Solis</i>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2012, No. 11\xe2\x80\x93184, p. i (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the [Board] decides a mixed case without determining the merits of <i>the discrimination claim</i>, is the court with jurisdiction over <i>that claim</i> the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court?\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And this Court simply (and quite rightly) responded to that question by holding that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] federal employee who <i>claims</i> that an agency action appealable to the [Board] <i>violates an antidiscrimination statute</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whether the [Board] decided her case on procedural grounds or instead on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kloeckner</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56 (emphasis added).  Nothing about the question presented or holding suggests that a claimant wishing to challenge a Board ruling under the civil service laws may also proceed in district court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mr. Perry replies that <i>Kloeckner</i> endorsed the idea that something called \xe2\x80\x9cmixed cases\xe2\x80\x9d should go to district court.  But that term does not mean what he thinks it means.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmixed case\xe2\x80\x9d appears nowhere in the statute.  Instead, it is but \xe2\x80\x9clingo [from] the applicable regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 50.  And even those regulations don\xe2\x80\x99t say that civil service questions may go to district court.  Instead, the regulations use the term \xe2\x80\x9cmixed cases\xe2\x80\x9d to describe administrative challenges where the employee both \xe2\x80\x9ccomplains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to [the Board] <i>and</i> alleges that the action <i>was based on discrimination.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 44 (second emphasis added); see also 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.302(a)(2) (2016).  The regulations thus simply acknowledge that some administrative matters are both sufficient to trigger the Board\xe2\x80\x99s authority and raise questions addressed by federal antidiscrimination statutes.  They say <i>nothing </i>about what goes to district court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither did <i>Kloeckner</i> redefine the term \xe2\x80\x9cmixed case\xe2\x80\x9d in some novel way.  After discussing the regulatory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmixed cases,\xe2\x80\x9d the decision proceeds to say just this: </p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cUnder \xc2\xa77703(b)(2), \xe2\x80\x98cases of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x99 shall be filed in district court.  Under \xc2\xa77702(a)(1), <i>the \xe2\x80\x98cases of discrimination subject to [\xc2\xa77702]\xe2\x80\x99 are mixed cases</i>\xe2\x80\x94those appealable to the [Board] and alleging discrimination.  Ergo, mixedcases shall be filed in district court.\xe2\x80\x9d 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50 (some brackets in original; emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In context, it seems clear that this passage only seeks to restate the statute, using the term \xe2\x80\x9cmixed cases\xe2\x80\x9d as shorthand for cases that go to district court under \xc2\xa77703(b)(2).  And from that statute we know that only \xe2\x80\x9ccases of discrimination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. filed under\xe2\x80\x9d certain specified federal antidiscrimination statutes go to district court\xe2\x80\x94no more, no less.  Nothing in this passage suggests the Court meant to rewrite a regulatory term as a tool to undo a statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Now, admittedly, a footnote in <i>Kloeckner</i> did seem to go a step farther and assume <i>Williams</i>\xe2\x80\x99 view that civil service claims may tag along with discrimination claims to district court.  <i>Kloeckner</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356, n.\xc2\xa04.  But even by its terms such an assumption wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help Mr. Perry, for he isn\xe2\x80\x99t seeking to pursue a discrimination claim in district court.  By his own telling, he is seeking to overturn the Board\xe2\x80\x99s holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his administrative appeal so he might seek relief there in the first instance.  And that, of course, raises only a question of civil service law.  What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the footnote\xe2\x80\x99s discussion about <i>Williams </i>is no more than dicta.  The footnote addressed only a policy argument from the government and said that argument failed both under <i>Williams</i> and for other reasons \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any event.\xe2\x80\x9d  568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56, n.\xc2\xa04.  As near as I can tell, then, Mr. Perry would have us upend a carefully crafted statutory scheme on the strength of a comment in one sentence of one footnote offered in reply to a policy argument that failed for other reasons anyway.  Full respect for <i>stare decisis</i> does not demand so much from us.  To the contrary, this Court has long made clear that where, as here, we have not \xe2\x80\x9csquarely addressed [an] issue, and have at most assumed [one side of it to be correct], we are free to address the issue on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abrahamson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619,\n631 (1993)\n; see also <i>Legal</i> <i>Services Corporation</i> v. <i>Valazquez</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 533,\n537 (2001)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cJudicial decisions do not stand as binding \xe2\x80\x98precedent\xe2\x80\x99 for points that were not raised, not argued, and hence not analyzed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notably, even the Court today doesn\xe2\x80\x99t read <i>Kloeckner </i>as holding that all civil service claims and issues must proceed to district court after a discrimination claim is presented to the Board.  Instead, the Court says that result is justified in large measure because it will \xe2\x80\x9cbest serv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined\xe2\x80\x99 by \xe2\x80\x98parallel litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i> at 16 (quoting <i>Elgin</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 14).  Yet, the very case the Court quotes for its account about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose (<i>Elgin</i> which, in turn, quotes <i>Fausto</i>) speaks of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to provide an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for civil service disputes that \xe2\x80\x9cwould be seriously undermined\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cemployees [had] the right to challenge employing agency actions in district court across the country,\xe2\x80\x9d and regional district and circuit courts could pass on such matters.  <i>Elgin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (quoting <i>Fausto</i>, 484 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 445).  And, respectfully, the result <i>Elgin</i> and <i>Fausto </i>warned against is <i>exactly </i>the result the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion seems sure to guarantee.  Rather than pursue the congressional policy discussed in those cases, the Court seems more nearly headed in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beyond its claim about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, the Court offers little in the way of a traditional statutory interpretation.  It does not explain how the result it reaches squares with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure, or grapple with the arguments presented here on those counts.  The Court does not explain, for example, how exactly a civil service dispute might be said to be \xe2\x80\x9cfiled under\xe2\x80\x9d a federal antidiscrimination statute, what the standard of review might apply in such a matter (nowhere discussed in the statute), or what the remedial powers of the district court could be in these circumstances.  And it remains far from obvious whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s eventual answers to questions like these will wind up yielding a regime better for employees, or instead one just different or even a good deal worse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, the only answer the Court supplies to any of the questions raised above lies in a footnote and seems telling.  There, the Court instructs that Mr. Perry will not be able to pursue his discrimination claim if the district court agrees with the Board that it lacked jurisdiction over his claim.  <i>Ante</i>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa010.  But this will surely come as a surprise to Mr. Perry, who tells us he wants to pursue a federal discrimination claim even if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t one the Board has jurisdiction to hear.  And it comes as a surprise to me too, for as I\xe2\x80\x99ve described and the government concedes, nothing in the statute would prevent Mr. Perry from trying to bring a discrimination claim in district court after seeking to exhaust it before his employing agency.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioner 11, 16\xe2\x80\x9317, 28; Brief for Respondent 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the end of a long day, I just cannot find anything preventing us from applying the statute as written\xe2\x80\x94or heard any good reason for deviating from its terms.  Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even clear how overhauling the statute as Mr. Perry wishes would advance the efficiency rationale he touts.  The only thing that seems sure to follow from accepting his invitation is all the time and money litigants will spend, and all the ink courts will spill, as they work their way to a wholly remodeled statutory regime.  Respectfully, Congress already wrote a perfectly good law.  I would follow it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
