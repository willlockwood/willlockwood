Petitioner was arrested and convicted in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="941">Page 414 U.S. 940 , 941</a></p><p> Justice of the Peace Court for Platte County, Wyoming, of the misdemeanor offense of being a minor in possession of alcoholic beverages. A few months later petitioner was charged and convicted in the District Court of Platte County with feloniously counselling and encouraging Anderson to commit grand larceny. The Supreme Court of Wyoming affirmed, rejecting petitioner\'s claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy, Mullin v.
