Sherman respectfully represents:"</p>\n<p>"On the 28th day of October, 1885, in the City Court of New York, in the Southern District of New York, an action was commenced by the service of a summons and complaint, by Irving Grinnell and George S. Bowdon, as executors, against this petitioner, to recover the sum of $1,778.95, and on the 30th day of said October, your petitioner presented his petition and a bond to said city court, and prayed the removal of said action to the circuit court of the United States for said district.  Said city court on that day made its order thereupon accepting said petition and approving </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 124 U. S. 365</a></p><p> said bond, and that said city court proceed no further in said action."</p>\n<p>"The ground alleged for such removal was that said action was of a civil nature, and one arising under the laws of the United States.  It was by said petition alleged that the grounds of such removal appeared by the complaint of the plaintiffs in said action."</p>\n<p>"On the 26th day of February, 1886, and before the next session of said circuit court, and before the time when by law the petitioner was bound to present or file the record of said suit in said circuit court, a motion was made by the plaintiffs in said suit in said circuit court to remand the said suit to the said city court.  This motion came on before the Honorable William J. Wallace, the Circuit Judge, on the notice of motion of said plaintiffs, wherein they moved upon an affidavit of Treadwell Cleveland, and upon \'all the papers and proceedings theretofore had in said action,\' which included said complaint."</p>\n<p>"The counsel for said plaintiffs moved said motion in the absence from the court of your petitioner and of anyone representing him, but petitioner was shortly afterwards allowed to be heard by said circuit judge, who thereupon, by an order entered that day, remanded said cause.  Your petitioner supposed that the circuit judge had before him or in the record filed upon said motion a copy of the complaint and that such observations as he made were based upon knowledge of the same.  Your petitioner therefore deferred to the views expressed by the circuit judge and did not call his attention in detail to said complaint, but submitted with deference to his ruling in the full belief that it was upon such knowledge of the complaint as would fully possess him of the basis of petitioner\'s argument."</p>\n<p>"In fact, no copy of said complaint was ever seen by Judge Wallace or filed upon said motion, and the information of it which he had was derived from the affidavit of Cleveland and such statements as may have been made by plaintiffs\' counsel in petitioner\'s absence."</p>\n<p>"Your petitioner first learned of this state of the record upon </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 124 U.

Your petitioner was not party to and did not know of this mistake until after the receipt of the warrant and before any demand was made upon him on behalf of plaintiffs.  Your petitioner presented a claim for plaintiffs based upon a construction of the act of 1874, upon the actual facts, and the award was made as above stated.  The mistake arose by the confounding by a Treasury clerk in the bookkeeping in the Department the seizure case with the <em>in personam</em> case.  The Secretary has therefore not in fact made any such award as that relied on by plaintiffs. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 124 U.
