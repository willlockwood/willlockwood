In weighing the high likelihood of serious injury or death to respondent that Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions posed against the actual and imminent threat that respondent posed to the lives of others, the Court takes account of the number of lives at risk and the relative culpability of the parties involved.  Respondent intentionally placed himself and the public in danger by unlawfully engaging in reckless, high-speed flight; those who might have been harmed had Scott not forced respondent off the road were entirely innocent.  The Court concludes that it was reasonable for Scott to take the action he did.  It rejects respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that safety could have been assured if the police simply ceased their pursuit.  The Court rules that a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.

Put another way: Can an officer take actions that place a fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death in order to stop the motorist\xe2\x80\x99s flight from endangering the lives of innocent bystanders?</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2001, a Georgia county deputy clocked respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle traveling at 73 miles per hour on a road with a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit.  The deputy activated his blue flashing lights indicating that respondent should pull over.  Instead, respondent sped away, initiating a chase down what is in most portions a two-lane road, at speeds exceeding 85 miles per hour.  The deputy radioed his dispatch to report that he was pursuing a fleeing vehicle, and broadcast its license plate number.  Petitioner, Deputy Timothy Scott, heard the radio communication and joined the pursuit along with other officers.  In the midst of the chase, respondent pulled into the parking lot of a shopping center and was nearly boxed in by the various police vehicles.  Respondent evaded the trap by making a sharp turn, colliding with Scott\xe2\x80\x99s police car, exiting the parking lot, and speeding off once again down a two-lane highway.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following respondent\xe2\x80\x99s shopping center maneuvering, which resulted in slight damage to Scott\xe2\x80\x99s police car, Scott took over as the lead pursuit vehicle.  Six minutes and nearly 10 miles after the chase had begun, Scott decided to attempt to terminate the episode by employing a \xe2\x80\x9cPrecision Intervention Technique (\xe2\x80\x98PIT\xe2\x80\x99) maneuver, which causes the fleeing vehicle to spin to a stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 4.  Having radioed his supervisor for permission, Scott was told to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[g]o ahead and take him out.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Coweta County</em>, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 807, 811 (CA11 2005).  Instead, Scott applied his push bumper to the rear of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As a result, respondent lost control of his vehicle, which left the roadway, ran down an embankment, overturned, and crashed.  Respondent was badly injured and was rendered a quadriplegic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent filed suit against Deputy Scott and others under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, a violation of his federal constitutional rights, viz. use of excessive force resulting in an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  In response, Scott filed a motion for summary judgment based on an assertion of qualified immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are material issues of fact on which the issue of qualified immunity turns which present sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Coweta County</em>, No. 3:01\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93148\xe2\x80\x93WBH (ND Ga., Sept. 23, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a\xe2\x80\x9342a.  On interlocutory appeal,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment claim against Scott to proceed to trial.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Taking respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view of the facts as given, the Court of Appeals concluded that Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions could constitute \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly force\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a> (1985), and that the use of such force in this context \xe2\x80\x9cwould violate [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] constitutional right to be free from excessive force during a seizure.  Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that Scott violated [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] Fourth Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 816.  The Court of Appeals further concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe law as it existed [at the time of the incident], was sufficiently clear to give reasonable law enforcement officers \xe2\x80\x98fair notice\xe2\x80\x99 that ramming a vehicle under these circumstances was unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 817.  The Court of Appeals thus concluded that Scott was not entitled to qualified immunity.  We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. __ (2006), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In resolving questions of qualified immunity, courts are required to resolve a \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a constitutional right?  This must be the initial inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 201 (2001).  If, and only if, the court finds a violation of a constitutional right, \xe2\x80\x9cthe next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established \xe2\x80\xa6 in light of the specific context of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although this ordering contradicts \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur policy of avoiding unnecessary adjudication of constitutional issues,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U.

S. 288</a>, 346\xe2\x80\x93347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)), we have said that such a departure from practice is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a [future] holding that a right is clearly established.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 201.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We therefore turn to the threshold inquiry: whether Deputy Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first step in assessing the constitutionality of Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions is to determine the relevant facts.  As this case was decided on summary judgment, there have not yet been factual findings by a judge or jury, and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s version of events (unsurprisingly) differs substantially from Scott\xe2\x80\x99s version.  When things are in such a posture, courts are required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences \xe2\x80\x9cin the light most favorable to the party opposing the [summary judgment] motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Diebold, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/654/index.html">369 U. S. 654</a>, 655 (1962) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Saucier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 201.  In qualified immunity cases, this usually means adopting (as the Court of Appeals did here) the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s version of the facts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, an added wrinkle in this case: existence in the record of a videotape capturing the events in question.  There are no allegations or indications that this videotape was doctored or altered in any way, nor any contention that what it depicts differs from what actually happened.  The videotape quite clearly contradicts the version of the story told by respondent and adopted by the Court of Appeals.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  For example, the Court of Appeals adopted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that, during the chase, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was little, if any, actual threat to pedestrians or other motorists, as the roads were mostly empty and [respondent] remained in control of his vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 815.  Indeed, reading the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, one gets the impression that respondent, rather than fleeing from police, was attempting to pass his driving test:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]aking the facts from the non-movant\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint, [respondent] remained in control of his vehicle, slowed for turns and intersections, and typically used his indicators for turns.  He did not run any motorists off the road.  Nor was he a threat to pedestrians in the shopping center parking lot, which was free from pedestrian and vehicular traffic as the center was closed.  Significantly, by the time the parties were back on the highway and Scott rammed [respondent], the motorway had been cleared of motorists and pedestrians allegedly because of police blockades of the nearby intersections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 815\xe2\x80\x93816 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The videotape tells quite a different story.  There we see respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle racing down narrow, two-lane roads in the dead of night at speeds that are shockingly fast.  We see it swerve around more than a dozen other cars, cross the double-yellow line, and force cars traveling in both directions to their respective shoulders to avoid being hit.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We see it run multiple red lights and travel for considerable periods of time in the occasional center left-turn-only lane, chased by numerous police cars forced to engage in the same hazardous maneuvers just to keep up.  Far from being the cautious and controlled driver the lower court depicts, what we see on the video more closely resembles a Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening sort, placing police officers and innocent bystanders alike at great risk of serious injury.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the summary judgment stage, facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine\xe2\x80\x9d dispute as to those facts.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).  As we have emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no \xe2\x80\x98genuine issue for trial.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/574/index.html">475 U. S. 574</a>, 586\xe2\x80\x93587 (1986) (footnote omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mere existence of <em>some </em>alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine</em> issue of <em>material</em> fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/242/index.html">477 U. S. 242</a>, 247\xe2\x80\x93248 (1986).  When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was the case here with regard to the factual issue whether respondent was driving in such fashion as to endanger human life.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s version of events is so utterly discredited by the record that no reasonable jury could have believed him.  The Court of Appeals should not have relied on such visible fiction; it should have viewed the facts in the light depicted by the videotape.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judging the matter on that basis, we think it is quite clear that Deputy Scott did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Scott does not contest that his decision to terminate the car chase by ramming his bumper into respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cseizure.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] Fourth Amendment seizure [occurs] \xe2\x80\xa6 when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brower</em> v. <em>County of Inyo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/593/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/593/index.html">489 U.

It is also conceded, by both sides, that a claim of \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive force in the course of making [a] \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x98seizure\xe2\x80\x99 of [the] person \xe2\x80\xa6 [is] properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98objective reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99 standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U.

If so, respondent claims that <em>Garner</em> prescribes certain preconditions that must be met before Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions can survive Fourth Amendment scrutiny: (1) The suspect must have posed an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others; (2) deadly force must have been necessary to prevent escape;[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and (3) where feasible, the officer must have given the suspect some warning.  See Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing <em>Garner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312).  Since these <em>Garner </em>preconditions for using deadly force were not met in this case, Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions were <em>per se</em> unreasonable.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument falters at its first step; <em>Garner </em>did not establish a magical on/off switch that triggers rigid preconditions whenever an officer\xe2\x80\x99s actions constitute \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Garner</em> was simply an application of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d test, <em>Graham</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 388, to the use of a particular type of force in a particular situation.  <em>Garner</em> held that it was unreasonable to kill a \xe2\x80\x9cyoung, slight, and unarmed\xe2\x80\x9d burglary suspect, 471 U.

Whatever <em>Garner</em> said about the factors that <em>might have </em>justified shooting the suspect in that case, such \xe2\x80\x9cpreconditions\xe2\x80\x9d have scant applicability to this case, which has vastly different facts.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Garner</em> had nothing to do with one car striking another or even with car chases in general\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  A police car\xe2\x80\x99s bumping a fleeing car is, in fact, not much like a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s shooting a gun so as to hit a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adams</em> v. <em>St. Lucie County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Dept.</em>, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 1563, 1577 (CA11 1992) (Edmondson, J., dissenting), adopted by 998 F.\xc2\xa02d 923 (CA11 1993) (en banc) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Nor is the threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect even remotely comparable to the extreme danger to human life posed by respondent in this case.  Although respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to craft an easy-to-apply legal test in the Fourth Amendment context is admirable, in the end we must still slosh our way through the factbound morass of \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether or not Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions constituted application of \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly force,\xe2\x80\x9d all that matters is whether Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions were reasonable.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining the reasonableness of the manner in which a seizure is effected, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Place</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/696/index.html">462 U. S. 696</a>, 703 (1983).  Scott defends his actions by pointing to the paramount governmental interest in ensuring public safety, and respondent nowhere suggests this was not the purpose motivating Scott\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.  Thus, in judging whether Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions were reasonable, we must consider the risk of bodily harm that Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions posed to respondent in light of the threat to the public that Scott was trying to eliminate.  Although there is no obvious way to quantify the risks on either side, it is clear from the videotape that respondent posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the chase.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>.  It is equally clear that Scott\xe2\x80\x99s actions posed a high likelihood of serious injury or death to respondent\xe2\x80\x94though not the near <em>certainty</em> of death posed by, say, shooting a fleeing felon in the back of the head, see <em>Garner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 4, or pulling alongside a fleeing motorist\xe2\x80\x99s car and shooting the motorist, cf. <em>Vaughan</em> v. <em>Cox</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 1323, 1326\xe2\x80\x931327 (CA11 2003).  So how does a court go about weighing the perhaps lesser probability of injuring or killing numerous bystanders against the perhaps larger probability of injuring or killing a single person?  We think it appropriate in this process to take into account not only the number of lives at risk, but also their relative culpability.  It was respondent, after all, who intentionally placed himself and the public in danger by unlawfully engaging in the reckless, high-speed flight that ultimately produced the choice between two evils that Scott confronted.  Multiple police cars, with blue lights flashing and sirens blaring, had been chasing respondent for nearly 10 miles, but he ignored their warning to stop.  By contrast, those who might have been harmed had Scott not taken the action he did were entirely innocent.  We have little difficulty in concluding it was reasonable for Scott to take the action that he did.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But wait, says respondent: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the innocent public equally have been protected, and the tragic accident entirely avoided, if the police had simply ceased their pursuit?  We think the police need not have taken that chance and hoped for the best.  Whereas Scott\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x94ramming respondent off the road\xe2\x80\x94was <em>certain</em> to eliminate the risk that respondent posed to the public, ceasing pursuit was not.  First of all, there would have been no way to convey convincingly to respondent that the chase was off, and that he was free to go.  Had respondent looked in his rear-view mirror and seen the police cars deactivate their flashing lights and turn around, he would have had no idea whether they were truly letting him get away, or simply devising a new strategy for capture.  Perhaps the police knew a shortcut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and would reappear down the road to intercept him; or perhaps they were setting up a roadblock in his path.  Cf. <em>Brower</em>, 489 U. S., at 594.  Given such uncertainty, respondent might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we are loath to lay down a rule requiring the police to allow fleeing suspects to get away whenever they drive <em>so recklessly</em> that they put other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives in danger.  It is obvious the perverse incentives such a rule would create: Every fleeing motorist would know that escape is within his grasp, if only he accelerates to 90 miles per hour, crosses the double-yellow line a few times, and runs a few red lights.  The Constitution assuredly does not impose this invitation to impunity-earned-by-recklessness.  Instead, we lay down a more sensible rule: A police officer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The car chase that respondent initiated in this case posed a substantial and immediate risk of serious physical injury to others; no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.

There has been doubt expressed regarding the wisdom of <em>Saucier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make the threshold inquiry mandatory, especially in cases where the constitutional question is relatively difficult and the qualified immunity question relatively straightforward.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Brosseau</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 201 (Breyer, J., joined by Scalia and Ginsburg, JJ., concurring); <em>Bunting</em> v. <em>Mellen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1019/index.html">541 U.

We need not address the wisdom of <em>Saucier</em> in this case, however, because the constitutional question with which we are presented is, as discussed in Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>, easily decided.

It is not our experience that ambulances and fire engines careen down two-lane roads at 85-plus miles per hour, with an unmarked scout car out in front of them.  The risk they pose to the public is vastly less than what respondent created here.  But even if that were not so, it would in no way lead to the conclusion that it was unreasonable to eliminate the threat to life that respondent posed.

The necessity described in <em>Garner</em> was, in fact, the need to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cserious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  By way of example only, <em>Garner</em> hypothesized that deadly force may be used \xe2\x80\x9cif necessary to prevent escape\xe2\x80\x9d when the suspect is known to have \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, so that his mere being at large poses an inherent danger to society.  Respondent did not pose that type of inherent threat to society, since (prior to the car chase) he had committed only a minor traffic offense and, as far as the police were aware, had no prior criminal record.  But in this case, unlike in <em>Garner</em>, it was respondent\xe2\x80\x99s flight itself (by means of a speeding automobile) that posed the threat of \xe2\x80\x9cserious physical harm \xe2\x80\xa6 to others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals cites <em>Brower</em> v. <em>County of Inyo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/593/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/593/index.html">489 U.

The inquiry described by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313, is situation specific.

Because watching the video footage of the car chase made a difference to my own view of the case, I suggest that the interested reader take advantage of the link in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa05, and watch it.  Having done so, I do not believe a reasonable jury could, in this instance, find that Officer Timothy Scott (who joined the chase late in the day and did not know the specific reason why the respondent was being pursued) acted in violation of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the video makes clear the highly fact-dependent nature of this constitutional determination.  And that fact-dependency supports the argument that we should overrule the requirement, announced in <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a> (2001), that lower courts must first decide the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional question\xe2\x80\x9d before they turn to the \xe2\x80\x9cqualified immunity question.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 200 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, lower courts should be free to decide the two questions in whatever order makes sense in the context of a particular case.

Sometimes (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant loses the constitutional question but wins on qualified immunity) that order-of-battle rule may immunize an incorrect constitutional ruling from review.  Sometimes, as here, the order-of-battle rule will spawn constitutional rulings in areas of law so fact dependent that the result will be confusion rather than clarity.  And frequently the order-of-battle rule violates that older, wiser judicial counsel \xe2\x80\x9cnot to pass on questions of constitutionality \xe2\x80\xa6 unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>McLaughlin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/101/index.html">323 U.

The majority states: \xe2\x80\x9cA police officer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  This statement is too absolute.  As Justice Ginsburg points out, <em>ante</em>, at 1, whether a high-speed chase violates the Fourth Amendment may well depend upon more circumstances than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule reflects.  With these qualifications, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962396">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSCOTT V.

Depending on the circumstances, the answer may be an obvious \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d an obvious \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d or sufficiently doubtful that the question of the reasonableness of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s actions should be decided by a jury, after a review of the degree of danger and the alternatives available to the officer.  A high speed chase in a desert in Nevada is, after all, quite different from one that travels through the heart of Las Vegas. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on a <em>de novo</em> review of a videotape of a portion of a nighttime chase on a lightly traveled road in Georgia where no pedestrians or other \xe2\x80\x9cbystanders\xe2\x80\x9d were present, buttressed by uninformed speculation about the possible consequences of discontinuing the chase, eight of the jurors on this Court reach a verdict that differs from the views of the judges on both the District Court and the Court of Appeals who are surely more familiar with the hazards of driving on Georgia roads than we are.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s justification for this unprecedented departure from our well-settled standard of review of factual determinations made by a district court and affirmed by a court of appeals is based on its mistaken view that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 description of the facts was \xe2\x80\x9cblatantly contradicted by the record\xe2\x80\x9d and that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s version of the events was \xe2\x80\x9cso utterly discredited by the record that no reasonable jury could have believed him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than supporting the conclusion that what we see on the video \xe2\x80\x9cresembles a Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening sort,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the tape actually confirms, rather than contradicts, the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 appraisal of the factual questions at issue.  More important, it surely does not provide a principled basis for depriving the respondent of his right to have a jury evaluate the question whether the police officers\xe2\x80\x99 decision to use deadly force to bring the chase to an end was reasonable. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Omitted from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the initial speeding violation is the fact that respondent was on a four-lane portion of Highway 34 when the officer clocked his speed at 73 miles per hour and initiated the chase.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  More significant\xe2\x80\x94and contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cforce[d] cars traveling in both directions to their respective shoulders to avoid being hit\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x94a fact unmentioned in the text of the opinion explains why those cars pulled over prior to being passed by respondent.  The sirens and flashing lights on the police cars following respondent gave the same warning that a speeding ambulance or fire engine would have provided.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The 13 cars that respondent passed on his side of the road before entering the shopping center, and both of the cars that he passed on the right after leaving the center, no doubt had already pulled to the side of the road or were driving along the shoulder because they heard the police sirens or saw the flashing lights before respondent or the police cruisers approached.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  A jury could certainly conclude that those motorists were exposed to no greater risk than persons who take the same action in response to a speeding ambulance, and that their reactions were fully consistent with the evidence that respondent, though speeding, retained full control of his vehicle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The police sirens also minimized any risk that may have arisen from running \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple red lights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  In fact, respondent and his pursuers went through only two intersections with stop lights and in both cases all other vehicles in sight were stationary, presumably because they had been warned of the approaching speeders.  Incidentally, the videos do show that the lights were red when the police cars passed through them but, because the cameras were farther away when respondent did so and it is difficult to discern the color of the signal at that point, it is not entirely clear that he ran either or both of the red lights.  In any event, the risk of harm to the stationary vehicles was minimized by the sirens, and there is no reason to believe that respondent would have disobeyed the signals if he were not being pursued.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My colleagues on the jury saw respondent \xe2\x80\x9cswerve around more than a dozen other cars,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cforce cars traveling in both directions to their respective shoulders,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, but they apparently discounted the possibility that those cars were already out of the pursuit\xe2\x80\x99s path as a result of hearing the sirens.  Even if that were not so, passing a slower vehicle on a two-lane road always involves some degree of swerving and is not especially dangerous if there are no cars coming from the opposite direction.  At no point during the chase did respondent pull into the opposite lane other than to pass a car in front of him; he did the latter no more than five times and, on most of those occasions, used his turn signal.  On none of these occasions was there a car traveling in the opposite direction.  In fact, at one point, when respondent found himself behind a car in his own lane and there were cars traveling in the other direction, he slowed and waited for the cars traveling in the other direction to pass before overtaking the car in front of him while using his turn signal to do so.  This is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.  To the contrary, the video does not reveal any incidents that could even be remotely characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cclose calls.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the factual statements by the Court of Appeals quoted by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, were entirely accurate.  That court did not describe respondent as a \xe2\x80\x9ccautious\xe2\x80\x9d driver as my colleagues imply, <em>ante</em>, at 7, but it did correctly conclude that there is no evidence that he ever lost control of his vehicle.  That court also correctly pointed out that the incident in the shopping center parking lot did not create any risk to pedestrians or other vehicles because the chase occurred just before 11 p.m. on a weekday night and the center was closed.  It is apparent from the record (including the videotape) that local police had blocked off intersections to keep respondent from entering residential neighborhoods and possibly endangering other motorists.  I would add that the videos also show that no pedestrians, parked cars, sidewalks, or residences were visible at any time during the chase.  The only \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent bystanders\xe2\x80\x9d who were placed \xe2\x80\x9cat great risk of serious injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, were the drivers who either pulled off the road in response to the sirens or passed respondent in the opposite direction when he was driving on his side of the road.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize, of course, that even though respondent\xe2\x80\x99s original speeding violation on a four-lane highway was rather ordinary, his refusal to stop and subsequent flight was a serious offense that merited severe punishment.  It was not, however, a capital offense, or even an offense that justified the use of deadly force rather than an abandonment of the chase.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern about the \xe2\x80\x9cimminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 11, while surely valid in an appropriate case, should be discounted in a case involving a nighttime chase in an area where no pedestrians were present.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What would have happened if the police had decided to abandon the chase?  We now know that they could have apprehended respondent later because they had his license plate number.  Even if that were not true, and even if he would have escaped any punishment at all, the use of deadly force in this case was no more appropriate than the use of a deadly weapon against a fleeing felon in <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a> (1985).  In any event, any uncertainty about the result of abandoning the pursuit has not prevented the Court from basing its conclusions on its own factual assumptions.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court attempts to avoid the conclusion that deadly force was unnecessary by speculating that if the officers had let him go, respondent might have been \xe2\x80\x9cjust as likely\xe2\x80\x9d to continue to drive recklessly as to slow down and wipe his brow.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  That speculation is unconvincing as a matter of common sense and improper as a matter of law.  Our duty to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party would foreclose such speculation if the Court had not used its observation of the video as an excuse for replacing the rule of law with its ad hoc judgment.  There is no evidentiary basis for an assumption that dangers caused by flight from a police pursuit will continue after the pursuit ends.  Indeed, rules adopted by countless police departments throughout the country are based on a judgment that differs from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. to Brief for Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> A\xe2\x80\x9352 (\xe2\x80\x9cDuring a pursuit, the need to apprehend the suspect should always outweigh the level of danger created by the pursuit.  When the immediate danger to the public created by the pursuit is greater than the immediate or potential danger to the public should the suspect remain at large, then the pursuit should be discontinued or terminated\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [P]ursuits should usually be discontinued when the violator\xe2\x80\x99s identity has been established to the point that later apprehension can be accomplished without danger to the public\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Garner</em> may not, as the Court suggests, \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a magical on/off switch that triggers rigid preconditions\xe2\x80\x9d for the use of deadly force, <em>ante</em>, at 9, it did set a threshold under which the use of deadly force would be considered constitutionally unreasonable:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.  Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if, where feasible, some warning has been given.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U. S., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p align="left">\nWhether a person\xe2\x80\x99s actions have risen to a level warranting deadly force is a question of fact best reserved for a jury.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Here, the Court has usurped the jury\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding function and, in doing so, implicitly labeled the four other judges to review the case unreasonable.  It chastises the Court of Appeals for failing to \xe2\x80\x9cvie[w] the facts in the light depicted by the videotape\xe2\x80\x9d and implies that no reasonable person could view the videotape and come to the conclusion that deadly force was unjustified.  <em>Ant</em>e, at 8.  However, the three judges on the Court of Appeals panel apparently did view the videotapes entered into evidence[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and described a very different version of events:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time of the ramming, apart from speeding and running two red lights, Harris was driving in a non-aggressive fashion (i.e., without trying to ram or run into the officers).  Moreover, \xe2\x80\xa6 Scott\xe2\x80\x99s path on the open highway was largely clear.  The videos introduced into evidence show little to no vehicular (or pedestrian) traffic, allegedly because of the late hour and the police blockade of the nearby intersections.  Finally, Scott issued absolutely no warning (e.g., over the loudspeaker or otherwise) prior to using deadly force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Coweta County</em>, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 807, 819, n.\xc2\xa014 (CA11 2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf two groups of judges can disagree so vehemently about the nature of the pursuit and the circumstances surrounding that pursuit, it seems eminently likely that a reasonable juror could disagree with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of events.  Moreover, under the standard set forth in <em>Garner</em>, it is certainly possible that \xe2\x80\x9ca jury could conclude that Scott unreasonably used deadly force to seize Harris by ramming him off the road under the instant circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 821.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today sets forth a <em>per se</em> rule that presumes its own version of the facts: \xe2\x80\x9cA police officer\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase <em>that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders</em> does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (emphasis added).  Not only does that rule fly in the face of the flexible and case-by-case \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d approach applied in <em>Garner</em> and<em> Graham</em> v. <em>Connor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U. S. 386</a> (1989), but it is also arguably inapplicable to the case at hand, given that it is not clear that this chase threatened the life of any \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent bystande[r].\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In my view, the risks inherent in justifying unwarranted police conduct on the basis of unfounded assumptions are unacceptable, particularly when less drastic measures\xe2\x80\x94in this case, the use of stop sticks[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] or a simple warning issued from a loudspeaker\xe2\x80\x94could have avoided such a tragic result.  In my judgment, jurors in Georgia should be allowed to evaluate the reasonableness of the decision to ram respondent\xe2\x80\x99s speeding vehicle in a manner that created an obvious risk of death and has in fact made him a quadriplegic at the age of 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I can only conclude that my colleagues were unduly frightened by two or three images on the tape that looked like bursts of lightning or explosions, but were in fact merely the headlights of vehicles zooming by in the opposite lane.  Had they learned to drive when most high-speed driving took place on two-lane roads rather than on superhighways\xe2\x80\x94when split-second judgments about the risk of passing a slow-poke in the face of oncoming traffic were routine\xe2\x80\x94they might well have reacted to the videotape more dispassionately.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0According to the District Court record, when respondent was clocked at 73 miles per hour, the deputy who recorded his speed was sitting in his patrol car on Highway 34 between Lora Smith Road and Sullivan Road in Coweta County, Georgia.  At that point, as well as at the point at which Highway 34 intersects with Highway 154\xe2\x80\x94where the deputy caught up with respondent and the videotape begins\xe2\x80\x94Highway 34 is a four-lane road, consisting of two lanes in each direction with a wide grass divider separating the flow of traffic.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0While still on the four-lane portion of Highway 34, the deputy who had clocked respondent\xe2\x80\x99s speed turned on his blue light and siren in an attempt to get respondent to pull over.  It was when the deputy turned on his blue light that the dash-mounted video camera was activated and began to record the pursuit.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although perhaps understandable, because their volume on the sound recording is low (possibly due to sound proofing in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle), the Court appears to minimize the significance of the sirens audible throughout the tape recording of the pursuit. </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In noting that Scott\xe2\x80\x99s action \xe2\x80\x9cwas <em>certain</em> to eliminate the risk that respondent posed to the public\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cceasing pursuit was not,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court prioritizes total elimination of the risk of harm to the public over the risk that respondent may be seriously injured or even killed.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (emphasis in original).  The Court is only able to make such a statement by assuming, based on its interpretation of events on the videotape, that the risk of harm posed in this case, and the type of harm involved, rose to a level warranting deadly force.  These are the same types of questions that, when disputed, are typically resolved by a jury; this is why both the District Court and the Court of Appeals saw fit to have them be so decided.  Although the Court claims only to have drawn factual inferences in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s favor \xe2\x80\x9c<em>to the extent supportable by the record</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa08 (emphasis in original), its own view of the record has clearly precluded it from doing so to the same extent as the two courts through which this case has already traveled, see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In its opinion, the Court of Appeals correctly noted: \xe2\x80\x9cWe reject the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 argument that Harris\xe2\x80\x99 driving must, as a matter of law, be considered sufficiently reckless to give Scott probable cause to believe that he posed a substantial threat of imminent physical harm to motorists and pedestrians.  This is a disputed issue to be resolved by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Coweta County</em>, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 807, 815 (CA11 2005).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In total, there are four police tapes which captured portions of the pursuit, all recorded from different officers\xe2\x80\x99 vehicles.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is unclear whether, in referring to \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent bystanders,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court is referring to the motorists driving unfazed in the opposite direction or to the drivers who pulled over to the side of the road, safely out of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s path.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStop sticks\xe2\x80\x9d are a device which can be placed across the roadway and used to flatten a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s tires slowly to safely terminate a pursuit.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
