Agent Doyle overheard respondent Howards, who was speaking into his cell phone, state that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he\xe2\x80\x99s killed today.\xe2\x80\x9d  Doyle and other agents observed Howards enter the line to meet the Vice President, tell the Vice President that his \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies in Iraq are disgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d and touch the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder as the Vice President was leaving.  After being briefed by Doyle, Agent Reichle interviewed and then arrested Howards, who was charged with harassment.  After that charge was dismissed, Howards brought an action against petitioners and others under \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, \n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388\n.  Howards claimed that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in violation of the \n \nFourth Amendment, and that the arrest violated the \n \nFirst Amendment because it was made in retaliation for Howards\xe2\x80\x99 criticism of the Vice President.  Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the Federal District Court denied the motion.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the \n \nFourth Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards, but the court affirmed with regard to the \n \nFirst Amendment claim.  In doing so, the court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that, under Hartman v. Moore, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, probable cause to arrest defeats a \n \nFirst Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.  It concluded instead that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory arrest violates the \n \nFirst Amendment even if supported by probable cause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because, at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a \n \nFirst Amendment violation.

Although Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s facts involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reasonable law enforcement officers could have questioned whether its rule also applied to arrests.  First, Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly.  It resolved a Circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory prosecution claims, but some of the conflicting cases involved both retaliatory prosecution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no distinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable cause.  Second, a reasonable official could have interpreted Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests.  Like in retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually all retaliatory arrest cases, and the causal link between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury may be tenuous.  Finally, decisions from other Circuits in the wake of Hartman support the conclusion that, for qualified immunity purposes, it was at least arguable at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest that Hartman extended to retaliatory arrests.

The agents determined that Agent Reichle, who coordinated the protective intelligence team respon- sible for interviewing individuals suspected of violat- ing the law, should question Howards.  Agent Reichle had not personally heard Howards\xe2\x80\x99 comments or seen his con- tact with the Vice President, but Agent Doyle briefed Agent Reichle on what had happened.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgent Reichle approached Howards, presented his badge and identified himself, and asked to speak with him.  Howards refused and attempted to walk away.  At that point, Agent Reichle stepped in front of Howards and asked if he had assaulted the Vice President.  Pointing his finger at Agent Reichle, Howards denied assaulting the Vice President and told Agent Reichle, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t want other people sharing their opinions, you should have him [the Vice President] avoid public places.\xe2\x80\x9d  Howards v.

The court concluded that petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards for making a materially false statement to a federal official in violation of \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 because he falsely denied touching the Vice President.  634 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1142.

Id., at 1144\xe2\x80\x931145.  The court then rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Hartman v. Moore, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250 (2006)\n, probable cause to arrest defeats a \n \nFirst Amendment claim of retaliatory arrest.  The court concluded that Hartman established such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution claims and, therefore, did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest violates the \n \nFirst Amendment even if supported by probable cause.  634 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJudge Paul Kelly dissented from the court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of qualified immunity.  He would have held that when Howards was arrested, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the \n \nFirst Amendment.

He noted that other Circuits had applied Hartman to retaliatory arrests and that there was a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong argument\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of doing so.  634 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1151\xe2\x80\x931152.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari on two questions: whether a \n \nFirst Amendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the presence of probable cause to support the arrest, and whether clearly established law at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest so held.

We conclude that, at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the \n \nFirst Amendment.

Bevers, 922 F.\xc2\xa02d 618 (1990), and Poole v. County of Otero, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 955 (2001), the Court of Appeals concluded that, at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, its precedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an arrest in retaliation for the exercise of \n \nFirst Amendment rights, irrespective of probable cause.  In DeLoach, a case involving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prosecution, the court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n act taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under \xc2\xa71983 even if the act, when taken for a different reason, would have been proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  922 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 620 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In Poole, a sub- sequent retaliatory prosecution case, the court relied on DeLoach for the proposition that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s illegal conduct is \xe2\x80\x9cnot relevant to his \n \nFirst Amendment claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  271 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 961.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals acknowledged that Poole was abrogated by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent decision in Hartman v. Moore, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, which held that a plaintiff cannot state a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the \n \nFirst Amendment if the charges were supported by probable cause.  But the Court of Appeals determined that Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s no-probable-cause requirement did not extend to claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb its prior precedent in DeLoach.  Accordingly, the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Mr. Howards was arrested it was clearly established that an arrest made in retaliation of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFirst Amendment rights is unlawful, even if the arrest is supported by probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  634 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1148.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe disagree.  At the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s precedent governing retal- iatory arrests was far from clear.  Although the facts of Hartman involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reason- able officers could have questioned whether the rule of Hartman also applied to arrests.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly.  Hartman resolved a split among the Courts of Appeals about the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits, but some of the conflicting court of appeals cases involved both an arrest and a prosecution that were alleged to be retaliation for the exercise of \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255\xe2\x80\x93256, 259, n.\xc2\xa06 (citing Mozzochi v. Borden, 959 F.\xc2\xa02d 1174 (CA2 1992); Singer v. Fulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F.\xc2\xa03d 110 (CA2 1995); Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.\xc2\xa03d 252 (CA5 2002); Wood v. Kesler, 323 F.\xc2\xa03d 872 (CA11 2003)).  Those cases made no distinction between claims of retaliatory arrest and claims of retaliatory prosecution when considering the relevance of prob- able cause.  See Mozzochi, supra, at 1179\xe2\x80\x931180; Singer, supra, at 120; Keenan, supra, at 260; Wood, supra, at 883.  Indeed, the close relationship between retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s own decision in DeLoach.  DeLoach, too, involved allegations of both retaliatory arrest and retaliatory prosecution, and the Tenth Circuit analyzed the two claims as one.  922 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 620\xe2\x80\x93621.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA reasonable official also could have interpreted Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests.  Hartman first observed that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the charges would always be \xe2\x80\x9cavailable and apt to prove or disprove retaliatory causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 261.  In this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the presence of probable cause, while not a \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee\xe2\x80\x9d that retaliatory motive did not cause the prosecution, still precluded any prima facie inference that retaliatory motive was the but-for cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  Id., at 265.  This was especially true because, as Hartman next emphasized, retaliatory prosecution claims involve particularly attenuated causation between the de- fendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  Id., at 259\xe2\x80\x93261.  In a retaliatory prosecution case, the key defendant is typically not the prosecutor who made the charging decision that injured the plaintiff, because prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for their decisions to prosecute.  Rather, the key defendant is the person who allegedly prompted the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Thus, the intervening decision of the third-party prosecutor widens the causal gap between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s animus and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  Id., at 261\xe2\x80\x93263.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually every retaliatory arrest case.  Such evidence could be thought similarly fatal to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim that animus caused his arrest, given that retaliatory arrest cases also present a tenuous causal connection between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged animus and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  An officer might bear animus toward the content of a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  But the officer may decide to arrest the suspect because his speech provides evidence of a crime or suggests a potential threat.  See, e.g., Wayte v. United States, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\n\xe2\x80\x93613 (1985) (noting that letters of protest written to the Selective Service, in which the author expressed disagreement with the draft, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided strong, perhaps conclusive evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of the nonregistrant\xe2\x80\x99s intent not to comply\xe2\x80\x94one of the elements of the offense\xe2\x80\x9d of willful failure to register for the draft).  Like retaliatory prosecution cases, then, the connection between alleged animus and injury may be weakened in the arrest context by a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s wholly legitimate consideration of speech.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, we do not suggest that Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rule in fact extends to arrests.  Nor do we suggest that every as- pect of Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rationale could apply to retaliatory arrests.  Hartman concluded that the causal connection in retaliatory prosecution cases is attenuated because those cases necessarily involve the animus of one person and the injurious action of another, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262, but in many retaliatory arrest cases, it is the officer bearing the al- leged animus who makes the injurious arrest.  Moreover, Hartman noted that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, the causal connection between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s animus and the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision is further weakened by the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial decisionmaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 263.  That presumption does not apply here.  Nonetheless, the fact remains that, for qualified immunity purposes, at the time of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest it was at least arguable that Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rule extended to retaliatory arrests.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDecisions from other Federal Courts of Appeals in the wake of Hartman support this assessment.  Shortly before Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, the Sixth Circuit held that Hartman required a plaintiff alleging a retaliatory arrest to show that the defendant officer lacked probable cause.  See Barnes v. Wright, 449 F.\xc2\xa03d 709, 720 (2006) (reasoning that the Hartman \xe2\x80\x9crule sweeps broadly\xe2\x80\x9d).  That court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Hartman confirms that the inapplicability of Hartman to arrests would not have been clear to a reasonable officer when Howards was arrested.  Moreover, since Howards\xe2\x80\x99 arrest, additional Courts of Appeals have concluded that Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s no-probable-cause requirement extends to retaliatory arrests.  See, e.g., McCabe v. Parker, 608 F.\xc2\xa03d 1068, 1075 (CA8 2010); Phillips v. Irvin, 222 Fed. Appx. 928, 929 (CA11 2007) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  As we have previously observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wilson v. Layne, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 603, \n618 (1999)\n.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHartman injected uncertainty into the law governing retaliatory arrests, particularly in light of Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s rationale and the close relationship between retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims.  This uncertainty was only confirmed by subsequent appellate decisions that disagreed over whether the reasoning in Hartman applied similarly to retaliatory arrests.  Accordingly, when Howards was arrested it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a \n \nFirst Amendment violation.

Moore, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250 (2006)\n, does not support their entitlement to qualified immunity.  Hartman involved a charge of retaliatory prosecution.  As the Court explains, the defendant in such a case cannot be the prosecutor who made the decision to pursue charges.  See ante, at 9; Hartman, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262 (noting that prosecutors are \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely immune from liability for the decision to prosecute\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, the defendant will be another government official who, motivated by retaliatory animus, convinced the prosecutor to act.  See ibid.; ante, at 9.  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9ccausal connection [a plaintiff must establish in a retaliatory-prosecution case] is not merely between the retaliatory animus of one person and that person\xe2\x80\x99s own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the action of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hartman, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262.  This \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct problem of causation\xe2\x80\x9d justified the absence-of-probable-cause requirement we recognized in Hartman.  Id., at 263 (Proof of an absence of probable cause to prosecute is needed \xe2\x80\x9cto bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent\xe2\x80\x99s motive and the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s action.\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also id., at 259 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he need to prove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with details specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA similar causation problem will not arise in the typi- cal retaliatory-arrest case.  Unlike prosecutors, arresting officers are not wholly immune from suit.  As a result, a plaintiff can sue the arresting officer directly and need only show that the officer (not some other official) acted with a retaliatory motive.  Because, in the usual retaliatory- arrest case, there is no gap to bridge between one gov- ernment official\xe2\x80\x99s animus and a second government official\xe2\x80\x99s action, Hartman\xe2\x80\x99s no-probable-cause requirement is inapplicable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Officers assigned to protect public officials must make singularly swift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the person they are guarding is in jeopardy.  In performing that protective function, they rightly take into account words spoken to, or in the proximity of, the person whose safety is their charge.  Whatever the views of Secret Service Agents Reichle and Doyle on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies in Iraq, they were duty bound to take the con- tent of Howards\xe2\x80\x99 statements into account in determining whether he posed an immediate threat to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s physical security.  Retaliatory animus cannot be inferred from the assessment they made in that regard.  If rational, that assessment should not expose them to claims for civil damages.
