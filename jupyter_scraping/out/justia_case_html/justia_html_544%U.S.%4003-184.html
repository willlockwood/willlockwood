S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77443A(a), (b), but ultimate decision, when tax deficiencies exceed $50,000, is reserved for the court itself, \xc2\xa77443A(b)(5), (c).  Tax Court Rule 183(b) governs the two-tiered proceedings in which a special trial judge hears the case, but the court renders the final decision.  Rule 183(b) directs that, after trial and submission of briefs, the special trial judge \xe2\x80\x9cshall submit a report, including findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, [who] will assign the case to a Judge \xe2\x80\xa6 of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  In acting on the report, the assigned Tax Court judge must give \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard \xe2\x80\xa6 to the circumstance that the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d must \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] to be correct\xe2\x80\x9d factfindings contained in the report, and \xe2\x80\x9cmay adopt the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge\xe2\x80\x99s report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 183(c).  Until 1983, such special trial judge reports were made public and included in the record on appeal.  Pursuant to a rule revision that year, those reports are now withheld from the public and excluded from the appellate record, and Tax Court judges do not disclose whether the final decision \xe2\x80\x9cmodi[fies]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creject[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report.  Instead, the final decision invariably begins with a stock statement that the Tax Court judge \xe2\x80\x9cagrees with and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether and how the final decision deviates from the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s original report is never revealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners Claude Ballard, Burton Kanter, and another taxpayer received notices of deficiency from respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) charging them with failure to report certain payments on their individual tax returns and with tax fraud.  They filed petitions for redetermination in the Tax Court, where the Chief Judge assigned the consolidated case to Special Trial Judge Couvillion.  After trial, Judge Couvillion submitted a Rule 183(b) report to the Chief Judge, who issued an order assigning the case to Tax Court Judge Dawson \xe2\x80\x9cfor review [of that report], and if approved, for adoption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ultimately, Judge Dawson issued the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, finding that the taxpayers had acted with intent to deceive the Commissioner, and holding them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penalties.  That decision, consisting wholly of a document labeled \xe2\x80\x9cOpinion of the Special Trial Judge,\xe2\x80\x9d declared: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on conversations between Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s attorney and two Tax Court judges, the taxpayers came to believe that the decision was <em>not</em> in fact a reproduction of Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report.  According to a declaration submitted by Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Judge Couvillion had concluded that the taxpayers did not owe taxes with respect to some of the payments at issue and that the fraud penalty was not applicable.  The taxpayers therefore filed motions seeking access to Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s initial report as submitted to the Chief Judge or, in the alternative, permission to place that report under seal in the appellate record.  Denying the requested relief, the Tax Court stated: \xe2\x80\x9cJudge Dawson \xe2\x80\xa6 and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agre[e] that \xe2\x80\xa6 Judge Dawson adopted the findings of fact and opinion of \xe2\x80\xa6 Judge Couvillion, \xe2\x80\xa6 presumed [those] findings of fact \xe2\x80\xa6 were correct, and \xe2\x80\xa6 gave due regard\xe2\x80\x9d to Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s credibility findings.  The order added that \xe2\x80\x9cany preliminary drafts\xe2\x80\x9d of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report were \xe2\x80\x9cnot subject to production because they relate to [the court\xe2\x80\x99s] internal deliberative processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  On appeal, both the Eleventh Circuit in Ballard\xe2\x80\x99s case and the Seventh Circuit in Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s case rejected the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 objection to the absence of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report from the appellate record.  Proceeding to the merits, both Courts of Appeals affirmed the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s final decision in principal part.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Tax Court may not exclude from the record on appeal Rule 183(b) reports submitted by special trial judges.  No statute authorizes, and Rule 183\xe2\x80\x99s current text does not warrant, the concealment at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Rule 183(c)\xe2\x80\x99s promulgation history confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that deference is due the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfindings under the \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct\xe2\x80\x9d formulations.  Under Rule 183\xe2\x80\x99s precursor, the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report was a transparent process.  The report was served on the parties, who were authorized to file objections to it, and the regular Tax Court judge reviewed the report independently, on the basis of the record and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 objections.  Parties were therefore equipped to argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings the required measure of respect.  On adoption of the 1983 amendments, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging instances in which it rejected or modified special trial judge findings.  Instead, it appears that the Tax Court inaugurated a novel practice whereby the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report is treated essentially as an in-house draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular Tax Court judge and the special trial judge.  The regular Tax Court judge then issues a decision purporting to \xe2\x80\x9cagre[e] with and adop[t] the opinion of the Special Trial Judge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nowhere in the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s current Rules is this joint enterprise described or authorized.  Notably, the Rules provide for only one special trial judge \xe2\x80\x9copinion\xe2\x80\x9d:\xc2\xa0Rule 183(b) instructs that the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report, submitted to the Chief Judge <em>before</em> a regular Tax Court judge is assigned to the case, shall consist of findings of fact and opinion.  It is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c), tellingly captioned \xe2\x80\x9cAction on the Report,\xe2\x80\x9d instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject.  It is difficult to comprehend how a Tax Court judge would give \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d to, and \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d an opinion he himself collaborated in producing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tax Court, like all other decisionmaking tribunals, is obliged to follow its own Rules.  See, <em>e.g., Service</em> v. <em>Dulles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/363/index.html">354 U. S. 363</a>, 388.  Although the Tax Court is not without leeway in interpreting its Rules, it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 an unprovided-for collaborative process, and to interpret the formulations \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d to convey something other than what those same words meant prior to the 1983 rule changes.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice of not disclosing the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s original report, and of obscuring the Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x99s mode of reviewing that report, impedes fully informed appellate review of the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  In directing the regular judge to give \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determinations and to \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 correct\xe2\x80\x9d the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfindings, Rule 183(c) recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The officer who hears witnesses and sifts through evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a paper record.  Fraud cases, in particular, may involve critical credibility assessments, rendering the appraisals of the judge who presided at trial vital to the ultimate determination.  In the present cases, for example, the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision repeatedly draws outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard, Kanter, and other witnesses.  Absent access to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report in this and similar cases, the appellate court will be at a loss to determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings made in that report were accorded \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and were \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed \xe2\x80\xa6 correct\xe2\x80\x9d by the Tax Court judge, or (2) whether they were displaced without adherence to those standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice is extraordinary, for it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose a hearing officer\xe2\x80\x99s initial report, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7636(b)(1)(C), and to make that report part of the record available to an appellate forum, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7557(c).  The Commissioner asserts a statutory analogy, however, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77460(b), which instructs that when the full Tax Court reviews the decision of a single Tax Court judge, the initial one-judge decision \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be part of the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court rejects the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s endeavor to equate proceedings that differ markedly.  Full Tax Court review is designed for resolution of legal issues.  Review of that order is <em>de novo.</em>  In contrast, findings of fact are key to special trial judge reports.  Those findings, under the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rules, are not subject to <em>de novo</em> review.  Instead, they are measured against \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed correct\xe2\x80\x9d standards.  Furthermore, all regular Tax Court members are equal in rank, each has an equal voice in the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s business, and the regular judge who issued the original decision is free to file a dissenting opinion recapitulating that judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial opinion.  The special trial judge, who serves at the pleasure of the Tax Court, lacks the regular judges\xe2\x80\x99 independence and the prerogative to publish dissenting views.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice is not described and authorized by that court\xe2\x80\x99s Rules, this Court need not reach, and expresses no opinion on, the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 further arguments based on due process and other statutory provisions.  Should the Tax Court some day amend its Rules to adopt the idiosyncratic procedure here rejected, the changed character of the Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x99s review of special trial judge reports would be subject to appellate review for consistency with the relevant federal statutes and due process.

See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77443A(a).  Unlike Tax Court judges, who are appointed by the President for 15-year terms, see \xc2\xa77443(b), (e), special trial judges have no fixed term of office, \xc2\xa77443A(a).  Any case before the Tax Court may be assigned to a special trial judge for hearing.  Ultimate decision in cases involving tax deficiencies that exceed $50,000, however, is reserved for the Tax Court.  \xc2\xa77443A(c).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tax Court Rule 183 governs the two-tiered proceedings in which a special trial judge hears the case, but the Tax Court itself renders the final decision.  The Rule directs that, after trial and submission of briefs, the special trial judge \xe2\x80\x9cshall submit a report, including findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, and the Chief Judge will assign the case to a Judge \xe2\x80\xa6 of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tax Ct. Rule 183(b), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 1619.  In acting on the report, the Tax Court judge to whom the case is assigned must give \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard \xe2\x80\xa6 to the circumstance that the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 183(c), <em>ibid.</em>  Further, fact findings contained in the report \xe2\x80\x9cshall be presumed to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The final Tax Court decision \xe2\x80\x9cmay adopt the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge\xe2\x80\x99s report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until 1983, special trial judge reports, as submitted to the Chief Judge, were made public and were included in the record on appeal.  A rule revision that year deleted the requirement that, upon submission of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report, \xe2\x80\x9ca copy \xe2\x80\xa6 shall forthwith be served on each party.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Rule 183 note, 81 T.\xc2\xa0C. 1069\xe2\x80\x931070 (1984).  Correspondingly, the revision deleted the prior provision giving parties an opportunity to set forth \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to the report.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Coincident with those rule changes, the Tax Court significantly altered its practice in cases referred for trial, but not final decision, to special trial judges.  Since the January 16, 1984 effective date of the rule revision, the post-trial report submitted to the Chief Judge, then transmitted to the Tax Court judge assigned to make the final decision, has been both withheld from the public and excluded from the record on appeal.  Further, since that time, Tax Court judges have refrained from disclosing, in any case, whether the final decision in fact \xe2\x80\x9cmodi[fies]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creject[s] [the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report] in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. Rule 183(c), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 1619.  Instead, the final decision invariably begins with a stock statement that the Tax Court judge \xe2\x80\x9cagrees with and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Investment Research Assoc., Ltd.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 78 TCM 951, 963 (1999), \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, pp. 2562\xe2\x80\x932563.  Whether and how the opinion thus adopted deviates from the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s original report is never made public.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are taxpayers who were unsuccessful in the Tax Court and on appeal.  They object to the concealment of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report and, in particular, exclusion of the report from the record on appeal.  They urge that, under the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s current practice, the parties and the Court of Appeals lack essential information: One cannot tell whether, as Rule 183(c) requires, the final decision reflects \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d for the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to evaluate the credibility of [the] witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d and presumes the correctness of that judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial fact findings.  We agree that no statute authorizes, and the current text of Rule 183 does not warrant, the concealment at issue.  We so hold, mindful that it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose the initial report of a hearing officer, and to make that report part of the record available to an appellate forum.  A departure of the bold character practiced by the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x94the creation and attribution solely to the special trial judge of a superseding report composed in unrevealed collaboration with a regular Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x94demands, at the very least, full and fair statement in the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s own Rules.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After repeated Internal Revenue Service audits spanning several years, taxpayers Claude Ballard, Burton W.

Those payments, the Commissioner alleged, were then distributed to Kanter, Ballard, and Lisle, or to entities they controlled.  Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle did not report the payments on their individual tax returns.

The post-trial proceedings in the case are not fully memorialized in either the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket records or its published orders, but certain salient events can be traced.  On or before September 2, 1998, Judge Couvillion submitted to the Chief Judge a report containing his findings of fact and opinion, \xe2\x80\x9cas required by [Tax Court] Rule 183(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  Order of Dec. 15, 1999, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert.\xc2\xa0113a\xe2\x80\x93114a.  On September 2, 1998, the Chief Judge assigned the case to Tax Court Judge Howard A.

That same day, Judge Dawson issued the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Dawson found that Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle had acted with intent to deceive the Commissioner, and held them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penalties.

In so ruling, Judge Dawson purported to adopt the findings contained in the report submitted by Judge Couvillion: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 963, \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, pp. 2562\xe2\x80\x932563.  Judge Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s decision consists in its entirety of a document, over 600 pages in length, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cOpinion of the Special Trial Judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The taxpayers came to believe that the document titled \xe2\x80\x9cOpinion of the Special Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x9d was <em>not</em> in fact a reproduction of Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report.  A declaration, dated August 21, 2000, submitted by Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Randall G. Dick, accounts for this belief.  Dick attested to conversations with two Tax Court judges regarding the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  According to the declaration, the judges told Dick that in the Rule 183(b) report submitted to the Chief Judge, Judge Couvillion had concluded that Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle did not owe taxes with respect to payments made by certain individuals seeking to do business with Prudential, and that the fraud penalty was not applicable.

Attorney Dick\xe2\x80\x99s declaration further stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn my conversations with the judges of the Tax Court, I was told the following: That substantial sections of the opinion were not written by Judge Couvillion, and that those sections containing findings related to the credibility of witnesses and findings related to fraud were wholly contrary to the findings made by Judge Couvillion in his report.  The changes to Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s findings relating to credibility and fraud were made by Judge Dawson.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb65, at 309a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concerned that Judge Dawson had modified or rejected special trial judge findings tending in their favor, see Tax Ct. Rule 183(c), the taxpayers filed three successive motions in the Tax Court; each motion sought access to the report Special Trial Judge Couvillion had submitted to the Chief Judge or, in the alternative, permission to place the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report under seal in the record on appeal.  See Order of Aug. 30, 2000, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 99a\xe2\x80\x93101a; Motion of May 25, 2000, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 105a.  The Tax Court denied the motions.  See Order of Aug. 30, 2000, <em>supra,</em> at 100a\xe2\x80\x93101a, 103a.  In response to the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 third motion, filed in August 2000, the Tax Court elaborated: \xe2\x80\x9cJudge Dawson states and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agrees, that, after a meticulous and time-consuming review of the complex record in these cases, Judge Dawson adopted the findings of fact and opinion of Special Trial Judge Couvillion, \xe2\x80\xa6 Judge Dawson presumed the findings of fact recommended by Special Trial Judge Couvillion were correct, and \xe2\x80\xa6 Judge Dawson gave due regard\xe2\x80\x9d to Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s credibility findings.  <em>Id.,</em> at 102a.  To the extent that the taxpayers sought \xe2\x80\x9cany preliminary drafts\xe2\x80\x9d of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report, the Tax Court added, such documents are \xe2\x80\x9cnot subject to production because they relate to the internal deliberative processes of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 101a (quoting Order of Apr. 26, 2000, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 (TC), <em>supra,</em> at 109a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appeals from Tax Court decisions are taken to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the taxpayer resides.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77482(b)(1)(A).  Ballard therefore appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, Kanter to the Seventh Circuit, and Lisle to the Fifth Circuit.  All three Courts of Appeals accepted the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s signature on the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s final decision rendered that decision in fact Special Trial Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s report.  <em>Estate of Kanter</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d 833, 840\xe2\x80\x93841 (CA7 2003); <em>Ballard</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1042; accord <em>Estate of Lisle</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 364, 384 (CA5 2003) (adopting the reasoning of the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits without elaboration).  The appeals courts further agreed with the Commissioner that the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s original report, submitted to the Chief Judge pursuant to Rule 183(b), qualified as a confidential document, shielded as part of the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s internal deliberative process.

We now reverse the decisions of the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits upholding the exclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Central to these cases is Tax Court Rule 183, which delineates the procedural framework and substantive standards governing Tax Court review of special trial judge findings.  Rule 183(b), captioned \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x99s Report,\xe2\x80\x9d provides that after the trial of a case and submission of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Special Trial Judge shall submit a report, including findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, and the Chief Judge will assign the case to a Judge \xe2\x80\xa6 of the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p.\xc2\xa01619.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Rule 183(c), directed to the Tax Court judge to whom the case is assigned for final decision, reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAction on the Report: The Judge to whom \xe2\x80\xa6 the case is assigned may adopt the Special Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part, or may direct the filing of additional briefs or may receive further evidence or may direct oral argument, or may recommit the report with instructions.  Due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the Special Trial Judge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and the findings of fact recommended by the Special Trial Judge shall be presumed to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Tax Court judge assigned to take action on the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report in these cases invoked none of the means Rule 183(c) provides to supplement the record.  He did not \xe2\x80\x9cdirect the filing of additional briefs[,] receive further evidence or \xe2\x80\xa6 direct oral argument.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid</em>.  Nor does the record show, or the Commissioner contend, see Brief for Respondent 14\xe2\x80\x9315, that the Tax Court judge \xe2\x80\x9crecommit[ed] the [special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s] report with instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 183(c).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  From all that appears on the record, then, Judge Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s review of the factfindings contained in Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s report rested on the Rule 183(b) report itself, the trial transcript, and the other documents on file.  Rule 183(c) guides the appraisal of those filed materials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 183(c)\xe2\x80\x99s origin confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that deference is due to factfindings made by the trial judge.  Commenting in 1973 on then newly adopted Rule 182(d), the precursor to Rule 183(c), the Tax Court observed that the Rule was modeled on Rule 147(b) of the former Court of Claims.  Tax Ct. Rule 182 note, 60 T. C. 1150 (Tax Court review procedures were to be \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable\xe2\x80\x9d to those used in the Court of Claims).  Rule 182(d)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct\xe2\x80\x9d formulations were taken directly from that earlier Rule,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] which the Court of Claims interpreted to require respectful attention to the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact.  See <em>Hebah </em>v.<em> United States</em>, 456 F. 2d 696, 698 (Ct. Cl. 1972) (challenger must make \xe2\x80\x9ca strong affirmative showing\xe2\x80\x9d to overcome the presumption of correctness that attaches to trial judge findings).  The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment of Court of Claims Rule 147(b) as the model for its own Rule, indeed the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of nearly identical language, lead to the conclusion the Tax Court itself expressed: Under the Rule formerly designated Rule 182(b), now designated 183(c), special trial judge findings carry \xe2\x80\x9cspecial weight insofar as those findings are determined by the opportunity to hear and observe the witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tax Ct. Rule 182 note, 60 T. C. 1150 (1973); see <em>Stone </em>v.<em> Commissioner</em>, 865 F. 2d 342, 345 (CADC 1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under Rule 182 as it was formulated in 1973, the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report was a transparent process.  Rule 182(b) provided for service of copies of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report on the parties and Rule 182(c) allowed parties to file exceptions to the report.  60 T. C., at 1149.  The process resembled a district court\xe2\x80\x99s review of a magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and recommendation: The regular Tax Court judge reviewed the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report independently, on the basis of the record and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 objections to the report.  See Rule 182(c), (d), <em>id.,</em> at 1149\xe2\x80\x931150.  In years before 1984, the Tax Court acknowledged instances in which it \xe2\x80\x9cdisagree[d] with the Special Trial Judge,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Rosenbaum</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 45 TCM 825, 827 (1983), \xc2\xb683,113 P\xe2\x80\x93H Memo TC, p. 373,<em> </em>or modified the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings, see <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 41 TCM 539 (1980), \xc2\xb680,552 P\xe2\x80\x93H Memo TC, p. 2344 (adopting special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report with \xe2\x80\x9csome modifications\xe2\x80\x9d).  Parties were therefore equipped to argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings the measure of respect required by Rule 182(d)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct\xe2\x80\x9d formulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1983, the Tax Court amended the Rule, which it simultaneously renumbered as Rule 183.  The 1983 change eliminated the provision, formerly in Rule 182(b), for service of copies of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report on the parties; it also eliminated the procedure, formerly in Rule 182(c), permitting the parties to file exceptions to the report.  See Rule 183 note, 81 T. C., at 1069\xe2\x80\x931070.  The Tax Court left intact, however, the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s call for \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determinations and the instruction that \xe2\x80\x9cthe findings of fact recommended by the Special Trial Judge shall be presumed to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 183(c), <em>id.</em>, at 1069.  Further, the 1983 amendments did not purport to change the character of the action the Tax Court judge could take on the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report; as before, the Tax Court could \xe2\x80\x9cadopt\xe2\x80\x9d the report, \xe2\x80\x9cmodify it,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creject it in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In practice, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging instances in which it rejected or modified special trial judge findings.  Judge Cudahy, in dissent in the Seventh Circuit, commented on the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary unanimity\xe2\x80\x9d that has prevailed since the 1983 amendments: \xe2\x80\x9cNever, in any instance since the adoption of the current Rule 183 that I could find,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Cudahy reported, \xe2\x80\x9chas a Tax Court judge <em>not</em> agreed with and adopted the [special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s] opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 876; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (Counsel for the Commissioner, in response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s question, stated: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of any cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the [special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s] findings\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It appears from these cases and from the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s representations to this Court that the Tax Court, following the 1983 amendments to Rule 183, inaugurated a novel practice regarding the report the special trial judge submits post-trial to the Chief Judge.  No longer does the Tax Court judge assigned to the case alone review the report and issue a decision adopting it, modifying it, or rejecting it in whole or in part.  Instead, the Tax Court judge treats the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report essentially as an in-house draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular judge and the special trial judge.  See <em>id.,</em> at 38 (Counsel for the Commissioner acknowledged that the special trial judge and regular Tax Court judge engage in \xe2\x80\x9ca collegial deliberative process,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such a process, \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving more than one person . . . in the decision-making,\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.</em>, at 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe deliberative process\xe2\x80\x9d occurring after the special trial judge submits his report to the Chief Judge); <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F. 3d, at 876\xe2\x80\x93877 (Cudahy, J., dissenting).

The extent to which that \xe2\x80\x9copinion\xe2\x80\x9d modifies or rejects the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) findings and opinion, and is in significant part prompted or written by the regular Tax Court judge, is undisclosed.  Cf.

That opinion, included in a report completed and submitted <em>before</em> a regular Tax Court judge is assigned to the case, is the sole opinion properly ascribed to the special trial judge under the current Rules.  Correspondingly, it is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c), tellingly captioned \xe2\x80\x9cAction on the Report,\xe2\x80\x9d instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject.

Although the Tax Court is not without leeway in interpreting its own Rules, it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 an unprovided-for collaborative process, and to interpret the formulations \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d to convey something other than what those same words meant prior to the 1983 rule changes.

In directing the Tax Court judge to give \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s credibility determinations and to \xe2\x80\x9cpresum[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 correct\xe2\x80\x9d the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfindings, Rule 183(c) recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The officer who hears witnesses and sifts through evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a paper record.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fraud cases, in particular, may involve critical credibility assessments, rendering the appraisals of the judge who presided at trial vital to the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate determinations.  These cases are illustrative.  The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision repeatedly draws outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard, Kanter, and several other witnesses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Investment Research Assoc.</em>, 78 TCM, at 1060, \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, p. 2675 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe find Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony to be implausible.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 1083, \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, p. 2703 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e find Ballard\xe2\x80\x99s testimony vague, evasive, and unreliable.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 1079, \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, p. 2698 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe testimony of Thomas Lisle, Melinda Ballard, Hart, and Albrecht is not credible.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 1140, \xc2\xb699,407 RIA Memo TC, p. 2776 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he witnesses presented on behalf of [Investment Research Associates] in this case were obviously biased, and their testimony was not credible.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Absent access to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report in this and similar cases, the appellate court will be at a loss to determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings made in that report were accorded \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and were \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed \xe2\x80\xa6 correct\xe2\x80\x9d by the Tax Court judge, or (2) whether they were displaced without adherence to those standards.  See <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 886 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cI can think of no single item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the [special trial judge] who stood watch over the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner urges, however, that the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report is an internal draft, a mere \xe2\x80\x9cstep\xe2\x80\x9d in a \xe2\x80\x9cconfidential decisional process,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore properly withheld from a reviewing court.

The Commissioner may not rely on the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary construction of its own rules to insulate special trial judge reports from disclosure.  Cf. <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 888 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (access on appeal to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 183(b) report should not be blocked by the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconcealment of [its] revision process behind th[e] verbal formula\xe2\x80\x9d through which the Tax Court judge purports to \xe2\x80\x9cagre[e] with and adop[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the opinion of the special trial judge (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are all the more resistant to the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s concealment of the only special trial judge report its Rules authorize given the generally prevailing practice regarding a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s use of hearing officers. <em> </em>The initial findings or recommendations of magistrate judges, special masters, and bankruptcy judges are available to the appellate court authorized to review the operative decision of the district court.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa7636(b)(1)(C) (magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s proposed findings must be filed with the court and mailed to the parties); Fed. Rule Civ.

In comparison to the nearly universal practice of transparency in forums in which one official conducts the trial (and thus sees and hears the witnesses), and another official subsequently renders the final decision, the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice is anomalous.  As one observer asked: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f there are policy reasons that dictate transparency for everyone else, why do these reasons not apply to the Tax Court?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F. 3d, at 874 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. <em>Mazza</em> v. <em>Cavicchia</em>, 15 N.\xc2\xa0J. 498, 519, 105 A.\xc2\xa02d 545, 557 (1954) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not been able to find a single case in any state \xe2\x80\xa6 justifying or attempting to justify the use of secret reports by a hearer to the head of an administrative agency.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commissioner asserts, however, that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice of replacing the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report with a \xe2\x80\x9ccollaborative\xe2\x80\x9d report and refusing to disclose the initial report is neither \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9caberrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 31.  As a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect <em>statutory</em> analog,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> the Commissioner points to 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa77460(b), the provision governing cases reviewed by the full Tax Court. Section 7460(b) instructs that when the full Tax Court reviews the decision of a single Tax Court judge, the initial one-judge decision \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be a part of the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  For several reasons, we reject the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s endeavor to equate proceedings that differ markedly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, as the Commissioner himself observes, omission of the single Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x99s opinion from the record when full court review occurs has been the <em>statutory</em> rule \xe2\x80\x9c[f]rom the earliest days of the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 31 (citing Revenue Act of 1928, ch. 852, \xc2\xa7601, 45 Stat. 871).  To this day, Congress has ordered no corresponding omission of special trial judge initial reports.  Understandably so.  Full Tax Court review is designed for the resolution of legal issues, not for review of findings of fact made by the judge who presided at trial.  See L. Lederman &amp; S. Mazza, Tax Controversies: Practice and Procedure 247 (2000).  When the full Tax Court reviews, it is making a <em>de novo</em> determination of the legal issue presented.  In contrast, findings of fact are key to special trial judge reports.  See Tax Ct. Rule 183(c), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p. 1619.  And those findings, under the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rules, are not subject to review <em>de novo</em>.  Instead, they are measured against \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed correct\xe2\x80\x9d standards.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the judges composing the full Tax Court and the individual Tax Court judge who made the decision under review are presidential appointees equal in rank.  Each has an equal voice in the business of the Tax Court.  To the extent that the individual judge disagrees with his colleagues, he is free to file a dissenting opinion repeating or borrowing from his initial decision.  The special trial judge, serving at the pleasure of the Tax Court, lacks the independence enjoyed by regular Tax Court judges and the prerogative to publish dissenting views.  See <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F. 3d, at 879\xe2\x80\x93880 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note, finally, other arguments tendered by the taxpayers.  Ballard and Kanter urge that the Due Process Clause requires disclosure of a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s factfindings that have operative weight in a court\xe2\x80\x99s final decision.  Brief for Petitioner Ballard 43\xe2\x80\x9348; Brief for Petitioner Kanter 19\xe2\x80\x9327.  They also argue that, just as reports of special masters, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges form part of the record on appeal from a district court, so special trial judge reports must form part of the record on appeal from the Tax Court.  They base this argument on the appellate review statute, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77482(a)(1), which instructs courts of appeals to review Tax Court decisions \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner Ballard 23\xe2\x80\x9327 (internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for Petitioner Kanter 27, 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  In addition, they maintain that 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77459(b) and 7461(a) require disclosure of all reports generated in Tax Court proceedings, absent specific exemption. Brief for Petitioner Kanter 42\xe2\x80\x9344.  Because we hold that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rules do not authorize the practice that the Tax Court now follows, we need not reach these arguments and express no opinion on them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The idiosyncratic procedure the Commissioner describes and defends, although not the system of adjudication that Rule 183 currently creates, is one the Tax Court might some day adopt.  Were the Tax Court to amend its Rules to express the changed character of the Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x99s review of special trial judge reports, that change would, of course, be subject to appellate review for consistency with the relevant federal statutes and due process.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments of the Courts of Appeal for the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Unlike other judicial and administrative bodies, the Tax Court does not maintain a formal practice of publicly disclosing proposed amendments to its Rules.

Moreover, if the special trial judge, on re-reading his Rule 183(b) report post-submission, detects an error of substance, the special trial judge might ask to have the report \xe2\x80\x9crecommit[ted]\xe2\x80\x9d for modification.  See Rule 183(c).</p>\n<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is curious that the Commissioner, always a party in Tax Court proceedings, argues strenuously in support of concealment of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.  As Judge Cudahy noted, the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s current practice allows it \xe2\x80\x9cvery easily [to] reverse findings (credibility-related and otherwise) of [special trial judges] in a manner that is detrimental to the Commissioner as well as to\xe2\x80\x9d taxpayers.  <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F. 3d, at 888 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Inclusion of the report in the record on appeal would therefore seem \xe2\x80\x9ca procedural result that may benefit all parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see Tr. of Oral Arg. 28 (Court inquired of counsel for the Commissioner: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ren\xe2\x80\x99t there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were?\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Commissioner also notes that \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous boards of contract appeals established by various agencies \xe2\x80\xa6 do not require disclosure of initial reports prepared by presiding judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  This analogy, too, is unimpressive.  The contract dispute resolution panels to which the Commissioner points issue decisions after reviewing the initial report of a \xe2\x80\x9cpresiding judge,\xe2\x80\x9d designated to conduct an evidentiary hearing on behalf of the panel.  Only the final decision is served on the parties and included in the record on appeal.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Unlike the situation of the special trial judge, however, the presiding judge holds a position equal in stature to that of the other panel members, and can file a dissent.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner Kanter 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In discussing the text of Rule 183(b) and (c), and the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s current interpretation of that text, we surely do not intend to \xe2\x80\x9cimpugn the integrity\xe2\x80\x9d of any Tax Court judge.  Compare <em>post </em>(opinion of Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0 J.), at 5\xe2\x80\x936, with <em>Kanter</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 880, n.\xc2\xa06 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cI am not suggesting that \xe2\x80\xa6 the judges of the Tax Court \xe2\x80\xa6 exert undue influence over [special trial judges].

Accepting the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\xe2\x80\x99s contrary construction would require reading the word \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d in subdivisions (b) and (c) to mean two different things.  One additional indication in the text, moreover, is contrary to the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Rule 183(c) authorizes the Tax Court judge to \xe2\x80\x9crecommit the report with instructions\xe2\x80\x9d to the special trial judge.  Recommittal is generally a formal mechanism for initiating reconsideration or other formal action by the initial decisionmaker.  See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 72(b) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommended decision, receive further evidence, or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions\xe2\x80\x9d); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 53(e)(2) (amended 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe court after hearing may adopt the [special master\xe2\x80\x99s] report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions\xe2\x80\x9d); cf<em>.</em> <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 17) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe accept the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and recommit the case to the Special Master for preparation of a decree consistent with this opinion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that Tax Ct. Rule 183(c) provides a formal channel for the Tax Court judge to send a report back to the special trial judge for reconsideration, it is difficult to interpret the Rule to permit the informal process the Commissioner and the dissenting opinion defend here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Tax Court deems it necessary to allow informal consultation and collaboration between the special trial judge and the Tax Court judge, it might design a rule for that process.  If, on the other hand, it were to insist on more formality\xe2\x80\x94with deference to the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report and an obligation on the part of the Tax Court judge to describe the reasons for any substantial departures from the original findings\xe2\x80\x94without requiring disclosure of the initial report, that would present a more problematic approach.  It is not often that a rule requiring deference to the original factfinder exists, but the affected parties have no means of ensuring its enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That brings us to the questions of how these cases should be resolved on remand and how the current version of the Rule should be interpreted in later cases.  As to the former, this question is difficult because we do not know what happened in the Tax Court, a point that is important to underscore here.  From a single affidavit, the majority extrapolates \xe2\x80\x9ca novel practice\xe2\x80\x9d whereby the Tax Court treats the initial special trial judge report as \xe2\x80\x9can in-house draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular judge and the special trial judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  I interpret the opinion as indicating that there might be such a practice, not that there is.  The dissent, in contrast, appears to assume that any changes to the initial report were the result of reconsideration by the special trial judge or informal suggestions by the Tax Court judge.  <em>Post</em>, at 4 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Given the sparse record before us, I would not be so quick to make either assumption, particularly given that the Commissioner, charged with defending the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, is no more privy to the inner workings of the Tax Court than we are.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the lingering uncertainty about whether the initial report was in fact altered or superseded, and the extent of any changes, there are factual questions that still must be resolved.  If the initial report was not substantially altered, then there will have been no violation of the Rule.  If, on the other hand, substantial revisions were made during a collaborative effort between the special trial judge and the Tax Court judge, the Tax Court might remedy that breach of the Rule in different ways.  For instance, it could simply recommit the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report and start over from there.  More likely in these circumstances the remedy would be for the Tax Court to disclose the report that Judge Couvillion submitted on or before September 2, 1998. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This leads to the question of how Rule 183 should be interpreted in future cases.  Rule 183\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of deference to the special trial judge surely implies that the parties to the litigation will have the means of knowing whether deference has been given and of mounting a challenge if it has not.  Thus, a reasonable reading of the Rule requires the litigants and the courts of appeals to be able to evaluate any changes made to the findings of fact in the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial report.  Including the original findings of fact in the record on appeal would make that possible. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of these matters should be addressed in the first instance by the Courts of Appeals or by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961795">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nREHNQUIST, C.

The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with its own Rules is a matter on which we should defer to the interpretation of that court.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tax Court interprets Rule 183 not to require the disclosure of the report submitted by the special trial judge pursuant to paragraph (b) when the Tax Court judge adopts the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.  In 1983, the Tax Court amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement that the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s submitted report be disclosed to the parties so that they could file exceptions before the Tax Court judge acted on the report.  See Tax Ct. Rule 183 note, 81 T.\xc2\xa0C. 1069\xe2\x80\x931070 (1984).  The 1983 amendment also changed the Rule to require that the special trial judge \xe2\x80\x9csubmit\xe2\x80\x9d his report to the Chief Judge instead of \xe2\x80\x9cfile\xe2\x80\x9d it, see Tax Ct. Rule 182(b), 60 T.\xc2\xa0C. 1150 (1973), thereby removing the initial report from the appellate record.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(a)(1) (requiring the record on appeal contain \xe2\x80\x9cthe original papers and exhibits <em>filed</em> in the district court\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with these amendments, in an opinion signed by Judge Dawson, Special Trial Judge Couvillion, and Chief Judge Wells, the Tax Court held that disclosure of the Rule 183(b) report was not required in these cases because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only official Memorandum Findings of Fact and Opinion by the Court in these cases is T.\xc2\xa0C. Memo. 1999\xe2\x80\x93407, filed on December 15, 1999, by Special Trial Judge Couvillion, reviewed and adopted by Judge Dawson, and reviewed and approved by former Chief Judge Cohen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order of Aug. 30, 2000, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 102a (hereinafter Order of Aug. 30, App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert.).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s brief makes clear that any changes that might exist between the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial opinion and his final opinion \xe2\x80\x9cwould presumptively be the result of the [special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s] legitimate reevaluation of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 11; accord, Brief for Appellee in No. 01\xe2\x80\x9317249 (CA11), pp. 92\xe2\x80\x9393; Brief for Appellee in No. 01\xe2\x80\x934316 etc. (CA7), pp. 122\xe2\x80\x93123.  Thus, consistent with its practice during the more than 20 years since Rule 183 was adopted in its current form, the Tax Court interprets Rule 183 as not requiring disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9cany preliminary drafts of reports or opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order of Apr. 26, 2000, in No. 43966\xe2\x80\x9385 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 109a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because this interpretation of Rule 183 is reasonable, it should be accepted.  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own rule or regulation is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/325/410/index.html">325 U. S. 410</a>, 414 (1945); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/200/index.html">532 U.

To the contrary, Rule 183 mandates only that action be taken on \xe2\x80\x9cthe Special Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Rule is silent on whether the special trial judge may correct technical or substantive errors in his original report after it is submitted to the Chief Judge and before the Tax Court judge takes action, either on his own initiative or by informal suggestion.  Paragraph (c)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the possessive \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report\xe2\x80\x9d is most naturally read to refer to the report authored and ascribed to by the special trial judge.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  If the special trial judge changes his report, then the new version becomes \xe2\x80\x9cthe Special Trial Judge\xe2\x80\x99s report.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s signature that makes the report attributable to him.  At the very least, it is not unreasonable or arbitrary for the Tax Court to construe the Rule as not requiring the disclosure of preliminary drafts or reports.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  See <em>Estate of Kanter </em>v.<em> Commissioner</em>, 337 F.\xc2\xa03d 833, 841 (CA7 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is clear that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s own rules do not require the report to be disclosed \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that judicial review is impeded withstand scrutiny.  Because paragraph (c) can be read, as the Tax Court does, to permit the adoption of the report authored and signed by the special trial judge, the Courts of Appeals both determined that Tax Judge Dawson expressly adopted Special Trial Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s report.  <em>Id.</em>, at 840\xe2\x80\x93841; <em>Ballard </em>v.<em> Commissioner</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d 1037, 1038\xe2\x80\x931039 (CA11 2003).  There can be no doubt that in <em>adopting</em> Special Trial Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact as well as his legal conclusions in their entirety, Tax Court Judge Dawson complied with whatever degree of deference is required by Rule 183(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claimed distinctions, the statutory requirement that a Tax Court judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial opinion not be published when the Chief Judge directs that such opinion be reviewed by the full Tax Court is quite analogous to the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Rule 183.  See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77460(b); <em>Estate of Varian</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 396 F.\xc2\xa02d 753 (CA9 1968).  A Tax Court judge whose decision is being reviewed may dissent from the full court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Similarly, the special trial judge may choose not to change his initial findings of fact and opinion.  In order to distinguish \xc2\xa77460(b), the Court implies that Tax Court Judge Dawson exercised, or at least may have exercised, undue influence or improper control over Special Trial Judge Couvillion.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 20.  This Court generally does not assume abdication or impropriety,<em> </em>see <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/868/index.html">501 U.

This Court should therefore defer to the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Rule, as amended in 1983, allowing the disclosure of only the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report that was adopted by the Tax Court judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As every Court of Appeals to consider the arguments has concluded, the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s statutory and constitutional arguments are not colorable.  See <em>Estate of Lisle </em>v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 364, 384 (CA5 2003); <em>Estate of Kanter </em>v.<em> Commissioner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 840\xe2\x80\x93843; <em>Ballard </em>v.<em> Commissioner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1042\xe2\x80\x931043.  I agree with those conclusions.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would affirm the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It bespeaks the weakness of the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that the Court hinges its conclusion on an argument not even presented for our consideration.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46 (Deputy Solicitor General Hungar noting that compliance with Rule 183 was not included within the questions presented).  This Court does not consider claims that are not included within a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s questions presented.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(a); <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 535\xe2\x80\x93538 (1992).  Two of the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 three claims included in the four questions presented do not even mention Rule 183, instead claiming violations of due process, U. S. Const., Art.

The only question presented that mentions Rule 183 is limited to asking whether Rule 183 requires the Tax Court to uphold findings of fact made by a special trial judge unless they are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clearly erroneous.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Kanter Pet. for Cert.

S. 868</a>, 887\xe2\x80\x93888 (1991), there is no reason why <em>Seminole Rock</em> deference does not extend to the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own procedural rules.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Respondent 11 (noting that any changes to a special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report \xe2\x80\x9cwould presumptively be the result of the STJ\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate reevaluation of the case\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way it is possible for there to be a change is for the special trial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his responsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a mistake\xe2\x80\x9d); Order of Aug. 30, App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert. 102a (indicating the adopted report was written \xe2\x80\x9cby Special Trial Judge Couvillion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadopted by Judge Dawson\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, following the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation that a Tax Court judge must act on the report submitted pursuant to paragraph (b), a Tax Court judge would be required to presume correct any factual findings that a special trial judge had disclaimed.  For example, if the Special Trial Judge, after submitting a copy of his report to the Chief Judge, found a critical typographical error that the Tax Court judge might not recognize as such, then the Tax Court judge would be required, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, to defer to the report as initially drafted instead of a corrected version of the report.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Any implication that Judge Dawson used his higher \xe2\x80\x9crank\xe2\x80\x9d to exert improper influence or control is particularly inapt in these cases: Judge Dawson, as a retired Tax Court judge recalled into duty by the Chief Judge, has absolutely no authority over Special Trial Judge Couvillion as both serve at the will of the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Judge.  See 26 U.

A similar degree of agreement was evident <em>prior</em> to 1983 when the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report was filed and served on the parties, who had the opportunity to file exceptions.  From 1976 to 1983, for example, less than one percent (6 out of 680) of special trial judge reports were not adopted by the Tax Court judge, only 1 case reversed the special trial judge, and only 14 cases involved adoption with mostly minor modifications.  See Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318, and n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0With respect to the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 statutory arguments, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77459 and 7461 require only the disclosure of reports adopted by the Tax Court and not those reports that are not adopted.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77459 (\xe2\x80\x9cshall be the duty of the Tax Court \xe2\x80\xa6 to include in <em>its</em> report upon any proceeding its findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)), 7461 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eports <em>of the Tax Court</em>\xe2\x80\x9d shall be public records) (emphasis added).  Section 7482, which requires courts of appeals to review \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions of the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x9d in the same manner as they review similar district court decisions, was passed to eliminate any special deference paid to Tax Court decisions, see <em>Dobson</em> v. <em>Commissioner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/320/489/index.html">320 U.

Disclosure of any report that has been abandoned by the special trial judge is in no way necessary to effective appellate review because the adoption of the special trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s report ensures that sufficient deference was given.  Nor must all reports be disclosed in order for the Tax Court procedure itself to comport with due process.
