B. Harwood, one of the appellants, since the date of said decree, the property therein decreed to be sold for the satisfaction of the sums found due to the complainants, has greatly depreciated and is constantly depreciating, and for the want of the care and attention which it had in the lifetime of the said N. B. Harwood, and would now have but for his death, the security is altogether inadequate, and for such further or other relief or order as may be proper in the premises."</p>\n<p>MR.

McCarter,</a></span></em> 21 Wall. 17.  "The circumstances of the case, or of the parties," have not been so changed by the death of N. B. Harwood, one of the appellants, as to make "the security, which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 117 U.

The sole purpose of the suit is to subject the lands in question to the payment of debts of Harwood, the deceased appellant.  The affidavits do not satisfy us that the property is depreciating in value by reason of any neglect of the surviving appellants in its care or management.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
