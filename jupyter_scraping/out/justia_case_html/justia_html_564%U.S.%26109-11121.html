Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen items was found at J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s school and seen in his possession, Investigator DiCostanzo went to the school.  A uniformed police officer on detail to the school took J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. from his classroom to a closed-door conference room, where police and school administrators questioned him for at least 30 minutes.  Before beginning, they did not give him <em>Miranda</em> warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his legal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room.  He first denied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.  DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer questions and was free to leave.  Asked whether he understood, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the stolen items.  He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\xe2\x80\x99s request.  When the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus home.  Two juvenile petitions were filed against J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B., charging him with breaking and entering and with larceny.  His public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. had been interrogated in a custodial setting without being afforded <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that his statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.  J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress.  The court adjudicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court affirmed.  The latter court declined to find J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police custody.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A child\xe2\x80\x99s age properly informs <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s custody analysis.

Whether a suspect is \xe2\x80\x9cin custody\xe2\x80\x9d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is an objective determination involving two discrete inquires: \xe2\x80\x9cfirst, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>Keohane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/99/index.html">516 U.

However, the test involves no consideration of the particular suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cactual mindset.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Alvarado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/652/index.html">541 U.

By limiting analysis to objective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating each suspect\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncrasies and divining how those particular traits affect that suspect\xe2\x80\x99s subjective state of mind.  <em>Berkemer</em> v. <em>McCarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U.

S., at 325.  Courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis.  A child\xe2\x80\x99s age is far \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a chronological fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 115.  It is a fact that \xe2\x80\x9cgenerates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a class.  Children \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally are less mature and responsible than adults,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Eddings</em>, 455 U. S., at 115; they \xe2\x80\x9coften lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bellotti</em> v. <em>Baird</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/index.html">443 U. S. 622</a>, 635; and they \xe2\x80\x9care more vulnerable or susceptible to \xe2\x80\xa6 outside pressures\xe2\x80\x9d than adults, <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 569.  In the specific context of police interrogation, events that \xe2\x80\x9cwould leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a\xe2\x80\x9d teen.  <em>Haley</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/596/index.html">332 U. S. 596</a>, 599.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  Legal disqualifications on children as a class\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, limitations on their ability to marry without parental consent\xe2\x80\x94exhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given a history \xe2\x80\x9creplete with laws and judicial recognition\xe2\x80\x9d that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults, <em>Eddings</em>, 455 U. S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116, there is no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the child\xe2\x80\x99s age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cunknowable\xe2\x80\x9d to them, <em>Berkemer</em>, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9canticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies\xe2\x80\x9d of the particular suspect being questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 662.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not involve a determination of how youth affects a particular child\xe2\x80\x99s subjective state of mind.  In fact, were the court precluded from taking J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school are specific to children.  These conclusions are not undermined by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation in <em>Alvarado </em>that accounting for a juvenile\xe2\x80\x99s age in the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis \xe2\x80\x9ccould be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d 541 U. S., at 668.  The Court said nothing about whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214.  So long as the child\xe2\x80\x99s age was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consistent with the <em>Miranda </em>test\xe2\x80\x99s objective nature.  This does not mean that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore.

S. 436</a> (1966).  It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to leave.  Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age properly informs the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was the second time that police questioned J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother\xe2\x80\x94his legal guardian\xe2\x80\x94as well as his aunt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s middle school and seen in J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-\ncers nor the school administrators contacted J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The uniformed officer interrupted J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon social studies class, removed J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. from the classroom, and escorted him to a school conference room.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  There, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was given neither <em>Miranda</em> warnings nor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother.  Nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Questioning began with small talk\xe2\x80\x94discussion of sports and J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. behind her house; and confronted J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. to \xe2\x80\x9cdo the right thing,\xe2\x80\x9d warning J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. that \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth always comes out in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 99a, 112a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eventually, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. asked whether he would \xe2\x80\x9cstill be in trouble\xe2\x80\x9d if he returned the \xe2\x80\x9cstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In response, DiCostanzo explained that return of the stolen items would be helpful, but \xe2\x80\x9cthis thing is going to court\xe2\x80\x9d regardless.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 112a; <em>ibid. </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hat\xe2\x80\x99s done is done[;] now you need to help yourself by making it right\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.</em>, at 99a.  DiCostanzo then warned that he may need to seek a secure custody order if he believed that J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. would continue to break into other homes.  When J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. asked what a secure custody order was, DiCostanzo explained that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s where you get sent to juvenile detention before court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 112a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. confessed that he and a friend were responsible for the break-ins.  DiCostanzo only then informed J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. that he could refuse to answer the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s questions and that he was free to leave.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Asked whether he understood, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. nodded and provided further detail, including information about the location of the stolen items.  Eventually J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\xe2\x80\x99s request.  When the bell rang indicating the end of the schoolday, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two juvenile petitions were filed against J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B., each alleging one count of breaking and entering and one count of larceny.  J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that suppression was necessary because J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. had been \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogated by police in a custodial setting without being afforded <em>Miranda </em>warning[s],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 89a, and because his statements were involuntary under the totality of the circumstances test, <em>id.</em>, at 142a; see <em>Schneckloth</em> v. <em>Bustamonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U.

After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. delinquent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re J.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>D.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>B.</em>, 196 N.\xc2\xa0C.

The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464\xe2\x80\x93*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on children\xe2\x80\x99s legal capacity under the common law \xe2\x80\x9csecure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Like this Court\xe2\x80\x99s own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consent\xe2\x80\x94exhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, even where a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a person\xe2\x80\x99s childhood is a relevant circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d to be considered.

S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the child\xe2\x80\x99s age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cunknowable\xe2\x80\x9d to them, <em>Berkemer</em>, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to \xe2\x80\x9canticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies\xe2\x80\x9d of the particular suspect whom they question, <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same \xe2\x80\x9cwide basis of community experience\xe2\x80\x9d that makes it possible, as an objective matter, \xe2\x80\x9cto determine what is to be expected\xe2\x80\x9d of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7283A, at 15; see <em>supra</em>, at 10, and n.\xc2\xa06, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, a child\xe2\x80\x99s age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable person\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of his freedom of action.  <em>Alvarado</em>, holds, for instance, that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be \xe2\x80\x9ccontingent [on the] psycholog[y]\xe2\x80\x9d of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  <em>Ibid.  </em>A child\xe2\x80\x99s age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselves\xe2\x80\x94among others, that children are \xe2\x80\x9cmost susceptible to influence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Eddings</em>, 455 U.

This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.\xe2\x80\x99s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to \xe2\x80\x9cdo the right thing\xe2\x80\x9d; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns \xe2\x80\x9cregarding the application of the <em>Miranda </em>custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 17 (opinion of Alito, J.), the effect of the schoolhouse setting cannot be disentangled from the identity of the person questioned.  A student\xe2\x80\x94whose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary action\xe2\x80\x94is in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person \xe2\x80\x9cquestioned in school\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cminor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> the coercive effect of the schoolhouse setting is unknowable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our prior decision in <em>Alvarado </em>in no way undermines these conclusions.  In that case, we held that a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s age as part of the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable under the deferential standard of review set forth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.  Like the North Carolina Supreme Court here, see 363 N.\xc2\xa0C., at 672, 686 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d, at 140, we observed that accounting for a juvenile\xe2\x80\x99s age in the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis \xe2\x80\x9ccould be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d 541 U. S., at 668.  We said nothing, however, of whether such a view would be correct under the law.  Cf. <em>Renico</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ____, n.\xc2\xa03 (2010) (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa03) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hether the [state court] was right or wrong is not the pertinent question under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the contrary, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion explained that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s age may indeed \xe2\x80\x9cbe relevant to the \xe2\x80\x98custody\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 669.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reviewing the question <em>de novo </em>today, we hold that so long as the child\xe2\x80\x99s age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This is not to say that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case.  Cf. <em>ibid.</em> (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (explaining that a state-court decision omitting any mention of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age was not unreasonable under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review where the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas almost 18 years old at the time of his interview\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>post</em>, at 17 (suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9cteenagers nearing the age of majority\xe2\x80\x9d are likely to react to an interrogation as would a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical 18-year-old\nin similar circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is, however, a reality that courts cannot simply ignore.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State and its <em>amici</em> offer numerous reasons that courts must blind themselves to a juvenile defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age.  None is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To start, the State contends that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age must be excluded from the custody inquiry because age is a personal characteristic specific to the suspect himself rather than an \xe2\x80\x9cexternal\xe2\x80\x9d circumstance of the interrogation.  Brief for Respondent 21; see also <em>id.</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cobjective facts related to the interrogation itself\xe2\x80\x9d such as the location and duration of the interrogation).  Despite the supposed significance of this distinction, however, at oral argument counsel for the State suggested without hesitation that at least some undeniably personal characteristics\xe2\x80\x94for instance, whether the individual being questioned is blind\xe2\x80\x94are circumstances relevant to the custody analysis.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Thus, the State\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel cannot be that age is a personal characteristic, without more.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State further argues that age is irrelevant to the custody analysis because it \xe2\x80\x9cgo[es] to how a suspect may internalize and perceive the circumstances of an interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 12; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>21 (hereinafter U. S. Brief) (arguing that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age has no place in the custody analysis because it goes to whether a suspect is \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly susceptible\xe2\x80\x9d to the external circumstances of the interrogation (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  But the same can be said of every objective circumstance that the State agrees is relevant to the custody analysis: Each circumstance goes to how a reasonable person would \xe2\x80\x9cinternalize and perceive\xe2\x80\x9d every other.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Stansbury</em>, 511 U. S., at 325.  Indeed, this is the very reason that we ask whether the objective circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cadd up to custody,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Keohane</em>, 516 U. S., at 113, instead of evaluating the circumstances one by one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the same vein, the State and its <em>amici</em> protest that the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect of \xe2\x80\xa6 age on [the] perception of custody is internal,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 20, or \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Brief<em> </em>21.  But the whole point of the custody analysis is to determine whether, given the circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was \xe2\x80\xa6 at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Keohane</em>, 516 U. S., at 112.  Because the <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry turns on the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s position, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is subjective simply because it has an \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological\xe2\x80\x9d impact on perception.  Were that so, there would be no objective circumstances to consider at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a \xe2\x80\x9cone-size-fits-all reasonable-person test\xe2\x80\x9d applies.  <em>Post</em>, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendant\xe2\x80\x99s age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a child\xe2\x80\x99s age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a child\xe2\x80\x99s age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the \xe2\x80\x9creflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see <em>post</em>, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a child\xe2\x80\x99s age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the State\xe2\x80\x99s plea for clarity and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial \xe2\x80\x9cbrighter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.  <em>Berkemer</em>, 468 U. S., at 441; see <em>ibid.</em> (acknowledging the \xe2\x80\x9coccasiona[l] \xe2\x80\xa6 difficulty\xe2\x80\x9d police officers confront in determining when a suspect has been taken into custody).  But\nwe have rejected that \xe2\x80\x9cmore easily administered line,\xe2\x80\x9d recognizing that it would simply \xe2\x80\x9cenable the police to circumvent the constraints on custodial interrogations established by <em>Miranda</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>ibid.,</em> n. 33.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a child\xe2\x80\x99s youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a child\xe2\x80\x99s age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s inculpatory statements at trial.  See <em>Gallegos</em>, 370 U. S., at 53\xe2\x80\x9355; <em>Haley</em>, 332 U.

But <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Dickerson</em>, 530 U.

To hold, as the State requests, that a child\xe2\x80\x99s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody\xe2\x80\x94and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults\xe2\x80\x94would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that <em>Miranda</em> guarantees to adults.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question remains whether J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B. was in custody when police interrogated him.

It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the <em>Miranda[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</em> rule: the perceived need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.  And today\xe2\x80\x99s holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-\nvoluntary confessions, the <em>Miranda</em> Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspect\xe2\x80\x99s actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s principal strengths\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe ease and clarity of its application\xe2\x80\x9d by law enforcement officials and courts.  See <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 425\xe2\x80\x93426 (1986).  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, <em>Miranda</em> warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for <em>Miranda</em> warnings at all.  And for other suspects\xe2\x80\x94those who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning\xe2\x80\x94<em>Miranda</em> warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against <em>actual </em>coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision shifts the <em>Miranda</em> custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristic\xe2\x80\x94age\xe2\x80\x94that is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit today\xe2\x80\x99s decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s age from other personal characteristics\xe2\x80\x94such as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcement\xe2\x80\x94that may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the <em>Miranda </em>custody test\xe2\x80\x94from a clear, easily applied prophylactic\nrule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the <em>Miranda</em> Court found to be unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all <em>Miranda</em> custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the <em>Miranda</em> custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The <em>Miranda</em> custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of <em>Miranda</em> that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision may portend.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the days before <em>Miranda</em>, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s sole metric for evaluating the admissibility of confessions was a voluntariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <em>Bram</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/168/532/index.html">168 U.

Personal characteristics of suspects have consistently been rejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person standard. <em>Stansbury,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 323 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ustody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, in <em>Berkemer </em>v.<em> McCarty, supra</em>, police officers conducting a traffic stop questioned a man who had been drinking and smoking marijuana before he was pulled over.  <em>Id.,</em> at 423.  Although the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s inebriation was readily apparent to the officers at the scene, <em>ibid.</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis did not advert to this or any other individualized consideration.  Instead, the Court focused only on the external circumstances of the interrogation itself.  The opinion concluded that a typical \xe2\x80\x9ctraffic stop\xe2\x80\x9d is akin to a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Terry </em>stop\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and does not qualify as the equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cformal arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 439.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>California</em> v. <em>Beheler</em>, <em>supra</em>, is another useful example.  There, the circumstances of the interrogation were \xe2\x80\x9cremarkably similar\xe2\x80\x9d to the facts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier decision in <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Mathiason</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/492/index.html"></a><a href="/us/429/492/index.html">429 U.

S., at 1123, 1121.  A California court in <em>Beheler</em> had nonetheless distinguished <em>Mathiason</em> because the police knew that Beheler \xe2\x80\x9chad been drinking earlier in the day\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9cemotionally distraught.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 1124\xe2\x80\x931125.  In a summary reversal, this Court explained that the fact \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat the police knew more\xe2\x80\x9d personal information about Beheler than they did about Mathiason was \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1125.  Neither one of them was in custody under the objective reasonable-person standard.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> see also <em>Alvarado</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 668, 669 (experience with law enforcement irrelevant to <em>Miranda</em> custody analysis \xe2\x80\x9cas a <em>de novo</em> matter\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central premise.  The <em>Miranda</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to adopt its inflexible prophylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U.

And since <em>Miranda</em> is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a constitutional command,\xe2\x80\x9d it is up to the Court \xe2\x80\x9cto justify its expansion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Roberson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/675/index.html">486 U.

This the Court fails to do.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its present form, <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prophylactic regime already imposes \xe2\x80\x9chigh cost[s]\xe2\x80\x9d by requiring suppression of confessions that are often \xe2\x80\x9chighly probative\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d by any traditional standard.  <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

Nonetheless, a \xe2\x80\x9ccore virtue\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Miranda</em> has been the clarity and precision of its guidance to \xe2\x80\x9cpolice and courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/680/index.html">507 U.

This increased clarity \xe2\x80\x9chas been thought to outweigh the burdens\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Miranda</em> imposes.  <em>Fare</em>, 442 U. S., at 718.  The Court has, however, repeatedly cautioned against upsetting the careful \xe2\x80\x9cbalance\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Miranda</em> struck, <em>Moran,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 424, and it has \xe2\x80\x9crefused to sanction attempts to expand [the] <em>Miranda </em>holding\xe2\x80\x9d in ways that would reduce its \xe2\x80\x9cclarity.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Quarles</em>, 467 U.

See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Patane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/630/index.html">542 U. S. 630</a>, 640 (2004) (plurality opinion).  In my judgment, that presumption cannot be overcome here.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity to exercise mature judgment\xe2\x80\x9d and that failing to account for that \xe2\x80\x9creality\xe2\x80\x9d will leave some minors unprotected under <em>Miranda </em>in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-<em>Miranda </em>cases were particularly attuned to this \xe2\x80\x9creality\xe2\x80\x9d in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  <em>Ante,</em> at 9 (relying on <em>Haley, </em>332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and <em>Gallegos</em>, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a \xe2\x80\x9creality,\xe2\x80\x9d however, that many persons <em>over</em> the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See <em>Payne,</em> 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a \xe2\x80\x9cmentally dull 19-year-old youth\xe2\x80\x9d relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the <em>Miranda </em>custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, it has always been the case under <em>Miranda</em> that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  <em>Berkemer</em>, 468 U. S., at 442, and n.\xc2\xa035 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s position would have understood his situation\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s protections.  Compare <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 471\xe2\x80\x93472 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o amount of circumstantial evidence that the person may have been aware of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d his rights can overcome <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements), with <em>Orozco</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/324/index.html">394 U. S. 324</a>, 329 (1969) (White, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar\xe2\x80\x9d).  And <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for \xe2\x80\x9cfrailties,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cidiosyncrasies,\xe2\x80\x9d and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccode of rules for confessions.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <em>Fare,</em> 439 U. S., at 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he rigidity of [<em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s] prophylactic rules was a principal weakness in the view of dissenters and critics outside the Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  But if it is, then the weakness is an inescapable consequence of the <em>Miranda</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to supplement the more holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size-fits-all prophylactic rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is undoubtedly why this Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda </em>cases have never before mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cthe suspect\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x9d or any other individualized consideration in applying the custody standard.  See <em>Alvarado</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 666.  And unless the<em> Miranda</em> custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why, for example, is age different from intelligence?  Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to question a student, is told by the principal that the student has an I.\xc2\xa0Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class.  Cf. <em>In re J.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0B.</em>, 363 N.\xc2\xa0C. 664, 666, 686 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 135, 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (2009).  Are those facts more or less important than the student\xe2\x80\x99s age in determining whether he or she \xe2\x80\x9cfelt \xe2\x80\xa6 at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave\xe2\x80\x9d?  See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/99/index.html">516 U. S. 99</a>, 112 (1995).

S., at 718 (noting that the clarity of <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirements \xe2\x80\x9chas been thought to outweigh the burdens that the decision . . . imposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  However, even today\xe2\x80\x99s more limited departure from <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test will produce the very consequences that prompted the <em>Miranda</em> Court to abandon exclusive reliance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The Court\xe2\x80\x99s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will be hard for judges to apply.  See <em>Dickerson </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 444 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it \xe2\x80\x9cwas known to the officer at the time of the interview,\xe2\x80\x9d or when it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been objectively apparent\xe2\x80\x9d to a reasonable officer.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial determination of custody\xe2\x80\x9d does not depend on the \xe2\x80\x9csubjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stansbury,</em> 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officer\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s I.\xc2\xa0D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both \xe2\x80\x9ctime-consuming and disruptive\xe2\x80\x9d for the police and the courts.  See <em>Berkemer</em>, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to these difficulties is to state that \xe2\x80\x9cno imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science\xe2\x80\x9d will be necessary.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  Judges \xe2\x80\x9csimply need the common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court assures, \xe2\x80\x9cto know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rule demands much more than this.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Take a fairly typical case in which today\xe2\x80\x99s holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.  In particular, the Court relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in negligence suits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third) of Torts \xc2\xa710, Comment <em>b</em>, p.\xc2\xa0117 (2005)).  But negligence is generally a question for the jury, the members of which can draw on their varied experiences with persons of different ages.  It also involves a <em>post hoc</em> determination, in the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about whether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.  The <em>Miranda</em> custody determination, by contrast, must be made in the first instance by police officers in the course of an investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.  See <em>Quarles</em>, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe importance\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Miranda </em>of providing \xe2\x80\x9ca workable rule \xe2\x80\x98to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Alvarado</em>, 541 U.

Those decisions involve the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial exercise of independent judgment\xe2\x80\x9d about the constitutionality of certain punishments.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 16).  Like the negligence standard, they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the police.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do state laws affording extra protection for juveniles during custodial interrogation provide any support for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments.  See Brief for Petitioner 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  States are free to enact additional restrictions on the police over and above those demanded by the Constitution or <em>Miranda</em>.  In addition, these state statutes generally create clear, workable rules to guide police conduct.  See Brief for Petitioner 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (citing statutes that require or permit parents to be present during custodial interrogation of a minor, that require minors to be advised of a statutory right to communicate with a parent or guardian, and that require parental consent to custodial interrogation).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, by contrast, injects a new, complicating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied prophylactic rule.  See <em>Alvarado</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 668\xe2\x80\x93669.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and administrability that have long been recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal advantages\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prophylactic requirements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Moran,</em> 475 U. S., at 425.  But what is worse, the Court takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other, less disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are not coerced into confessing.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard introduces will likely yield little added protection for most juvenile defendants.  Most juveniles who are subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the age of majority.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  These defendants\xe2\x80\x99 reactions to police pressure are unlikely to be much different from the reaction of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances.  A one-size-fits-all <em>Miranda</em> custody rule thus provides a roughly reasonable fit for these defendants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the <em>Miranda</em> custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The<em> Miranda</em> custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of movement, and the presence of police officers or other authority figures.  See <em>Alvarado</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 665; <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Shatzer</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14).  It can do so here as well.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see <em>Schneckloth,</em> 412 U. S., at 224, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents already make clear that \xe2\x80\x9cspecial care\xe2\x80\x9d must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a \xe2\x80\x9cmere child\xe2\x80\x9d is at issue.  <em>Haley, </em>332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion).  If <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the unique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigorously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to ensure that the rights of minors are protected.  There is no need to run <em>Miranda</em> off the rails.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court rests its decision to inject personal characteristics into the <em>Miranda</em> custody inquiry on the principle that judges applying <em>Miranda</em> cannot \xe2\x80\x9cblind themselves to \xe2\x80\xa6 commonsense reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1, 8, 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 14.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s shift is fundamentally at odds with the clear prophylactic rules that <em>Miranda</em> has long enforced.  <em>Miranda</em> frequently requires judges to blind themselves to the reality that many un-Mirandized custodial confessions are \xe2\x80\x9cby no means involuntary\xe2\x80\x9d or coerced.  <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U. S., at 444.  It also requires police to provide a rote recitation of <em>Miranda </em>warnings that many suspects already know and could likely recite from memory.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Under today\xe2\x80\x99s new, \xe2\x80\x9creality\xe2\x80\x9d-based approach to the doctrine, perhaps these and other principles of our <em>Miranda</em> jurisprudence will, like the custody standard, now be ripe for modification.  Then, bit by bit, <em>Miranda </em>will lose the clarity and ease of application that has long been viewed as one of its chief justifications.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.
