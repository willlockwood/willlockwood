S. 542</a></p><p> taxation.  It proposes to advocate its point of view before Congress, the Executive Branch, and the Judiciary.  This case began when TWR applied for tax-exempt status under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3).  The Internal Revenue Service denied the application because it appeared that a substantial part of TWR\'s activities would consist of attempting to influence legislation, which is not permitted by \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>TWR then brought this suit in District Court against the appellants, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States, seeking a declaratory judgment that it qualifies for the exemption granted by \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3).  It claimed the prohibition against substantial lobbying is unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment\'s Due Process Clause. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The District Court granted summary judgment for appellants.  On appeal, the en banc Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) does not violate the First Amendment but does violate the Fifth Amendment.  219 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 676 F.2d 715 (1982).  Appellants appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1252, and TWR cross-appealed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 461 U. S. 543</a></p><p> We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal, 459 U.S. 819 (1982). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>TWR was formed to take over the operations of two other nonprofit corporations.  One, Taxation With Representation Fund, was organized to promote TWR\'s goals by publishing a journal and engaging in litigation; it had tax-exempt status under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3).  The other, Taxation With Representation, attempted to promote the same goals by influencing legislation; it had tax-exempt status under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Neither predecessor organization was required to pay federal income taxes.  For purposes of our analysis, there are two principal differences between \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations and \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) organizations.  Taxpayers who contribute to \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations are permitted by \xc2\xa7 170(c)(2) to deduct the amount of their contributions on their federal income tax returns, while contributions to \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) organizations are not deductible.  Section 501(c)(4) organizations, but not \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations, are permitted to engage in substantial lobbying to advance their exempt purposes.</p>\n<p>In these cases, TWR is attacking the prohibition against substantial lobbying in \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) because it wants to use tax </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 461 U. S. 544</a></p><p> deductible contributions to support substantial lobbying activities.  To evaluate TWR\'s claims, it is necessary to understand the effect of the tax exemption system enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p>Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system.  A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.  Deductible contributions are similar to cash grants of the amount of a portion of the individual\'s contributions. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The system Congress has enacted provides this kind of subsidy to nonprofit civic welfare organizations generally, and an additional subsidy to those charitable organizations that do not engage in substantial lobbying.  In short, Congress chose not to subsidize lobbying as extensively as it chose to subsidize other activities that nonprofit organizations undertake to promote the public welfare.</p>\n<p>It appears that TWR could still qualify for a tax exemption under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4).  It also appears that TWR can obtain tax-deductible contributions for its nonlobbying activity by returning to the dual structure it used in the past, with a \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organization for nonlobbying activities and a \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) organization for lobbying.  TWR would, of course, have to ensure that the \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organization did not subsidize the \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) organization; otherwise, public funds might be spent on an activity Congress chose not to subsidize. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 461 U. S. 545</a></p><p></p>\n<p>TWR contends that Congress\' decision not to subsidize its lobbying violates the First Amendment.  It claims, relying on <em>Speiser v. Randall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html">357 U. S. 513</a></span> (1958), that the prohibition against substantial lobbying by \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations imposes an "unconstitutional condition" on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions.  In <em>Speiser,</em> California established a rule requiring anyone who sought to take advantage of a property tax exemption to sign a declaration stating that he did not advocate the forcible overthrow of the Government of the United States.  This Court stated that "[t]o deny an exemption to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html#518">357 U. S. 518</a></span>.</p>\n<p>TWR is certainly correct when it states that we have held that the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.  <em>See Perry v. Sindermann,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/593/case.html">408 U. S. 593</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/593/case.html#597">408 U. S. 597</a></span> (1972).  But TWR is just as certainly incorrect when it claims that this case fits the <em>Speiser-Perry</em> model.  The Code does not deny TWR the right to receive deductible contributions to support its nonlobbying activity, nor does it deny TWR any independent benefit on account of its intention to lobby.  Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys.  This Court has never held that Congress must grant a benefit such as TWR claims here to a person who wishes to exercise a constitutional right. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 461 U. S. 546</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This aspect of these cases is controlled by <em>Cammarano v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/498/case.html">358 U. S. 498</a></span> (1959), in which we upheld a Treasury Regulation that denied business expense deductions for lobbying activities.  We held that Congress is not required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/498/case.html#513">358 U. S. 513</a></span>.  In these cases, as in <em>Cammarano,</em> Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights or regulated any First Amendment activity.  Congress has simply chosen not to pay for TWR\'s lobbying.  We again reject the "notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/498/case.html#515">358 U. S. 515</a></span> (Douglas, J., concurring). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>TWR also contends that the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment renders the prohibition against substantial lobbying invalid.  TWR points out that \xc2\xa7 170(c)(3) permits taxpayers to deduct contributions to veterans\' organizations that qualify for tax exemption under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(19).  Qualifying veterans\' organizations are permitted to lobby as much as they want in furtherance of their exempt purposes. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 461 U. S. 547</a></p><p> TWR argues that, because Congress has chosen to subsidize the substantial lobbying activities of veterans\' organizations, it must also subsidize the lobbying of \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations.</p>\n<p>Generally, statutory classifications are valid if they bear a rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  Statutes are subjected to a higher level of scrutiny if they interfere with the exercise of a fundamental right, such as freedom of speech, or employ a suspect classification, such as race.  <em>E.g., Harris v. McRae,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/297/case.html">448 U. S. 297</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/297/case.html#322">448 U. S. 322</a></span> (1980).  Legislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax statutes.  More than 40 years ago, we addressed these comments to an equal protection challenge to tax legislation:</p>\n<p>"The broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legislature in the field of taxation has long been recognized. . . .  [T]he passage of time has only served to underscore the wisdom of that recognition of the large area of discretion which is needed by a legislature in formulating sound tax policies.  Traditionally, classification has been a device for fitting tax programs to local needs and usages in order to achieve an equitable distribution of the tax burden.  It has, because of this, been pointed out that, in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.  Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which this Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.  The burden is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 461 U. S. 548</a></p><p> on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it."</p>\n<p><em>Madden v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/83/case.html">309 U. S. 83</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/83/case.html#87">309 U.

S. 359</a></span>-360 (1973).</p>\n<p>We have already explained why we conclude that Congress has not violated TWR\'s First Amendment rights by declining to subsidize its First Amendment activities.  The case would be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to "\'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas.\'"  <em>Cammarano, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/498/case.html#513">358 U. S. 513</a></span>, quoting <em>Speiser,</em> 357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/513/case.html#519">357 U. S. 519</a></span>.  But the veterans\' organizations that qualify under \xc2\xa7 501(c)(19) are entitled to receive tax-deductible contributions regardless of the content of any speech they may use, including lobbying.  We find no indication that the statute was intended to suppress any ideas, or any demonstration that it has had that effect.  The sections of the Internal Revenue Code here at issue do not employ any suspect classification.  The distinction between veterans\' organizations and other charitable organizations is not at all like distinctions based on race or national origin.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that "strict scrutiny" is required because the statute "<em>affect[s]</em> First Amendment rights on a discriminatory basis."  219 U.S.App.D.C. at 130, 676 F.2d at 728 (emphasis supplied).  Its opinion suggests that strict scrutiny applies whenever Congress subsidizes some speech, but not all speech.  This is not the law.  Congress could, for example, grant funds to an organization dedicated to combating teenage drug abuse, but condition the grant by providing that none of the money received from Congress should be used to lobby state legislatures.  Under <em>Cammarano,</em> such a statute would be valid.  Congress might also enact a statute providing public money </p><p><a class="page-number" name="549">Page 461 U. S. 549</a></p><p> for an organization dedicated to combating teenage alcohol abuse, and impose no condition against using funds obtained from Congress for lobbying.  The existence of the second statute would not make the first statute subject to strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for entitlement to this sort of largesse</p>\n<p>"is obviously a matter of policy and discretion not open to judicial review unless in circumstances which here we are not able to find.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/163/427/case.html">United States v.

We have held in several contexts that a legislature\'s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny.  <em>Buckley v. Valeo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html">424 U.

We declined to apply strict scrutiny, and rejected equal protection challenges to the statutes.</p>\n<p>The reasoning of these decisions is simple:</p>\n<p>"although government may not place obstacles in the path of a [person\'s] exercise of . . . freedom of [speech], it need not remove those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 461 U.

TWR contends that \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations could better advance their charitable purposes if they were permitted to engage in substantial lobbying.  This may well be true.  But Congress -- not TWR or this Court -- has the authority to determine whether the advantage the public would receive from additional lobbying by charities is worth the money the public would pay to subsidize that lobbying, and other disadvantages that might accompany that lobbying.  It appears that Congress was concerned that exempt organizations might use tax-deductible contributions to lobby to promote the private interests of their members.  <em>See</em> 78 Cong.Rec. 5861 (1934) (remarks of Sen. Reed); <em>id.</em> at 5959 (remarks of Sen. La Follette).  It is not irrational for Congress to decide that tax-exempt charities such as TWR should not further benefit at the expense of taxpayers at large by obtaining a further subsidy for lobbying.</p>\n<p>It is also not irrational for Congress to decide that, even though it will not subsidize substantial lobbying by charities generally, it will subsidize lobbying by veterans\' organizations.

No such requirement in the Code or regulations has been called to our attention, nor have we been able to discover one.  The IRS apparently requires only that the two groups be separately incorporated and keep records adequate to show that tax-deductible contributions are not used to pay for lobbying.  This is not unduly burdensome.</p>\n<p>We also note that TWR did not bring this suit because it was unable to operate with the dual structure and seeks a less stringent set of bookkeeping requirements.  Rather, TWR seeks to force Congress to subsidize its lobbying activity.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v.

In that case, the challenged ordinance regulated First Amendment activity by limiting individuals\' expenditures of their own money on political speech.</p>\n<p>TWR contends that Congress has overruled <em>Cammarano</em> by enacting \xc2\xa7 162(e), which permits businesses to deduct certain lobbying expenses that are "ordinary and necessary [business] expenses."  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellee 13.  It is elementary that Congress\' decision to permit deductions does not affect this Court\'s holding that refusing to permit them does not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The rules governing deductibility of contributions to veterans\' organizations are not the same as the analogous rules for \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations.  For example, an individual may generally deduct up to 50% of his adjusted gross income in contributions to \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations, but only 20% in contributions to veterans\' organizations.  <em>Compare</em> \xc2\xa7 170(b)(1)(A) <em>with</em> \xc2\xa7 170(b)(1)(B).  Taxpayers are permitted to carry over excess contributions to \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations, but not veterans\' organizations, to the next year.  \xc2\xa7 170(d).  There are other differences.  If it were entitled to equal treatment with veterans\' organizations, TWR would, of course, be entitled only to the benefits they receive, not to more.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., Personnel Administrator of Mass. v.

Because 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 501\'s discrimination between veterans\' organizations and charitable organizations is not based on the content of their speech, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html#548">461 U. S. 548</a></span>, I agree with the Court that \xc2\xa7 501 does not deny charitable organizations equal protection of the law.  The benefit provided to veterans\' organizations is rationally based on the Nation\'s time-honored policy of "compensating veterans for their past contributions."  <em>Ante</em> this page.  As the Court says, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html#548">461 U.

I write separately to make clear that, in my view, the result under the First Amendment depends entirely upon the Court\'s necessary assumption -- which I share -- about the manner in which the Internal Revenue Service administers \xc2\xa7 501.</p>\n<p>If viewed in isolation, the lobbying restriction contained in \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) violates the principle, reaffirmed today, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html#545">461 U.

Section 501(c)(3) does not merely deny a subsidy for lobbying activities, <em>see Cammarano v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/498/case.html">358 U. S. 498</a></span> (1959); it deprives an otherwise eligible organization of its tax-exempt status and its eligibility to receive tax-deductible contributions for all its activities, whenever one of those activities is "substantial lobbying."  Because lobbying is protected by the First Amendment, <em>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v.

As long as the IRS goes no further than this, we perhaps can safely say that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Code does not deny TWR the right to receive deductible contributions to support its nonlobbying activity, nor does it deny TWR any independent benefit on account of its intention to lobby."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html#545">461 U.

A \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organization\'s right to speak is not infringed, because it is free to make known its views on legislation through its \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) affiliate without losing tax benefits for its nonlobbying activities.</p>\n<p>Any significant restriction on this channel of communication, however, would negate the saving effect of \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4).  It must be remembered that \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations retain their constitutional right to speak and to petition the Government.  Should the IRS attempt to limit the control these organizations exercise over the lobbying of their \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) affiliates, the First Amendment problems would be insurmountable.  It hardly answers one person\'s objection to a restriction on his speech that another person, outside his control, may speak for him.  Similarly, an attempt to prevent \xc2\xa7 501(c)(4) organizations from lobbying explicitly on behalf of their \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) affiliates would perpetuate \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3) organizations\' inability to make known their views on legislation without incurring the unconstitutional penalty.  Such restrictions would extend far beyond Congress\' mere refusal to subsidize lobbying.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html#544">461 U.
