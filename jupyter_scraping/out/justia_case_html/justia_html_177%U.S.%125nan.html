After its organization, it surveyed a line of route for its railroad from a point near Jamestown in a northwesterly direction through the County of Stutsman and over the land in controversy.  The survey was finished the 30th of October, 1881.  A map representing the survey was made by a resolution of the board of directors, and was adopted as the definite route of the railroad.</p>\n<p>In 1882, the road was constructed upon the line surveyed, and since that time trains have been continuously run over it by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>On the 26th of January, 1883, the plaintiff filed with the Secretary of the Interior a copy of its articles of incorporation, and due proofs of its organization under the same.

On that day, intending to purchase said tract under the preemption laws, he built a house thereon; on the 3d day of March of said year, he commenced living in said house, and from that day continuously to the present has resided on said land and has cultivated and improved the same.  On June 5, 1883, he filed in said land office at Fargo a declaratory statement under the preemption law, alleging settlement on said land on March 3, 1883.  He afterward applied to said land office to be allowed to make proof under his declaratory statement, but owing to the existence of said prior homestead entry of Ella Sharp, said application was refused.  In November, 1892, he secured from said Ella Sharp a relinquishment of her homestead entry, and on the 21st day of November, 1892, the same date said entry was cancelled by relinquishment, he made application to said land office to be allowed to change his preemption entry upon said tract into a homestead entry.  Said application was received at said land office, the entry allowed and numbered 20,234, and a receiver\'s receipt bearing the same number issued to said defendant.

On the 26th day of May, 1893, a patent in due form, whereby the United States conveyed and granted said land to said defendant, was issued to and received by him.  There was not in said receiver\'s receipt or final certificate, or in said patent for said tract a reservation of any vested or accrued right, claim, or interest to said land on the part of the plaintiff or of any person or corporation under the act of Congress of March 3, 1875.

S. 129</a></p><p> United States is hereby granted to any railway company duly organized under the laws of any state or territory, except the District of Columbia, or by the Congress of the United States, which shall have filed with the Secretary of the Interior a copy of its articles of incorporation, and due proof of its organization under the same, to the extent of one hundred feet on each side of the central line of said road;"</p>\n<p>"Also the right to take from the public lands adjacent to the line of said road, material, earth, stone, and timber necessary for the construction of said railroad;"</p>\n<p>"Also ground adjacent to such right of way for station buildings, depots, machine shops, side tracks, turnouts, and water stations, not to exceed in amount twenty acres for each station, to the extent of one station for each ten miles of its road."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"SEC. 3.  That the legislature of the proper territory may provide for the manner in which private lands and possessory claims on the public lands may be condemned, and where such provision shall not have been made, such condemnation may be made in accordance with section 3 of the act entitled"</p>\n<p>"An Act to Aid in the Construction of a Railroad and Telegraph Line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to Secure to the government the Use of the Same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes, Approved July 1, 1862,"</p>\n<p>"approved July 1, 1864."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 4.  That any railroad company desiring to secure the benefits of this act shall, within twelve months after the location of any section of twenty miles of its road, if the same be upon surveyed lands, and if upon unsurveyed lands, within twelve months after the survey thereof by the United States, file with the register of the land office for the district where such land is located a profile of its road, and upon approval thereof by the Secretary of the Interior the same shall be noted upon the plats in said office, and thereafter all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way:  <em>Provided,</em> That if any section of said road shall not be completed within five years after the location </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 177 U. S. 130</a></p><p> of said section, the rights herein granted shall be forfeited as to any such uncompleted section of said road."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 5.  That this act shall not apply to any lands within the limits of any military park or Indian reservation, or other lands especially reserved for sale. . . ."</p>\n<p>There is some uncertainty in the act.  Its first section is expressed in words of present grant, but there is no definite grantee.  We said in <em>Hall v. Russell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/503/case.html#509">101 U. S. 509</a></span>:  "There cannot be a grant unless there is a grantee, and consequently there cannot be a present grant unless there is a present grantee."  And it was further said that in all cases where a grant was given a present effect, a state or some other corporation having all of the qualifications specified in the act had been designated as a grantee.  In other words, when an immediate grant was intended, an immediate grantee having all the requisite qualifications was named.  In <em>Noble v. Railroad Co.,</em>  we said:</p>\n<p>"The language of that section is \'that the right of way through the public lands of the United States is hereby granted to any railroad company duly organized under the laws of any state or territory,\' etc.  The uniform rule of this Court has been that such an act was a grant <em>in praesenti</em> of lands to be thereafter identified.  <em>Railway Co. v. Alling,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/99/463/case.html">99 U. S. 463</a></span>."</p>\n<p>This case establishes that a railroad company becomes specifically a grantee by filing its articles of incorporation and due proofs of its organization under the same with the Secretary of the Interior.  It was also so held by Mr. Secretary Vilas in Dakota Central Railroad Co. v. Downey, 8 L.D. 115.</p>\n<p>But what constitutes a definite location of the right of way?  Upon the answer to that question the present controversy hinges.  The state courts decided, as we have seen, that the right of way only became definitely located by the filing of a profile map of the road.  The contention of the plaintiff in error is that the right of way may be definitely located by the actual construction of the road.  And this was the ruling of the Interior Department in Dakota v. Downey, <em>supra,</em> and the ruling has been subsequently adhered to.  St. Paul, Minneapolis </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 177 U. S. 131</a></p><p> &amp; Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Maloney, 24 L.D. 460; Montana Central R. Co., 25 L.D. 250; St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis Ry. Co., 26 L.D. 83;</p>\n<p>The ruling gives a practical operation to the statute, and we think is correct.  It enables the railroad company to secure the grant by an actual construction of its road, or in advance of construction by filing a map as provided in section four.  Actual construction of the road is certainly unmistakable evidence and notice of appropriation.</p>\n<p>Secretary Vilas said in Dakota Central R. Co. v. Downey:</p>\n<p>"As to the roadway the construction of the road fixes the boundaries of the grant, and fixes it by the exact rule of the statute. . . .  This must undoubtedly be the rule when the road is constructed over unsurveyed lands, because then every condition necessary to the vigor of the present grant in complied with.  The fact that the railroad company may locate and construct its road upon unsurveyed lands is clearly recognized in the fourth section of the act, and the regulations of the department have been made to apply to such cases, and authorize such construction."</p>\n<p>"It seems to me that the fourth section of the act was written for another purpose and for another case.  It relates to a case of a railroad company which desires to secure the present grant, and give to it fixity of location, <em>before</em> its road shall be constructed, and it is designed to provide a similar privilege in respect to rights of way which acts granting lands to aid in the construction of railroads have provided -- namely, the privilege of giving fixity of location to the subject of the grant <em>before</em> construction of the road."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"It does not become necessary for a road which has secured the benefits of this act by taking the steps which give it the attitude of being named in the first section as a grantee, and by building a road through the public lands, whereby the subject of the grant has been defined, to file a map of definite location in order to entitle it to the benefits of the right of way."</p>\n<p>"The fourth section is designed to provide a mode by which fixity of location can be secured to a grantee, <em>in anticipation</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 177 U. S. 132</a></p><p> of that construction by which location is defined in the section making the grant, and which shall have the effect, before the construction of the road, which the terms of the grant limit to the \'central line of said road,\' which only means-without the 4th section -- a <em>constructed</em> road."</p>\n<p>This decision and the subsequent decisions of the Interior Department were concerned with cases of construction on unsurveyed land, but we think the power applies also to surveyed lands.  The only difference which the act of Congress makes between surveyed and unsurveyed land is the provision in section four for filing the profile of the road.</p>\n<p>It follows from these views that the grant to plaintiff in error by the act of 1875 became definitely fixed by the actual construction of its road, and that the entry of the defendant in error was subject thereto.</p>\n<p>This conclusion does not conflict with the doctrine announced in <em>Van Wyck v. Knevals,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/360/case.html">106 U. S. 360</a></span>, and in <em>Kansas Pacific Railway Co. v. Dunmeyer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/113/629/case.html">113 U. S. 629</a></span>, that the title to lands passing under railroad land grants is considered as established at the date of the filing of the map of definite location.  The same question is not here presented.  Different considerations apply to the grant of lands than to the grant of the right of way.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
