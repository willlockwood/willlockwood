Both Acts shield whistleblowers from retaliation, but they differ in important respects.  Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d who report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal supervisor.\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71514A(a)(1).  Dodd-Frank defines a \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany individual who provides .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or regulation, by the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6).  A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award if original information provided to the SEC leads to a successful enforcement action.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(b)\xe2\x80\x93(g).  And he or she is protected from retaliation in three situations, see \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii), including for \xe2\x80\x9cmaking disclosures that are required or protected under\xe2\x80\x9d Sarbanes-Oxley or other specified laws, \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A)(iii).  Sarbanes-Oxley\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement and a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), whereas Dodd-Frank permits a whistleblower to sue an employer directly in federal district court, with a default six-year limitation period, see \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The SEC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank provision contain two discrete whistleblower definitions.  For purposes of the award program, Rule 21F\xe2\x80\x932 requires a whistleblower to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the Commission<i> </i>with information\xe2\x80\x9d relating to possible securities-law violations.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.21F\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections, however, the Rule does not require SEC reporting.  See \xc2\xa7240.21F\xe2\x80\x932(b)(1)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondent Paul Somers alleges that petitioner Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) terminated his employment shortly after he reported to senior management suspected securities-law violations by the company.  Somers filed suit, alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, a claim of whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank.  Digital Realty moved to dismiss that claim on the ground that Somers was not a whistleblower under \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h) because he did not alert the SEC prior to his termination.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h) does not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d status, and it accorded deference to the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation under <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision does not extend to an individual, like Somers, who has not reported a violation of the securities laws to the SEC.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0A statute\xe2\x80\x99s explicit definition must be followed, even if it varies from a term\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning.  <i>Burgess</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124\n.  Section 78u\xe2\x80\x936(a) instructs that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n this section,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, throughout \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936.  The Court must therefore interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h), the anti-retaliation provision, in accordance with that definition.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction with the three clauses of \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A) to spell out the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The definition first describes <i>who </i>is eligible for protection\xe2\x80\x94namely, a \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d who provides pertinent information \xe2\x80\x9cto the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6).  The three clauses then describe what <i>conduct</i>, when engaged in by a \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower,\xe2\x80\x9d is shielded from employment discrimination.  An individual who meets both measures may invoke Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s protections.  But an individual who falls outside the protected category of \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblowers\xe2\x80\x9d is ineligible to seek redress under the statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual engages.  This reading is reinforced by another whistleblower-protection provision in Dodd-Frank, see\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75567(b), which imposes no requirement that information be conveyed to a government agency.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding is corroborated by Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and design.  The core objective of Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s whistleblower program is to aid the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement efforts by \xe2\x80\x9cmotivat[ing] people who know of securities law violations to <i>tell the SEC</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 111\xe2\x80\x93176, p.\xc2\xa038 (emphasis added).  To that end, Congress provided monetary awards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable information to the Commission.  Congress also complemented the financial incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection against retaliation.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Somers and the Solicitor General contend that Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d definition applies only to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s award program and not, as the definition plainly states, to its anti-retaliation provision.  Their concerns do not support a departure from the statutory text.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0They claim that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading would vitiate the protections of clause (iii) for whistleblowers who make disclosures to persons and entities other than the SEC.  See \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A)(iii).  But the plain-text reading of the statute leaves the third clause with substantial meaning by protecting a whistleblower who reports misconduct <i>both</i> to the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation because of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Nor would the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading jettison protections for auditors, attorneys, and other employees who are required to report information within the company before making external disclosures.  Such employees would be shielded <i>as soon as they also provide relevant information to the Commission</i>.  And Congress may well have considered adequate the safeguards already afforded to such employees by Sarbanes-Oxley.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Applying the \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d definition as written, Somers and the Solicitor General further protest, will allow \xe2\x80\x9cidentical misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cgo punished or not based on the happenstance of a separate report\xe2\x80\x9d to the SEC.  Brief for Respondent 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  But it is understandable that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation protections, like its financial rewards, would be reserved for employees who have done what Dodd-Frank seeks to achieve by reporting information about unlawful activity to the SEC.  P.\xc2\xa016.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(4)\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General observes that the statute contains no apparent requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal or topical connection between the violation reported to the Commission and the internal disclosure for which the employee suffers retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25.  The Court need not dwell on related hypotheticals, which veer far from the case at hand.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(5)\xc2\xa0Finally, the interpretation adopted here would not undermine clause (ii) of \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A), which prohibits retaliation against a whistleblower for \xe2\x80\x9cinitiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. action of the Commission based upon\xe2\x80\x9d information conveyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.  The statute delegates authority to the Commission to establish the \xe2\x80\x9cmanner\xe2\x80\x9d in which a whistleblower may provide information to the SEC.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6).  Nothing prevents the Commission from enumerating additional means of SEC reporting, including through testimony protected by clause (ii).  P.\xc2\xa018.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0Because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 842, deference is not accorded to the contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule 21F\xe2\x80\x932.

Rule 21F\xe2\x80\x932, in finished form, contains two discrete \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d definitions.  See 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.21F\xe2\x80\x932(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) (2017).

This principle resolves the question before us.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our charge in this review proceeding is to determine the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h), Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision.  The definition section of the statute supplies an unequivocal answer: A \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblower\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cany individual who provides .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information relating to a violation of the securities laws <i>to the Commission</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6) (emphasis added).

The definition first describes <i>who </i>is eligible for protection\xe2\x80\x94namely, a whistleblower who provides pertinent information \xe2\x80\x9cto the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6).  The three clauses of \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A) then describe what <i>conduct</i>, when engaged in by a whistle- blower, is shielded from employment discrimination.  See \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii).  An individual who meets both measures may invoke Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s protections.

Title 10 of the statute, which created the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), prohibits discrimination against a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered employee\xe2\x80\x9d who, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information to [his or her] employer, the Bureau, or any other State, local, or Federal, government authority or law enforcement agency relating to\xe2\x80\x9d a violation of a law subject to the CFPB\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\n\n12 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75567(a)(1).  To qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ccovered employee,\xe2\x80\x9d an individual need not provide information to the CFPB, or any other entity.

The \xe2\x80\x9ccore objective\xe2\x80\x9d of Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s robust whistleblower program, as Somers acknowledges, Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, is \xe2\x80\x9cto motivate people who know of securities law violations to<i> tell the SEC</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

By enlisting whistleblowers to \xe2\x80\x9cassist the Government [in] identify[ing] and prosecut[ing] persons who have violated securities laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress undertook to improve SEC enforcement and facilitate the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crecover[y] [of] money for victims of financial fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 110.  To that end, \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936 provides substantial monetary rewards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable information to the SEC.  See \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Financial inducements alone, Congress recognized, may be insufficient to encourage certain employees, fearful of employer retaliation, to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing.  Congress therefore complemented the Dodd-Frank monetary incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection against retaliation.  While Sarbanes-Oxley contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement, a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, and a remedial scheme limited to actual damages, Dodd-Frank provides for immediate access to federal court, a generous statute of limitations (at least six years), and the opportunity to recover double backpay.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s award program and anti-retaliation provision thus work synchronously to motivate individuals with knowledge of illegal activity to \xe2\x80\x9ctell the SEC.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

In such a case, without clause (iii), retaliation for internal reporting would not be reached by Dodd-Frank, for clause (i) applies only where the employer retaliates against the employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d the SEC reporting.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A).  More- over, even where the employer knows of the SEC reporting, the third clause may operate to dispel a proof problem: The employee can recover under the statute without having to demonstrate whether the retaliation was motivated by the internal report (thus yielding protection under clause (iii)) or by the SEC disclosure (thus gaining protection under clause (i)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the Solicitor General asserts that limiting the protections of clause (iii) to dual reporters would \xe2\x80\x9cshrink to insignificance the [clause\xe2\x80\x99s] ban on retaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 22 (internal quotation marks omitted), he offers scant evidence to support that assertion.

See Brief for Petitioner 33, and n.\xc2\xa04 (collecting cases).  Overlooked by Somers and the Solicitor General, in dual-reporting cases, retaliation not prompted by SEC disclosures (and thus unaddressed by clause (i)) is likely commonplace: The SEC is required to protect the identity of whistleblowers, see \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(2)(A), so employers will often be unaware that an employee has reported to the Commission.  In any event, even if the number of individuals qualifying for protection under clause (iii) is relatively limited, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is our function to give the statute the effect its language suggests, however modest that may be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>National Australia Bank Ltd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247,\n270 (2010)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Somers and the Solicitor General express concern that our reading would jettison protection for auditors, attorneys, and other employees subject to internal-reporting requirements.

We note, however, that the interpretation offered by Somers and the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>ignoring the statutory definition when construing the anti-retaliation provision\xe2\x80\x94raises an even thornier question about the law\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Their view, which would not require an employee to provide information relating to a securities-law violation to the SEC, could afford Dodd-Frank protection to an employee who reports information bearing no relationship whatever to the securities laws.  That prospect could be imagined based on the broad array of federal statutes and regulations cross-referenced by clause (iii) of the anti-retaliation provision.  <i>E.g., </i>\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71513(e) (criminalizing retaliation for \xe2\x80\x9cproviding to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of <i>any Federal offense</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see <i>supra,</i> at 5, and n. 2.  For example, an employee fired for reporting a coworker\xe2\x80\x99s drug dealing to the Federal Bureau of Investigation might be protected.  Brief for Petitioner 38.

Clause (ii) prohibits retaliation against a whistleblower for \xe2\x80\x9cinitiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. action of the Commission based upon\xe2\x80\x9d information conveyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(A)(ii).

Moreover, confirming our construction of a statute by considering reliable legislative history shows respect for and promotes comity with a coequal branch of Government.
