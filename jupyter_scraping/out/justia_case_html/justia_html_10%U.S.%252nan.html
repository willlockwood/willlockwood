The plan of the voyage not having been prosecuted, the complainant wished to get his stock back again, but could not get either the stock or the money from Bacon.  It was, however, finally agreed that Bacon should be considered as answerable for the stock, and should give a mortgage to secure the repayment of the stock and eight percent interest.</p>\n<p>The court below decided the contract to be usurious, and decreed the mortgage to be void.  Which decree this Court, after argument, by Swann, for the appellant, and Youngs, for the appellees,</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
