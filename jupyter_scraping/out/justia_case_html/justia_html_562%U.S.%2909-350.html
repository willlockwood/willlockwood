However, under California law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index), where they would remain available to various state agencies for at least 10 years.  The statute has no procedures for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures.  Respondents filed suit under \xc2\xa71983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a declaration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hearing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.  The court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, including $60,000 from the county.  The county objected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em> caused the deprivation of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s federal right, <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U. S. 658</a><em>,</em> 694; but a <em>state</em> policy caused any deprivation here.  The Ninth Circuit, <em>inter alia, </em>found that respondents did prevail against the county on their claim for declaratory relief because <em>Monell </em>did not apply to prospective relief claims. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0<em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement applies in \xc2\xa71983 cases irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.

S. 167</a><em>, </em>this Court based its holding that municipal entities were not \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71983 on the provision\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, particularly Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of the so-called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities liable for damages done by <em>private </em>persons \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98riotously and tumultuously assembled,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 188\xe2\x80\x93190, and n.\xc2\xa038.  Reexamining this legislative history in <em>Monell</em>, the Court overruled <em>Monroe.  </em>It concluded that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others.  The Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history, went on to explain what acts are the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s own for purposes of liability.  The Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca municipality cannot be held liable\xe2\x80\x9d solely for the acts of others, <em>e.g.,</em> \xe2\x80\x9csolely because it employs a tortfeasor,\xe2\x80\x9d 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable \xe2\x80\x9cwhen execution of a government\xe2\x80\x99s policy or custom \xe2\x80\xa6 inflicts the injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 694.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 1983, read in light of <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the legislative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall within the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>requirement.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71983 suggests that the causation requirement should change with the form of relief sought.  In fact, the text suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x99s elements \xe2\x80\x9cshall be liable \xe2\x80\xa6 in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, as <em>Monell</em> explicitly stated, \xe2\x80\x9clocal governing bodies \xe2\x80\xa6 can be sued directly under \xc2\xa71983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes\xe2\x80\x9d a policy or custom. <em> </em>436 U. S.,<em> </em>at 690.  To find the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would also undermine <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic.  For whether an action or omission is a municipality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d has to do with the nature of the action or omission, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.

S. 658</a> (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 must show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or custom.  The case before the Court in <em>Monell </em>directly involved monetary damages.  The question presented is whether the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement also applies when plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunction or a declaratory judgment.  We conclude that it does so apply.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case arises out of the following circumstances: The California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa711164 <em>et seq.</em> (West Rev. Supp. 2010), requires law enforcement and other state agencies to investigate allegations of child abuse.  These agencies must report to the California Department of Justice all instances of reported child abuse the agency finds \xe2\x80\x9cnot unfounded,\xe2\x80\x9d even if they are \xe2\x80\x9cinconclusive or unsubstantiated.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711169(a), 11170(a)(3).  The statute requires the department to include all these reports in a Child Abuse Central Index (Index), where they remain available to various state agencies for at least 10 years.  \xc2\xa711170(a).  The statute also says that if</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ca report has previously been filed which subsequently proves to be unfounded, the Department of Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and shall not retain the report.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa711169(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe statute, however, does not set forth procedures for reviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded, or for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the Index.  Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had California or Los Angeles County created any such procedures.  But cf. \xc2\xa711170(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe submitting agencies are responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports described in this section\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of child abuse.  But they were later exonerated.  They sought to have their names removed from the Index.  Unable to convince the Los Angeles Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department to remove them, they filed this \xc2\xa71983 case against the attorney general of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two detectives in the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department, and the County of Los Angeles.  They sought damages, an injunction, and a declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural mechanism through which one could contest inclusion on the Index.  See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  The District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment to all of the defendants on the ground that California had not deprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d interest.  But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to provide those included on the list notice and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some kind of hearing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d 1170, 1201 (2009).  Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were entitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on remand) they might prove damages as well.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately $600,000 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b) (providing for payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to parties prevailing on \xc2\xa71983 claims).  See No. 05\xe2\x80\x9356467 (June 22, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1\xe2\x80\x934 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05\xe2\x80\x9356467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition 1\xe2\x80\x932 (hereinafter Second Fee Order).  The Ninth Circuit wrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately $60,000 of this amount.  First Fee Order 3; Second Fee Order 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and therefore that it could be held responsible for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  It argued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties.  That is because the county is a municipal entity.  Under <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s holding a municipal entity is liable under \xc2\xa71983 only if a municipal \xe2\x80\x9c<em>policy or custom</em>\xe2\x80\x9d caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.  436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added).  And it was <em>state</em> policy, not <em>county</em> policy, that brought about any deprivation here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as follows: First, it said that county policy <em>might </em>be responsible for the deprivation.  It \xe2\x80\x9cis possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ninth Circuit said, that the county, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y failing to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] an independent procedure that would allow\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cto challenge their listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that violated\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1202.  Second, it said that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause this issue is not clear based on the record before us on appeal \xe2\x80\xa6 we remand to the district court to determine the County\xe2\x80\x99s liability under <em>Monell.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Ibid.  </em>Third, it saw no reason to remand in respect to the county\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to pay $60,000 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  That, it wrote, is because <em>\xe2\x80\x9cin our circuit</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0<em>the limitations to liability established in </em>Monell<em> do not apply to claims for prospective relief,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d such as the declaratory judgment that the Circuit had ordered entered.  First Fee Order 3\xe2\x80\x934 (citing <em>Chaloux</em> v. <em>Killeen</em>, 886 F.\xc2\xa02d 247, 250 (CA9 1989); <em>Truth</em> v. <em>Kent School Dist.</em>, 542 F.\xc2\xa03d 634, 644 (CA9 2008); emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned Ninth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement applies only to claims for damages but not to claims for prospective relief.  Because the Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we granted the county\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  Compare <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>Giuliani</em>, 506 F.\xc2\xa03d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (holding that <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement applies to claims for prospective relief as well as claims for damages); <em>Dirrane</em> v. <em>Brookline Police Dept.</em>, 315 F.\xc2\xa03d 65, 71 (CA1 2002) (same); <em>Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters Assn., Local 3157</em> v. <em>Greensboro</em>, 64 F.\xc2\xa03d 962, 967, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA4 1995) (applying the <em>Monell</em> requirement to a prospective relief claim); <em>Church</em> v. <em>Huntsville</em>, 30 F.\xc2\xa03d 1332, 1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with <em>Chaloux</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 251 (holding that <em>Monell</em> does not apply to prospective relief claims).  See also <em>Gernetzke</em> v. <em>Kenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1</em>, 274 F.\xc2\xa03d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the question but noting the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominant\xe2\x80\x9d view that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding applies regardless of the nature of the relief sought\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>holding applies to \xc2\xa71983 claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well as to claims for damages. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with \xc2\xa71983 itself, which provides: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEvery <em>person</em> who, under color of any [state] statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 subjects, or causes to be subjected, any \xe2\x80\xa6 other person\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 to the deprivation of any rights \xe2\x80\xa6 secured by the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn 1961, in <em>Monroe </em>v.<em> Pape, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/index.html">365 U. S. 167</a><em>, </em>this Court held that municipal entities were not \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71983.  The Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  It noted that Congress rejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment) that would have made municipalities liable for damage done by <em>private </em>persons \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98riotously and tumultuously assembled.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 188\xe2\x80\x93190, and n.\xc2\xa038 (quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)).  This rejection, the Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871 House of Representatives that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress had no constitutional power to impose <em>any obligation </em>upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U. S., at 190 (quoting Cong. Globe, <em>supra, </em>at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland); emphasis added).  The Court concluded that Congress must have doubted its \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional power . . . to impose civil liability on municipalities.\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U. S., at 190.  And for that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude municipal corporations as \xc2\xa71983 defendants.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s key term \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d therefore did not cover municipal entities.  <em>Id.</em>, at 191.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sixteen years later, in <em>Monell</em>,<em> </em>the Court reconsidered the question of municipal liability.  After reexamining the 1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it would have imposed liability upon municipalities, but because it would have imposed liability upon municipalities based purely upon the <em>acts of others.  </em>That is to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed liability upon local governments \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to whether a local government <em>was in any way at fault</em> for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added).  In <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>view Congress may have thought that it lacked the power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon municipalities, <em>id.</em>, at 679, but <em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em>nothing<em> </em>said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable \xe2\x80\xa6 for <em>its own </em>violations of the Fourteenth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 683 (emphasis added).  The Court, overruling <em>Monroe, </em>held that municipalities were \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71983.  436 U. S., at 690.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also concluded that a municipality could not be held liable under \xc2\xa71983 solely because it employed a tortfeasor.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion rested on \xe2\x80\x9cthe language of \xc2\xa71983, read against the background of the same legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 691.  Section 1983\xe2\x80\x99s causation language imposes liability on a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98person who \xe2\x80\xa6 shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to a deprivation of federal rights.  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting 17 Stat.\xc2\xa013; emphasis deleted).  That language, the Court observed, could not \xe2\x80\x9cbe easily read to impose liability vicariously \xe2\x80\xa6 solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.\xe2\x80\x9d  436 U. S., at 692.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, in particular the constitutional objections that had been raised to the Sherman amendment, supported this conclusion.  <em>Id.</em>, at 692\xe2\x80\x9394, and n. 57.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the Court concluded that a municipality could be held liable under \xc2\xa71983 only for its own violations of federal law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 694.  The Court described what made a violation a municipality\xe2\x80\x99s <em>own </em>violation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLocal governing bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under \xc2\xa71983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\xe2\x80\x99s officers. \xe2\x80\xa6 [They can also be sued for] deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \xe2\x80\x98custom\xe2\x80\x99 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\xe2\x80\x99s official decisionmaking channels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 690\xe2\x80\x93691 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court has also included the terms \xe2\x80\x9cusage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d as customs for which liability is appropriate.  See <em>ibid.</em>  The length of this list of types of municipal action leads us here to use a shorthand term \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom,\xe2\x80\x9d but when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list.  See <em>id.</em>, at 694 (using the shorthand \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Fitzgerald</em> v. <em>Barnstable School Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/246/index.html">555 U.

But the municipality may be held liable \xe2\x80\x9cwhen execution of a government\xe2\x80\x99s <em>policy or custom</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 inflicts the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 694 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language of \xc2\xa71983 read in light of <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the legislative history explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall within the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>requirement.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa71983 suggests that the causation requirement contained in the statute should change with the form of relief sought.  In fact, the text suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x99s elements \xe2\x80\x9cshall be liable \xe2\x80\xa6 in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, as <em>Monell</em> explicitly stated, \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ocal governing bodies \xe2\x80\xa6 can be sued directly under \xc2\xa71983 for monetary, <em>declaratory, or injunctive relief</em> where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes\xe2\x80\x9d a policy or custom.  436 U. S.,<em> </em>at 690 (emphasis added).  <em>Monell </em>went on to quote this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement in a 1973 case, <em>Kenosha</em> v. <em>Bruno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/507/index.html">412 U. S. 507</a>, 513, to the effect that the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa71983 did not intend the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98generic word \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  436 U. S., at 701, n.\xc2\xa066 (emphasis added).  <em>Monell </em>added that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing we say today affects\xe2\x80\x9d this pre-<em>Monell</em> \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>logic also argues against any such relief-based bifurcation.  The <em>Monell </em>Court thought that Congress intended potential \xc2\xa71983 liability where a municipality\xe2\x80\x99s <em>own</em> violations were at issue but not where only the violations of <em>others </em>were at issue.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in law.  To find the requirement inapplicable where prospective relief is at issue would undermine <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic.  For whether an action or omission is a municipality\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d has to do with the nature of the action or omission, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Humphries\xe2\x80\x99 (hereinafter respondents) arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.  Respondents correctly note that by the time <em>Monell </em>reached the Supreme Court only the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 damages claim remained live.  See <em>id.</em>, at 661.  From this fact they conclude that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding applies directly only to claims for monetary damages.  A holding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the specific facts of the particular case.  It does so here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents add that not only did <em>Monell</em> involve a damages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that municipalities might have to pay large damages awards.  The Court so suggests when it points out that municipalities should not be liable for an employee\xe2\x80\x99s wrongful acts, simply by applying agency-based principles of <em>respondeat superior.  </em>But as we have pointed out, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability primarily rested not on the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s economic needs, but on the fact that liability in such a case does not arise out of the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s own wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief is at issue, <em>Monell </em>is redundant.  They say that a court cannot grant prospective relief against a municipality unless the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct has caused the violation.  Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper, the <em>Monell</em> requirement \xe2\x80\x9cshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t screen out any case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied, however, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unnecessary.  If respondents are right, our holding may have limited practical significance.  But that possibility does not provide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by adopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal liability that the Court has previously rejected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument that applying <em>Monell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement to prospective relief claims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional violations beyond redress.  Despite the fact that four Circuits apply <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>requirement to prospective relief, however, respondents have not presented us with any actual or hypothetical example that provides serious cause for concern.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we hold that <em>Monell\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cpolicy or custom\xe2\x80\x9d requirement applies in \xc2\xa71983 cases irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
