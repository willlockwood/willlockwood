The prisoners claimed, based on several theories, that the Constitution required that they be provided with counsel at the Commonwealth\'s expense for the purpose of pursuing collateral proceedings related to their convictions and sentences.  The courts below ruled that appointment of counsel upon request was necessary for the prisoners to enjoy their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 492 U.

Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html">430 U. S. 817</a></span> (1977).</p>\n<p>Joseph M. Giarratano is a Virginia prisoner under a sentence of death.  He initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, by <em>pro se</em> complaint in Federal District Court, against various state officials including Edward W. Murray, who is the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections.  Some months later, the District Court certified a class comprising all current and future Virginia inmates awaiting execution who do not have and cannot afford counsel to pursue postconviction proceedings. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The inmates asserted a number of constitutional theories for an entitlement to appointed counsel, and the case was tried to the court.</p>\n<p>After the evidence, post-trial briefs, and other memoranda, the District Court expressed "serious doubts as to the viability of many of th[e] theories."  668 F.Supp. 511, 512 (ED Va. 1986).  It was, however, "satisfied that the United States Supreme Court\'s decision in <em>Bounds</em> dictates that the plaintiffs here be granted some form of relief."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court noted three special "considerations" relating to death row inmates that it believed required that these inmates receive greater assistance than <em>Bounds</em> had outlined.  It found that death row inmates had a limited amount of time to prepare their petitions, that their cases were unusually complex, and that the shadow of impending execution would interfere with their ability to do legal work.  These "considerations" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 492 U. S. 5</a></p><p> led the court to believe that the "plaintiffs are incapable of effectively using lawbooks to raise their claims."  As a result, it found that Virginia\'s policy of either allowing death row inmates time in the prison law library or permitting them to have lawbooks sent to their cells did "little to satisfy Virginia\'s obligation." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  668 F.Supp. at 513.  "Virginia must fulfill its duty by providing these inmates trained legal assistance."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court then evaluated the avenues by which inmates convicted of capital crimes could obtain the aid of counsel in Virginia.  It found inadequate the availability of "unit attorneys" appointed by Virginia to the various penal institutions to assist inmates in incarcertion-related litigation.  <em>Id.</em> at 514.  Further, it found that,</p>\n<p>"[e]ven if Virginia appointed additional institutional attorneys to service death row inmates, its duty under <em>Bounds</em> would not be fulfilled"</p>\n<p>because, acting "only as legal advisors," "[t]he scope of assistance these attorneys provide is simply too limited."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Along the same lines, the District Court concluded that Virginia\'s provisions for appointment of counsel after a petition is filed did not cure the problem. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This was primarily because "the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 492 U. S. 6</a></p><p> timing of the appointment is a fatal defect" as the inmate "would not receive the attorney\'s assistance in the critical stages of developing his claims."  <em>Id.</em> at 515.</p>\n<p>Even together, Virginia\'s efforts did not afford prisoners a meaningful right of access to the courts, in the opinion of the District Court, because they did not guarantee them "the continuous assistance of counsel."  <em>Ibid.</em>  With what the District Court feared was the imminent depletion of the pool of volunteer attorneys willing to help Virginia death row inmates attack their convictions and sentences, the court felt that "[t]he stakes are simply too high for this Court not to grant, at least in part, some relief."  It therefore ordered Virginia to develop a program for the appointment of counsel, upon request, to indigent death row inmates wishing to pursue habeas corpus in state court.  <em>Id.</em> at 517.  It decided, however, that the decision in <em>Ross v. Moffitt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/600/case.html">417 U. S. 600</a></span> (1974), indicated that Virginia had no similar constitutional obligation to appoint counsel for the pursuit of habeas corpus in federal court.  668 F.Supp. at 516-517.</p>\n<p>On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a divided panel reversed the District Court\'s judgment that the Commonwealth was constitutionally required to provide personal attorneys to represent death row inmates in state collateral proceedings.  836 F.2d 1421 (1988).  But that court, en banc, subsequently. reheard the case and affirmed the District Court. 847 F.2d 1118 (1988).  The en banc court viewed as findings of fact the special "considerations" relating to death row inmates which had lead the District Court to conclude that Virginia was not in compliance with the constitutional rights of access.  It accepted these findings as not clearly erroneous, and so affirmed the the District Court\'s remedial order.  The en banc court did not believe the case to be controlled by <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/551/case.html">Pennsylvania v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 492 U.

"<em>Finley</em> was not a meaningful access case, nor did it address the rule enunciated in <em>Bounds v. Smith.</em>"  847 F.2d at 1122.  "Most significantly," thought the Fourth Circuit, "<em>Finley</em> did not involve the death penalty."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Four judges dissented.  We granted certiorari, 488 U.S. 923 (1988), and now reverse.</p>\n<p>In <em>Finley,</em> we ruled that neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor the equal protection guarantee of "meaningful access" required the State to appoint counsel for indigent prisoners seeking state postconviction relief.  The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution assure the right of an indigent defendant to counsel at the trial stage of a criminal proceeding, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span> (1963), and an indigent defendant is similarly entitled as a matter of right to counsel for an initial appeal from the judgment and sentence of the trial court.  <em>Douglas v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/353/case.html">372 U. S. 353</a></span> (1963); <em>Griffin v.

Moffitt, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/600/case.html#610">417 U. S. 610</a></span>, that the right to counsel at these earlier stages of a criminal procedure did not carry over to a discretionary appeal provided by North Carolina law from the intermediate appellate court to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.  We contrasted the trial stage of a criminal proceeding, where the State by presenting witnesses and arguing to a jury attempts to strip from the defendant the presumption of innocence and convict him of a crime, with the appellate stage of such a proceeding, where the defendant needs an attorney</p>\n<p>"not as a shield to protect him against being \'haled into court\' by the State and stripped of his presumption of innocence, but rather as a sword to upset the prior determination of guilt."</p>\n<p>417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/600/case.html#610">417 U.

In the same vein, they contend that due process requires appointed counsel in postconviction proceedings because of the nature of the punishment and the need for accuracy.  <em>Id.</em> at 48-49.</p>\n<p>We have recognized on more than one occasion that the Constitution places special constraints on the procedures used to convict an accused of a capital offense and sentence him to death.  <em>See, e.g., Beck v.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The additional safeguards imposed by the Eighth Amendment at the trial stage of a capital case are, we think, sufficient to assure the reliability of the process by which the death penalty is imposed.

S. 30</a></span>.  But this "mother knows best" approach should play no part in traditional constitutional adjudication.  Even as a matter of policy, the correctness of the dissent\'s view is by no means self-evident.  If, as we said in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, supra,</em> direct appeal is the primary avenue for review of capital cases as well as other sentences, Virginia may quite sensibly decide to concentrate the resources it devotes to providing attorneys for capital defendants at the trial and appellate stages of a capital proceeding.  Capable lawyering there would mean fewer colorable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to be litigated on collateral attack.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, as an additional basis for its holding, relied on what it perceived as a tension between the rule in <em>Finley</em> and the implication of our decisions in <em>Bounds v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html">430 U. S. 817</a></span> (1977); we find no such tension.  Whether the right of access at issue in <em>Bounds</em> is primarily one of due process or equal protection, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] in either case it rests on a constitutional theory considered in <em>Finley.</em>  The Court held in <em>Bounds</em> that a prisoner\'s "right of access" to the courts required a State to furnish access to adequate law libraries in order that the prisoners might prepare petitions for judicial relief.  <em>Bounds, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html#828">430 U. S. 828</a></span>.  But it would be a strange jurisprudence that permitted the extension of.that holding to partially overrule a subsequently decided case such as <em>Finley</em> which held that prisoners seeking judicial relief from their sentence in state proceedings were not entitled to counsel.</p>\n<p>It would be an even stranger jurisprudence to allow, as the dissent would, the "right of access" involved in <em>Bounds v. Smith, supra,</em> to partially overrule <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 492 U. S. 12</a></p><p> based on "factual" findings of a particular District Court regarding matters such as the perceived difficulty of capital sentencing law and the general psychology of death row inmates.  Treating such matters as "factual findings," presumably subject only to review under the "clearly-erroneous" standard, would permit a different constitutional rule to apply in a different State if the district judge hearing that claim reached different conclusions.  Our cases involving the right to counsel have never taken this tack; they have been categorical holdings as to what the Constitution requires with respect to a particular stage of a criminal proceeding in general.  <em>See Powell v.

It is unclear whether, in review of capital cases, counsel will be appointed under this statute or otherwise prior to filing and unless the petition presents a nonfrivolous claim.  <em>See Darnell v.

Consequently, a substantial balance of States do not accord the right that the dissent would require Virginia to grant as a matter of constitutional law.  Virginia courts presently have the authority to appoint counsel to represent any inmate in state habeas proceedings, Va.Code \xc2\xa7 14.1-183 (Supp. 1988), and the attorney general represents that such appointments have been made, upon request, before the filing of any petition.

Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, attorneys will be appointed in federal habeas corpus actions involving a challenge to a death sentence.  <em>See</em> Pub. L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181.  Respondents suggest that appointment of counsel might even benefit Virginia by speeding, or at least clarifying, the Virginia postconviction process.  The situation of death row inmates may well be the basis for state policy to provide them extra legal assistance or more lenient standards of <em>pro se</em> pleading.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\'S opinion.  As his opinion demonstrates, there is nothing in the Constitution or the precedents of this Court that requires that a State provide counsel in postconviction proceedings.  A postconviction proceeding is not part of the criminal process itself, but is instead a civil action designed to overturn a presumptively valid criminal judgment.  Nothing in the Constitution requires the States to provide such proceedings, <em>see Pennsylvania v. Finley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/551/case.html">481 U. S. 551</a></span> (1987), nor does it seem to me that the Constitution requires the States to follow any particular federal model in those proceedings.  I also join in JUSTICE KENNEDY\'S opinion concurring in the judgment, since I do not view it as inconsistent with the principles expressed above.  As JUSTICE KENNEDY observes, our decision in <em>Bounds v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html">430 U. S. 817</a></span> (1977), allows the States considerable discretion in assuring that those imprisoned in their jails obtain meaningful access to the judicial process.  Beyond the requirements of <em>Bounds,</em> the matter is one of legislative choice based on difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources.  Our decision today rightly leaves these issues to resolution by Congress and the state legislatures. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 492 U. S. 14</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE O\'CONNOR joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>It cannot be denied that collateral relief proceedings are a central part of the review process for prisoners sentenced to death.  As JUSTICE STEVENS observes, a substantial proportion of these prisoners succeed in having their death sentences vacated in habeas corpus proceedings.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/1/case.html#23">492 U. S. 23</a></span>-24, and n. 13.  The complexity of our jurisprudence in this area, moreover, makes it unlikely that capital defendants will be able to file successful petitions for collateral relief without the assistance of persons learned in the law.</p>\n<p>The requirement of meaningful access can be satisfied in various ways, however.  This was made explicit in our decision in <em>Bounds v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html">430 U. S. 817</a></span> (1977).  The intricacies and range of options are of sufficient complexity that state legislatures and prison administrators must be given "wide discretion" to select appropriate solutions.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html#833">430 U. S. 833</a></span>.  Indeed, judicial imposition of a categorical remedy such as that adopted by the court below might pretermit other responsible solutions being considered in Congress and state legislatures.  Assessments of the difficulties presented by collateral litigation in capital cases are now being conducted by committees of the American Bar Association and the Judicial Conference of the United States, and Congress has stated its intention to give the matter serious consideration.  <em>See</em> 134 Cong.Rec. H11194 (Oct. 21, 1988) (providing for expedited consideration of proposals of the Judicial Conference committee).</p>\n<p>Unlike Congress, this Court lacks the capacity to undertake the searching and comprehensive review called for in this area, for we can decide only the case before us.  While Virginia has not adopted procedures for securing representation that are as far-reaching and effective as those available in other States, no prisoner on death row in Virginia has been unable to obtain counsel to represent him in postconviction proceedings, and Virginia\'s prison system is staffed with institutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 492 U. S. 15</a></p><p> lawyers to assist in preparing petitions for postconviction relief.  I am not prepared to say that this scheme violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On the facts and record of this case, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Two Terms ago, this Court reaffirmed that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution obligates a State "<em>to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State\'s appellate process.\'"  <em>Pennsylvania v.

The narrow question presented is whether that obligation includes appointment of counsel for indigent death row inmates who wish to pursue state postconviction relief.

Finding no rational basis for requiring appellants to pay for trial transcripts, "effectively den[ying] the poor an adequate appellate review accorded to all who have money enough to pay the costs in advance," the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment required States to furnish transcripts to indigents.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html#18">351 U.

Although one might distinguish these opinions as having a different legal basis than the present case, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] it is preferable to consider them, like <em>Powell, Griffin, Douglas,</em> and <em>Bounds,</em> as applications of the Fourteenth Amendment\'s guarantees to particular situations.

Three critical differences between <em>Finley</em> and this case demonstrate that, even if it is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 492 U. S. 20</a></p><p> permissible to leave an ordinary prisoner to his own resources in collateral proceedings, it is fundamentally unfair to require an indigent death row inmate to initiate collateral review without counsel\'s guiding hand.  I shall address each of these differences in turn.</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  These respondents, like petitioners in <em>Powell</em> but unlike respondent in <em>Finley,</em> have been condemned to die.  Legislatures conferred greater access to counsel on capital defendants than on persons facing lesser punishment even in colonial times. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Our First Congress required assignment of up to two attorneys to a capital defendant at the same time it initiated capital punishment; [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] nearly a century passed before Congress provided for appointment of counsel in other contexts.  <em>See Mallard v. United States District Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/296/case.html">490 U. S. 296</a></span> (1989) (interpreting Act of July 20, 1892, ch. 209, \xc2\xa7 1, 27 Stat. 252, now codified at 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915(d)).  Similarly, Congress at first limited the federal right of appeal to capital cases.  <em>See Evitts v. Lucey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/387/case.html">469 U.

Just last year, it enacted a statute requiring provision of counsel for state and federal prisoners seeking federal postconviction relief -- but only if they are under sentence of death. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 492 U. S. 21</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court also expanded capital defendants\' ability to secure counsel and other legal assistance long before bestowing similar privileges on persons accused of less serious crimes. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Both before and after <em>Furman v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/case.html">408 U. S. 238</a></span> (1972), established that the Constitution requires channeling of the death-sentencing decision, various Members of this Court have recognized that "the penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however long."  <em>Woodson v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/case.html">428 U.

S. 22</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The unique nature of the death penalty not only necessitates additional protections during pretrial, guilt, and sentencing phases, [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] but also enhances the importance of the appellate process.  Generally there is no constitutional right to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 492 U. S. 23</a></p><p> appeal a conviction.  <em>See, e.g., McKane v. Durston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/153/684/case.html">153 U. S. 684</a></span> (1894).  "[M]eaningful appellate review" in capital cases, however, "serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty."  <em>Gregg v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U.

It is therefore an integral component of a State\'s</p>\n<p>"constitutional responsibility to tailor and apply its law in a manner that avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty."</p>\n<p><em>Godfrey v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/case.html">446 U. S. 420</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/case.html#428">446 U. S. 428</a></span> (1980). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Ideally,</p>\n<p>"direct appeal is the primary avenue for review of a conviction or sentence, and death penalty cases are no exception.  When the process of direct review . . . comes to an end, a presumption of finality and legality attaches to the conviction and sentence."</p>\n<p><em>Barefoot v. Estelle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/880/case.html">463 U. S. 880</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/880/case.html#887">463 U. S. 887</a></span> (1983).  There is, however, significant evidence that, in capital cases, what is ordinarily considered direct review does not sufficiently safeguard against miscarriages of justice to warrant this presumption of finality. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Federal habeas </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 492 U. S. 24</a></p><p> courts granted relief in only 0.25% to 7% of noncapital cases in recent years; in striking contrast, the success rate in capital cases ranged from 60% to 70%. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Such a high incidence of uncorrected error demonstrates that the meaningful appellate review necessary in a capital case extends beyond the direct appellate process.</p>\n<p><em>Second.</em>  In contrast to the collateral process discussed in <em>Finley,</em> Virginia law contemplates that some claims ordinarily heard on direct review will be relegated to postconviction proceedings.  Claims that trial or appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance, for instance, usually cannot be raised until this stage.  <em>See Frye v. Commonwealth,</em> 231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986).  Furthermore, some irregularities, such as prosecutorial misconduct, may not surface until after the direct review is complete.  <em>E.g., Amadeo v. Zant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/214/case.html">486 U. S. 214</a></span> (1988) (prosecutor deliberately underrepresented black people and women in jury pools); <em>Brady v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/case.html">373 U. S. 83</a></span> (1963).  Occasionally, new evidence even may suggest that the defendant is innocent.  <em>E.g., Ex parte Adams,</em> No. 70,787 (Tex.Cr.App., Mar. 1, 1989) (available on Lexis); <em>McDowell v. Dixon,</em> 858 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 492 U. S. 25</a></p><p> F.2d 945 (CA4 1988), <em>cert. denied,</em> 489 U.S. 1033 (1989).  Given the irreversibility of capital punishment, such information deserves searching, adversarial scrutiny even if it is discovered after the close of direct review.</p>\n<p>The postconviction procedure in Virginia may present the first opportunity for an attorney detached from past proceedings to examine the defense and to raise claims that were barred on direct review by prior counsel\'s ineffective assistance.  A fresh look may reveal, for example, that a prior conviction used to enhance the defendant\'s sentence was invalid, <em>e.g., Johnson v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/578/case.html">486 U. S. 578</a></span> (1988); or that the defendant\'s mental illness, lack of a prior record, or abusive childhood should have been introduced as evidence in mitigation at his sentencing hearing, <em>e.g., Curry v. Zant,</em> 258 Ga. 527, 371 S.E.2d 647 (1988).  Defense counsel\'s failure to object to or assert such claims precludes direct appellate review of them. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  The postconviction proceeding gives inmates another chance to rectify defaults. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  In Virginia, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 492 U. S. 26</a></p><p> therefore, postconviction proceedings are key to meaningful appellate review of capital cases.</p>\n<p>State postconviction proceedings also are the cornerstone for all subsequent attempts to obtain collateral relief.  Once a Virginia court determines that a claim is procedurally barred, a federal court may not review it unless the defendant can make one of two difficult showings:  that there was both cause for the default and resultant prejudice, or that failure to review will cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  <em>Murray v. Carrier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/478/case.html">477 U. S. 478</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/478/case.html#485">477 U.

S. 87</a></span> (1977).  If an asserted claim is tested in an evidentiary hearing, the state postconviction court\'s factual findings may control the scope of a federal court\'s review of a subsequent petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor may a defendant circumvent the state postconviction process by filing a federal habeas petition.  In <em>Rose v. Lundy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/case.html">455 U. S. 509</a></span> (1982), this Court held that, in order to comply with the exhaustion provision of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254(c), federal courts should dismiss petitions containing claims that have not been "fairly presented to the state courts," <em>Picard v. Connor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/270/case.html">404 U. S. 270</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/270/case.html#275">404 U. S. 275</a></span> (1971), for both direct and postconviction review, <em>Castille v. Peoples,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/346/case.html">489 U. S. 346</a></span> (1989).  Given the stringency with which this Court adheres to procedural default rules, [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] it is of great importance to the prisoner </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 492 U. S. 27</a></p><p> that all his substantial claims be presented fully and professionally in his first state collateral proceeding. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  As the District Court\'s findings reflect, the plight of the death row inmate constrains his ability to wage collateral attacks far more than does the lot of the ordinary inmate considered in <em>Finley.</em> [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  The District Court found that the death row inmate has an extremely limited period to prepare and present his postconviction petition and any necessary applications for stays of execution.  668 F.Supp. 511, 513 (ED Va. 1986).  Unlike the ordinary inmate, who presumably has ample time to use and reuse the prison library and to seek guidance from other prisoners experienced in preparing <em>pro se</em> petitions, <em>cf. Johnson v. Avery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/483/case.html">393 U. S. 483</a></span> (1969), a grim deadline imposes a finite limit on the condemned person\'s capacity for useful research. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>Capital litigation, the District Court observed, is extremely complex.  668 F.Supp. at 513.  Without regard to the special characteristics of Virginia\'s statutory procedures, [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 492 U. S. 28</a></p><p> this Court\'s death penalty jurisprudence unquestionably is difficult even for a trained lawyer to master. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  A judgment that it is not unfair to require an ordinary inmate to rely on his own resources to prepare a petition for postconviction relief, <em>see Finley,</em> 481 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/551/case.html#557">481 U. S. 557</a></span>, does not justify the same conclusion for the death row inmate, who must acquire an understanding of this specialized area of the law and prepare an application for stay of execution as well as a petition for collateral relief. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  This is especially true, the District Court concluded, because the</p>\n<p>"evidence gives rise to a fair inference that an inmate preparing himself and his family for impending death is incapable of performing the mental functions necessary to adequately pursue his claims. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]"</p>\n<p>668 F.Supp. at 513. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 492 U. S. 29</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These three critical factors demonstrate that there is a profound difference between capital postconviction litigation and ordinary postconviction litigation in Virginia.  The District Court\'s findings unequivocally support the conclusion that, to obtain an adequate opportunity to present their postconviction claims fairly, death row inmates need greater assistance of counsel than Virginia affords them.  <em>Cf. id.</em> at 514-515.  Meaningful access, and meaningful judicial review, would be effected in this case only if counsel were appointed, on request, in time to enable examination of the case record, factual investigation, and preparation of a petition containing all meritorious claims, which the same attorney then could litigate to its conclusion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although in some circumstances governmental interests may justify infringements on Fourteenth Amendment rights, <em>cf. Mathews v. Eldridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html">424 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#334">424 U. S. 334</a></span>-335 (1976), Virginia has failed to assert any interest that outweighs respondents\' right to legal assistance.  The State already appoints counsel to death row inmates who succeed in filing postconviction petitions asserting at least one nonfrivolous claim; therefore, the additional cost of providing its 32 death row inmates competent counsel to prepare such petitions should be minimal.  <em>See</em> 668 F.Supp. at 512, 515.  Furthermore, multiple filings delay the conclusion of capital litigation and exacerbate the already serious burden these cases impose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 492 U. S. 30</a></p><p> on the State\'s judicial system and the legal department.  It seems obvious that professional preparation of the first postconviction petition, by reducing successive petitions, would result in a net benefit to Virginia. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>Of the 37 States authorizing capital punishment, at least 18 automatically provide their indigent death row inmates counsel to help them initiate state collateral proceedings. [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]  Thirteen of the 37 States have created governmentally funded resource </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 492 U. S. 31</a></p><p> centers to assist counsel in litigating capital cases. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  Virginia is among as few as five States that fall into neither group, and have no system for appointing counsel for condemned prisoners before a postconviction petition is filed. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]  In <em>Griffin,</em> the Court proscribed Illinois\' discriminatory barrier to appellate review in part because many other States already had rejected such a barrier.  351 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/case.html#19">351 U.
