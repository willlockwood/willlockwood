The ATS provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.  The District Court dismissed several of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability.  This Court granted certiorari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS, for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.

It permits federal courts to \xe2\x80\x9crecognize private claims [for a modest number of international law violations] under federal common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692\n.  In contending that a claim under the ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s territory, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial application, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none,\xe2\x80\x9d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The presumption \xe2\x80\x9cserves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.\xe2\x80\x9d  EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n.  It is typically applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles similarly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be brought under the ATS.  Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this context, where the question is not what Congress has done but what courts may do.  These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only for alleged violations of international law norms that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98specific, universal, and obligatory,\xe2\x80\x9d 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 732.

Nothing in the ATS\xe2\x80\x99s text evinces a clear indication of extraterritorial reach.  Violations of the law of nations affecting aliens can occur either within or outside the United States.  And generic terms, like \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action,\xe2\x80\x9d do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.  See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at ___.  Petitioners also rely on the common-law \xe2\x80\x9ctransitory torts\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only justification for allowing a party to recover when the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,\xe2\x80\x9d Cuba R. Co. v. Crosby, \n\n222 U.\xc2\xa0S. 473\n.  The question under Sosa is not whether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action provided by foreign or even international law.  The question is instead whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under U.\xc2\xa0S. law to enforce a norm of international law.  That question is not answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe historical background against which the ATS was enacted also does not overcome the presumption.  When the ATS was passed, \xe2\x80\x9cthree principal offenses against the law of nations\xe2\x80\x9d had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.  Sosa, supra, at 723, 724.  Prominent contemporary examples of the first two offenses\xe2\x80\x94immediately before and after passage of the ATS\xe2\x80\x94provide no support for the proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.  And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other country, applying U.\xc2\xa0S. law to pirates does not typically impose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign policy consequences.  A 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford regarding the conduct of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens on both the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the ATS\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforcement of international norms.

When the complaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Shell Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Netherlands and England, respectively.  Their joint subsidiary, respondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and engaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.  According to the complaint, after concerned residents of Ogoniland began protesting the environmental effects of SPDC\xe2\x80\x99s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Government to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstrations.  Throughout the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the complaint alleges, Nigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni vil- lages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and destroying or looting property.  Petitioners further allege that respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by, among other things, providing the Nigerian forces with food, transportation, and compensation, as well as by al- lowing the Nigerian military to use respondents\xe2\x80\x99 property as a staging ground for attacks.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to the United States where they have been granted political asylum and now reside as legal residents.  See Supp. Brief for Petitioners 3, and n.\xc2\xa02.  They filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute and requesting relief under customary international law.  The ATS provides, in full, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.  According to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations by aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in committing (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against humanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary arrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life, liberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7) property destruction.  The District Court dismissed the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the facts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a violation of the law of nations.  The court denied respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining claims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to \xc2\xa71292(b).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, rea- soning that the law of nations does not recognize corpo- rate liability.  621 F.\xc2\xa03d 111 (2010).

Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \xc2\xa79, 1 Stat 77; see Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 942 (No. 9,895) (DC Pa. 1793); Bolchos v. Darrel, 3 F.

The statute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear certain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes of action.  We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692, \n714 (2004)\n, however, that the First Congress did not intend the provision to be \xe2\x80\x9cstillborn.\xe2\x80\x9d  The grant of jurisdiction is instead \xe2\x80\x9cbest read as having been enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for [a] modest number of international law violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 724.  We thus held that federal courts may \xe2\x80\x9crecognize private claims [for such violations] under federal common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 732.  The Court in Sosa rejected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim in that case for \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary arrest and detention,\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that it failed to state a violation of the law of nations with the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite content and acceptance among civilized nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 699, 732.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question here is not whether petitioners have stated a proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may reach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sovereign.  Respondents contend that claims under the ATS do not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpretation known as the presumption against extraterritorial application.  That canon provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none,\xe2\x80\x9d Morrison v.

Arabian American Oil Co., \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n248 (1991)\n (Aramco).  As this Court has explained:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cFor us to run interference in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a delicate field of international relations there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.

Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., \n\n353 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138, \n147 (1957)\n.  The presumption against extraterritorial application helps ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt an interpretation of U.\xc2\xa0S. law that carries foreign pol- icy consequences not clearly intended by the political branches.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe typically apply the presumption to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.  See, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (\xe2\x80\x9cThese cases present the issue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regulate the employment practices of United States employers who employ United States citizens abroad\xe2\x80\x9d); Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of extraterritorial application was a \xe2\x80\x9cmerits question,\xe2\x80\x9d not a question of jurisdiction).  The ATS, on the other hand, is \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sosa, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 713.  It does not directly regulate conduct or afford relief.  It instead allows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action based on sufficiently definite norms of international law.  But we think the principles underlying the canon of interpretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of action that may be brought under the ATS.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context of the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has done but instead what courts may do.  This Court in Sosa repeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in considering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in light of foreign policy concerns.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe potential [foreign policy] implications\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of recog- nizing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. causes [under the ATS] should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 727; see also id., at 727\xe2\x80\x93728 (\xe2\x80\x9cSince many attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation of new norms of international law would raise risks of adverse foreign policy consequences, they should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 727 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he possible collateral consequences of making international rules privately actionable argue for judicial caution\xe2\x80\x9d).  These concerns, which are implicated in any case arising under the ATS, are all the more pressing when the question is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches conduct within the territory of another sovereign.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only for alleged violations of international law norms that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98specific, universal, and obligatory.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 732 (quoting In\xc2\xa0re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F.\xc2\xa03d 1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)).

See id., \xc2\xa73 (providing detailed definitions for extrajudicial killing and torture); id., \xc2\xa72 (specifying who may be liable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a statute of limitations).  Each of these decisions carries with it significant foreign policy implications.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe principles underlying the presumption against ex- traterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power under the ATS.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners contend that even if the presumption applies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut it for causes of action brought under that statute.  It is true that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can indicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct occurring abroad.

The ATS covers actions by aliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does not imply extraterritorial reach\xe2\x80\x94such violations affect- ing aliens can occur either within or outside the United States.  Nor does the fact that the text reaches \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action\xe2\x80\x9d suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is well established that generic terms like \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cevery\xe2\x80\x9d do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.

They claim that in using that word, the First Congress \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily meant to provide for jurisdiction over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise on foreign soil.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18.  For support, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed courts to assume jurisdiction over such \xe2\x80\x9ctransitory torts,\xe2\x80\x9d including actions for personal injury, arising abroad.

The question under Sosa is not whether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action provided by foreign or even international law.  The question is instead whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under U.\xc2\xa0S. law to enforce a norm of international law.  The reference to \xe2\x80\x9ctort\xe2\x80\x9d does not demonstrate that the First Congress \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily meant\xe2\x80\x9d for those causes of action to reach conduct in the territory of a foreign sovereign.  In the end, nothing in the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication of extraterritoriality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does the historical background against which the ATS was enacted overcome the presumption against ap- plication to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.  See Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ssuredly context can be consulted\xe2\x80\x9d in determining whether a cause of action applies abroad).  We explained in Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, \xe2\x80\x9cthree principal offenses against the law of nations\xe2\x80\x9d had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 68 (1769).  The first two offenses have no necessary extraterritorial application.  Indeed, Blackstone\xe2\x80\x94in describing them\xe2\x80\x94did so in terms of conduct occur- ring within the forum nation.  See ibid. (describing the right of safe conducts for those \xe2\x80\x9cwho are here\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 id., at 251 (1765) (explaining that safe conducts grant a member of one society \xe2\x80\x9ca right to intrude into another\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 245\xe2\x80\x93248 (recognizing the king\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[e] ambassadors at home\xe2\x80\x9d and detailing their rights in the state \xe2\x80\x9cwherein they are appointed to reside\xe2\x80\x9d); see also E.

Each concerned the rights of ambas- sadors, and each involved conduct within the Union.  In 1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically assaulted Francis Barbe Marbois\xe2\x80\x94the Secretary of the French Legion\xe2\x80\x94in Philadelphia.  The assault led the French Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest with the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the country unless an adequate remedy were provided.  Respublica v. De Longschamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O.\xc2\xa0T. Phila. 1784); Sosa, supra, at 716\xe2\x80\x93717, and n.\xc2\xa011.  And in 1787, a New York constable entered the Dutch Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s house and arrested one of his domestic servants.  See Casto, The Federal Courts\xe2\x80\x99 Protective Jurisdiction over Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18 Conn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 467, 494 (1986).  At the request of Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City arrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet passed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of Ambassadors,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the extent of any available relief would depend on the common law.  See Bradley, The Alien Tort Statute and Article III, 42 Va. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 587, 641\xe2\x80\x93642 (2002) (quoting 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States of America 447 (1837)).  The two cases in which the ATS was invoked shortly after its passage also concerned conduct within the territory of the United States.  See Bolchos, 3 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 810 (wrongful seizure of slaves from a vessel while in port in the United States); Moxon, 17 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 942 (wrongful seizure in United States territorial waters).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese prominent contemporary examples\xe2\x80\x94immediately before and after passage of the ATS\xe2\x80\x94provide no support for the proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe third example of a violation of the law of nations familiar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.  Piracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other country.  See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe offence of piracy, by common law, consists of committing those acts of robbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if committed upon land, would have amounted to felony there\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has generally treated the high seas the same as foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against extraterritorial application.  See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155\n\xe2\x80\x93174 (1993) (declining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428, \n440 (1989)\n (declining to apply a provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).  Petitioners contend that because Congress surely intended the ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates, it necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to conduct occurring abroad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying U.\xc2\xa0S. law to pirates, however, does not typi- cally impose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign policy consequences.  Pirates were fair game wherever found, by any nation, because they generally did not operate within any jurisdiction.  See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 71.  We do not think that the existence of a cause of action against them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other causes of action under the ATS reach conduct that does occur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates may well be a category unto themselves.  See Morrison, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Microsoft Corp., 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 455\xe2\x80\x93456.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners also point to a 1795 opinion authored by Attorney General William Bradford.  See Breach of Neutrality, 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57.  In 1794, in the midst of war between France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding the American official policy of neutrality, several U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and plundered the British colony of Sierra Leone.  In response to a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney General Bradford responded as follows:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo far .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the transactions complained of originated or took place in a foreign country, they are not within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the United States.  But crimes committed on the high seas are within the jurisdiction of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts of the United States; and, so far as the offence was committed thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be legally prosecuted in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. those courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  But some doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.  But there can be no doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostil- ity have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 58\xe2\x80\x9359.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners read the last sentence as confirming that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to law of nations violations committed on the territory of a foreign sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33.  Respondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford referred to \xe2\x80\x9cthese acts of hostility,\xe2\x80\x9d he meant the acts only insofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his conclusion were broader, it was only because the applicable treaty had extraterritorial reach.  See Supp. Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  The Solicitor General, having once read the opinion to stand for the proposition that an \xe2\x80\x9cATS suit could be brought against American citizens for breaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take place in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d Supp. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8, n.\xc2\xa01 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), now suggests the opinion \xe2\x80\x9ccould have been meant to encompass .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. conduct [occurring within the foreign territory],\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 8.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s opinion defies a definitive reading and we need not adopt one here.  Whatever its pre- cise meaning, it deals with U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens who, by partic- ipating in an attack taking place both on the high seas and on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the United States and Great Britain.  The opinion hardly suffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforcement of international norms.

The La Jeune Eugenie, 26 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC. Mass. 1822).  It is implausible to suppose that the First Congress wanted their fledgling Republic\xe2\x80\x94struggling to receive international recognition\xe2\x80\x94to be the first.  Indeed, the parties offer no evidence that any nation, meek or mighty, presumed to do such a thing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States was, however, embarrassed by its potential inability to provide judicial relief to foreign officials injured in the United States.

The ATS ensured that the United States could provide a forum for adjudicating such incidents.  See Sosa, supra, at 715\xe2\x80\x93718, and n. 11.  Nothing about this historical context suggests that Congress also intended federal common law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for conduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing such a cause of action could have generated it.  Recent experience bears this out.  See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F.\xc2\xa03d 11, 77\xe2\x80\x9378 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial applications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, accepting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view would imply that other nations, also applying the law of nations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of nations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else in the world.

In other words, only conduct that satisfies Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s requirements of definiteness and ac-ceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98focus\xe2\x80\x99 of congressional concern,\xe2\x80\x9d Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), when Congress enacted the ATS.  As a result, a putative ATS cause of action will fall within the scope of the presumption against extraterritoriality\xe2\x80\x94and will therefore be barred\xe2\x80\x94unless the domestic conduct is sufficient to violate an international law norm that satisfies Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s requirements of definiteness and acceptance among civilized nations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970625">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x931491\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tESTHER KIOBEL, individually and on behalf of her late husband, Dr. BARINEM KIOBEL, et\xc2\xa0al., PETI- TIONERS v.

The Court sets forth four key propositions of law: First, the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under\xe2\x80\x9d the Alien Tort Statute.  Ante, at 13.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Third, there \xe2\x80\x9cis no clear indication of extraterritoria[l application] here,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9call the relevant conduct took place outside the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the claims\xe2\x80\x9d do not \xe2\x80\x9ctouch and concern the territory of the United States\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0with sufficient force to displace the presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fourth, that is in part because \xe2\x80\x9c[c]orporations are often present in many countries, and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnlike the Court, I would not invoke the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Rather, guided in part by principles and practices of foreign relations law, I would find jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged tort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an American national, or (3) the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct substantially and adversely affects an important American national interest, and that includes a distinct interest in preventing the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of mankind.

In Sosa the Court specified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), when enacted in 1789, \xe2\x80\x9cwas intended as jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 714.  We added that the statute gives today\xe2\x80\x99s courts the power to apply certain \xe2\x80\x9cjudge-made\xe2\x80\x9d damages law to victims of certain foreign affairs-related misconduct, including \xe2\x80\x9cthree specific offenses\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xe2\x80\x9cBlackstone referred,\xe2\x80\x9d namely \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 715.

Adjudicating any such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with those notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the sovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of its own laws and their enforcement.  Id., at 761 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  See also F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v.

See 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 724\xe2\x80\x93725 (majority opinion).  We provided a framework for answering that question by setting down principles drawn from international norms and designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar in character and specificity to piracy.

That presumption \xe2\x80\x9crests on the perception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic, not foreign matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  See ante, at 4.  The ATS, however, was enacted with \xe2\x80\x9cforeign matters\xe2\x80\x9d in mind.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text refers explicitly to \xe2\x80\x9calien[s],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctreat[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to address \xe2\x80\x9cviolations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial remedy and at the same time threatening serious con-sequences in international affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sosa, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 715.  And at least one of the three kinds of activities that we found to fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope, namely piracy, ibid., normally takes place abroad.  See 4 W.\xc2\xa0Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority cannot wish this piracy example away by emphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas.  See ante, at 10.  That is because the robbery and murder that make up piracy do not normally take place in the water; they take place on a ship.  And a ship is like land, in that it falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it flies.  See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, \n\n372 U.\xc2\xa0S. 10\n\xe2\x80\x9321 (1963); 2 Restatement \xc2\xa7502, Comment d (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]lag state has jurisdiction to prescribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall described piracy as an \xe2\x80\x9coffenc[e] against the nation under whose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular jurisdiction all on board the vessel are.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 632 (1818).  See United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197 (1820) (a crime committed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d of a foreign state and a crime committed \xe2\x80\x9cin the vessel of another nation\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cthe same thing\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority nonetheless tries to find a distinction between piracy at sea and similar cases on land.  It writes, \xe2\x80\x9cApplying U.\xc2\xa0S. law to pirates .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not typically impose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10 (emphasis added).  But, as I have just pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]pplying U.\xc2\xa0S. law to pirates\xe2\x80\x9d does typically involve applying our law to acts taking place within the jurisdiction of another sovereign.  Nor can the majority\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d sensibly dis-tinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse foreign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of 1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie bombing make all too clear.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority also writes, \xe2\x80\x9cPirates were fair game wherever found, by any nation, because they generally did not operate within any jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  I very much agree that pirates were fair game \xe2\x80\x9cwherever found.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, that is the point.  That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are today\xe2\x80\x99s pirates?  Certainly today\xe2\x80\x99s pirates include torturers and perpetrators of genocide.  And today, like the pirates of old, they are \xe2\x80\x9cfair game\xe2\x80\x9d where they are found.  Like those pirates, they are \xe2\x80\x9ccommon enemies of all mankind and all nations have an equal interest in their apprehension and punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Restatement \xc2\xa7404 Reporters\xe2\x80\x99 Note 1, p.\xc2\xa0256 (quoting In\xc2\xa0re Demjanjuk, 612 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 544, 556 (ND Ohio 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See Sosa, supra, at 732.  And just as a nation that harbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past centuries, see infra, at 8, so harboring \xe2\x80\x9ccommon enemies of all mankind\xe2\x80\x9d provokes similar concerns today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, as applied to the narrow class of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide significant support for the use of any presumption against extraterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary.  See also ante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally treated the high seas the same as foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against extraterritorial application\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, as the Court uses its \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against extraterritorial application,\xe2\x80\x9d it offers only limited help in deciding the question presented, namely \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).

But it also makes clear that a statutory claim might sometimes \xe2\x80\x9ctouch and concern the territory of the United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the presumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.  It leaves for another day the determination of just when the presumption against extraterritoriality might be \xe2\x80\x9covercome.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t In applying the ATS to acts \xe2\x80\x9coccurring within the territory of a[nother] sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d I would assume that Congress intended the statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional reach to match the statute\xe2\x80\x99s underlying substantive grasp.  That grasp, defined by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes set forth in Sosa, includes compensation for those injured by piracy and its modern-day equivalents, at least where allowing such compensation avoids \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d negative international \xe2\x80\x9cconsequences\xe2\x80\x9d for the United States.  542 U. S., at 715.  And just as we have looked to established international substantive norms to help determine the statute\xe2\x80\x99s substantive reach, id., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional norms to help determine the statute\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is helpful.  Section 402 recognizes that, subject to \xc2\xa7403\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crea-sonableness\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, a nation may apply its law (for example, federal common law, see 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93730) not only (1) to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ctakes place [or to persons or things] within its territory\xe2\x80\x9d but also (2) to the \xe2\x80\x9cactivities, interests, status, or relations of its nationals outside as well as within its territory,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory,\xe2\x80\x9d and (4) to certain foreign \xe2\x80\x9cconduct outside its territory .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that is directed against the security of the state or against a limited class of other state interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  In addition, \xc2\xa7404 of the Restatement explains that a \xe2\x80\x9cstate has jurisdiction to define and prescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by the community of nations as of universal concern, such as piracy, slave trade,\xe2\x80\x9d and analogous behavior.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsidering these jurisdictional norms in light of both the ATS\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose (to provide compensation for those injured by today\xe2\x80\x99s pirates) and Sosa\xe2\x80\x99s basic caution (to avoid international friction), I believe that the statute provides jurisdiction where (1) the alleged tort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an American national, or (3) the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct substantially and adversely affects an important American national interest, and that includes a distinct interest in preventing the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of mankind.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would interpret the statute as providing jurisdiction only where distinct American interests are at issue.  Doing so reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present statute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, \xe2\x80\x9cNo nation ha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the whole world.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

The defendants are two foreign corporations.  Their shares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  Their only presence in the United States consists of an office in New York City (actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that helps to explain their business to potential investors.  See Supp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App. 55.  The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but nationals of other nations.  The conduct at issue took place abroad.
