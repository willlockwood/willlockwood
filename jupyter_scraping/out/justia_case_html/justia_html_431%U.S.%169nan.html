The motion of James W. Jeffords, <em>et al.,</em> for leave to file a brief, as <em>amici curiae,</em> is granted.</p>\n<p>Appellant challenges the operation of certain provisions of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 351-361, and of the 1975 Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 31 (1970 ed., Supp. V), relating to increases in salaries paid members of Congress.  He asserts that the operation of these Acts violates Art. I, \xc2\xa7 1, and \xc2\xa7 6, cl. 1 (the Ascertainment Clause), of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On April 4, 1977, Congress passed an amendment to the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act. On April 12, the President signed that amendment into law.
