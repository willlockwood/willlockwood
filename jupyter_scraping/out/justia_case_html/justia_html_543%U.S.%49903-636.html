The District Court ultimately granted defendant former CDC officials summary judgment on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the policy\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality should be reviewed under the deferential standard articulated in <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html">482 U.

S. 483</a>, and refuses to resurrect it today.  The Court has previously applied a heightened standard of review in evaluating racial segregation in prisons.  <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/333/index.html">390 U. S. 333</a>.  The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here.  By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates \xe2\x80\x9cmay exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shaw</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 648.  Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without reliance on racial segregation.  In fact, the United States argues that it is possible to address prison security concerns through individualized consideration without using racial segregation, unless it is warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a serious threat of race-related violence.  As to transferees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated at least once, it is not clear why more individualized determinations are not possible.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court declines the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to make an exception to the categorical strict scrutiny rule and instead to apply <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deferential review standard on the ground that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy applies only in the prison context.  The Court has never applied the <em>Turner</em> standard\xe2\x80\x94which asks whether a regulation that burdens prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 fundamental rights is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate penological interests,\xe2\x80\x9d 482 U. S., at 89\xe2\x80\x94to racial classifications.  <em>Turner</em> itself did not involve such a classification, and it cast no doubt on <em>Lee</em>.  That is unsurprising, as the Court has applied the <em>Turner</em> test <em>only</em> to rights that are \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with proper incarceration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Overton</em> v. <em>Bazzetta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/126/index.html">539 U. S. 126</a>, 131.  The right not to be discriminated against based on one\xe2\x80\x99s race is not susceptible to <em>Turner</em>\'s logic because it is not a right that need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison administration.  On the contrary, compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on racial discrimination is not only consistent with proper prison administration, but also bolsters the legitimacy of the entire criminal justice system.  Cf. <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a>, 99.  Deference to the particular expertise of officials managing daily prison operations does not require a more relaxed standard here.  The Court did not relax the standard of review for racial classifications in prison in <em>Lee</em>, and it refuses to do so today.  Rather, it explicitly reaffirms that the \xe2\x80\x9cnecessities of prison security and discipline,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lee,</em> <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 334, are a compelling government interest justifying only those uses of race that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities, see, <em>e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a><em>,</em> 353.  Because <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard would allow prison officials to use race-based policies even when there are race-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the race-based policy does not in practice advance that goal, it is too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race.  Contrary to the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s protest, strict scrutiny will not render prison administrators unable to address legitimate problems of race-based violence in prisons.  On remand, the CDC will have the burden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with regard to new inmates as well as transferees.

We consider whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to that policy.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]retty close\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 1\xe2\x80\x936.  It cites numerous incidents of racial violence in CDC facilities and identifies five major prison gangs in the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders.  <em>Id</em>., at 2.  The CDC also notes that prison-gang culture is violent and murderous.  <em>Id</em>., at 3.  An associate warden testified that if race were not considered in making initial housing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflict in the cells and in the yard.  App. 215a.  Other prison officials also expressed their belief that violence and conflict would result if prisoners were not segregated.  See, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 305a\xe2\x80\x93306a.  The CDC claims that it must therefore segregate all inmates while it determines whether they pose a danger to others.  See Brief for Respondents 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilities\xe2\x80\x94dining areas, yards, and cells\xe2\x80\x94are fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Garrison Johnson is an African-American inmate in the custody of the CDC.  He has been incarcerated since 1987 and, during that time, has been housed at a number of California prison facilities.  Fourth Amended Complaint 3, Record, Doc. No. 78.  Upon his arrival at Folsom prison in 1987, and each time he was transferred to a new facility thereafter, Johnson was double-celled with another African-American inmate.  See <em>ibid</em>. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson filed a complaint <em>pro se</em> in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 24, 1995, alleging that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s reception-center housing policy violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by assigning him cellmates on the basis of his race.  He alleged that, from 1987 to 1991, former CDC Director James Rowland instituted and enforced an unconstitutional policy of housing inmates according to race.  Second Amended Complaint 2\xe2\x80\x934, Record, Doc. No. 21.  Johnson made the same allegations against former Director James Gomez for the period from 1991 until the filing of his complaint.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The District Court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Johnson had stated a claim for racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, 207 F.\xc2\xa03d 650, 655 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s housing policy.  He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a whole\xe2\x80\x94as it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After discovery, the parties moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was not clearly unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  321 F.\xc2\xa03d 791 (2003).  It held that the constitutionality of the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy should be reviewed under the deferential standard we articulated in <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)\xe2\x80\x94not strict scrutiny.  321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 798\xe2\x80\x93799.  Applying <em>Turner</em>, it held that Johnson had the burden of refuting the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense connection\xe2\x80\x9d between the policy and prison violence.  321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 802.  Though it believed this was a \xe2\x80\x9cclose case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 798, the Court of Appeals concluded that the policy survived <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 807.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals denied Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s petition for rehearing en banc.  Judge Ferguson, joined by three others, dissented on grounds that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision ignore[d] the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated and unequivocal command that all racial classifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny, and fail[ed] to recognize that [the] <em>Turner</em> analysis is inapplicable in cases, such as this one, in which the right asserted is not inconsistent with legitimate penological objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  336 F.\xc2\xa03d 1117 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We granted certiorari to decide which standard of review applies.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1217/index.html">540 U.

Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that racial classifications \xe2\x80\x9care narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbenign\xe2\x80\x9d racial classifications, such as race-conscious university admissions policies, see <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U.

S. 630</a>, 650 (1993).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasons for strict scrutiny are familiar.  Racial classifications raise special fears that they are motivated by an invidious purpose.  Thus, we have admonished time and again that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining \xe2\x80\xa6 what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>J.\xc2\xa0A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion).  We therefore apply strict scrutiny to <em>all</em> racial classifications to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98smoke out\xe2\x80\x99 illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CDC claims that its policy should be exempt from our categorical rule because it is \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, it \xe2\x80\x9cneither benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 16.  In other words, strict scrutiny should not apply because all prisoners are \xe2\x80\x9cequally\xe2\x80\x9d segregated.  The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s argument ignores our repeated command that \xe2\x80\x9cracial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shaw</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 651.

In <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/333/index.html">390 U. S. 333</a> (1968) <em>(per curiam),</em> we upheld a three-judge court\xe2\x80\x99s decision striking down Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s policy of segregation in its prisons.  <em>Id</em>., at 333\xe2\x80\x93334.  Alabama had argued that desegregation would undermine prison security and discipline, <em>id</em>., at 334, but we rejected that contention.

(emphasis added).  The concurring Justices emphasized that they were \xe2\x80\x9cunwilling to assume that state or local prison authorities might mistakenly regard such an explicit pronouncement as evincing any dilution of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s firm commitment to the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here, where prison officials cite racial violence as the reason for their policy.  As we have recognized in the past, racial classifications \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to <em>incite racial hostility</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shaw</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 643 (citing <em>J.\xc2\xa0A. Croson Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 493 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added)).  Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible that prison officials will breed further hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions.

Indeed, the United States argues, based on its experience with the BOP, that it is possible to address \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns of prison security through individualized consideration without the use of racial segregation, unless warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a race riot or other serious threat of race-related violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 24.

It is not a right that need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison administration.  On the contrary, compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on racial discrimination is not only consistent with proper prison administration, but also bolsters the legitimacy of the entire criminal justice system.  Race discrimination is \xe2\x80\x9cespecially pernicious in the administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/545/index.html">443 U.

When government officials are permitted to use race as a proxy for gang membership and violence without demonstrating a compelling government interest and proving that their means are narrowly tailored, society as a whole suffers.  For similar reasons, we have not used <em>Turner</em> to evaluate Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment in prison.  We judge violations of that Amendment under the \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x9d standard, rather than <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d standard.

See <em>Batson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 89\xe2\x80\x9396.  Similarly, in the redistricting context, despite the traditional deference given to States when they design their electoral districts, we have subjected redistricting plans to strict scrutiny when States draw district lines based predominantly on race.

But <em>Turner </em>is too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race.  <em>Turner</em> requires only that the policy be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate penological interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S., at 89.  <em>Turner</em> would allow prison officials to use race-based policies even when there are race-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the race-based policy does not in practice advance that goal.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 803 (case below) (reasoning that, under <em>Turner</em>, the Court of Appeals did \xe2\x80\x9cnot have to agree that the policy actually advances the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest, but only [that] \xe2\x80\x98defendants might reasonably have thought that the policy would advance its interests\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90 (warning that <em>Turner</em> is not a \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive alternative test\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, in Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 world, prison officials could segregate visiting areas on the ground that racial mixing would cause unrest in the racially charged prison atmosphere.  Under <em>Turner</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he prisoner would have to prove that there would <em>not</em> be a riot.  [But] [i]t is certainly \xe2\x80\x98plausible\xe2\x80\x99 that such a riot could ensue: our society, as well as our prisons, contains enough racists that almost any interracial interaction could potentially lead to conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1120 (case below) (Ferguson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Indeed, under Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 view, there is no obvious limit to permissible segregation in prisons.  It is not readily apparent why, if segregation in reception centers is justified, segregation in the dining halls, yards, and general housing areas is not also permissible.  Any of these areas could be the potential site of racial violence.  If Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 approach were to carry the day, even the blanket segregation policy struck down in <em>Lee</em> might stand a chance of survival if prison officials simply asserted that it was necessary to prison management.  We therefore reject the <em>Turner </em>standard for racial classifications in prisons because it would make rank discrimination too easy to defend.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CDC protests that strict scrutiny will handcuff prison administrators and render them unable to address legitimate problems of race-based violence in prisons.  See also <em>post</em>, at 9, 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Not so.  Strict scrutiny is not \xe2\x80\x9cstrict in theory, but fatal in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, 515 U.

S., at 326\xe2\x80\x93327 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it\xe2\x80\x9d).  Strict scrutiny does not preclude the ability of prison officials to address the compelling interest in prison safety.  Prison administrators, however, will have to demonstrate that any race-based policies are narrowly tailored to that end.  See <em>id.</em>, at 327  (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that strict scrutiny applies \xe2\x80\x9csays nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 229\xe2\x80\x93230.  At this juncture, no such determination has been made.  On remand, the CDC will have the burden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with regard to new inmates as well as transferees.  Prisons are dangerous places, and the special circumstances they present may justify racial classifications in some contexts.  Such circumstances can be considered in applying strict scrutiny, which is designed to take relevant differences into account.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not decide whether the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy violates the Equal Protection Clause.

CALIFORNIA<br/>\n543 U. S. ____ (2005)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 03-636<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">GARRISON S. JOHNSON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> \nCALIFORNIA et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[February 23, 2005]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987).  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s segregation policy[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policy\xe2\x80\x99s logic, an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to <em>all </em>new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy, for example, two car thieves of different races\xe2\x80\x94neither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matter\xe2\x80\x94would be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They won\xe2\x80\x99t even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  It\xe2\x80\x99s very culturally heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 189a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSuch musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Palmore</em> v. <em>Sidoti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/429/index.html">466 U. S. 429</a>, 432 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cClassifying persons according to their race is more likely to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns; the race, not the person, dictates the category\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Watson</em> v. <em>Memphis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/526/index.html">373 U. S. 526</a>, 536 (1963) (rejecting the city\xe2\x80\x99s plea for delay in desegregating public facilities when \xe2\x80\x9cneither the asserted fears of violence and tumult nor the asserted inability to preserve the peace was demonstrated at trial to be anything more than personal speculations or vague disquietudes of city officials\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that California\xe2\x80\x99s policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An <em>amici</em> brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as <em>Amici Curiae </em>19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States\xe2\x80\x99 policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as California\xe2\x80\x99s, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the State\xe2\x80\x99s most violent criminal offenders, including \xe2\x80\x9cvalidated\xe2\x80\x9d gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250\xe2\x80\x93300 inmates, \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern Hispanic\xe2\x80\x9d gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s <em>post hoc</em>, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmates\xe2\x80\x94much less a <em>pattern </em>of such violence\xe2\x80\x94that prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See<em> Lee </em>v.<em> Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/333/index.html">390 U. S. 333</a>, 334 (1968) (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s decision to apply its segregation policy to <em>all </em>of its reception centers, without regard for each center\xe2\x80\x99s security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.  Distressingly, this is not so: There is no evidence that the CDC has ever experimented with, or even carefully considered, race-neutral methods of achieving its goals.  That the policy is unwritten reflects, I think, the evident lack of deliberation that preceded its creation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmate\xe2\x80\x99s risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to another\xe2\x80\x94who represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policy\xe2\x80\x94the CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  For new inmates, assignments can be based on their presentence reports, which contain information about offense conduct, criminal record, and personal history\xe2\x80\x94including any available information about gang affiliations.  In fact, state law requires the county probation officer to transmit a presentence report to the CDC along with an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s commitment papers.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71203c (West 2004); Cal. Rule of Court 4.411(d) (Criminal Cases) (West Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the rich information available in these records, the CDC considers these records only rarely in assigning inmates to cells in the reception centers.  The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s primary explanation for this is administrative inefficiency\xe2\x80\x94the records, it says, simply do not arrive in time.  The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s counsel conceded at oral argument that presentence reports \xe2\x80\x9chave a fair amount of information,\xe2\x80\x9d but she stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cin California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not.  It follows some period of time later from the county.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  Despite the state-law requirement to the contrary, counsel informed the Court that the counties are not preparing the presentence reports \xe2\x80\x9cin a timely fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Similarly, with regard to transferees, counsel stated that their prison records do not arrive at the reception centers in time to make cell assignments.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.  Even if such inefficiencies might explain a temporary expedient in some cases, they surely do not justify a system-wide policy.  When the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in administrative convenience is pitted against the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on racial segregation, the latter must prevail.  When there has been no \xe2\x80\x9cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the [desired goal],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 339 (2003), and when \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, easy alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d are available, <em>Turner, </em>482 U. S., at 90, the conclusion that CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is unconstitutional is inescapable regardless of the standard of review that the Court chooses to apply.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.  Race is an unreliable and necessarily underinclusive predictor of violence.  Without the inmate-specific information found in the records, there is a risk that corrections officials will, for example, house together inmates of the same race who are nevertheless members of rival gangs, such as the Bloods and Crips.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, while I agree that a remand is appropriate for a resolution of the issue of qualified immunity, I respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to decide, on the basis of the record before us, that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is unconstitutional.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.  At the centers, inmates are housed either in dormitories, double cells, or single cells (of which there are few).  Under the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been \xe2\x80\x9craised with Crips,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 184a, the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In explaining why it cannot prescreen new inmates, the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s brief all but concedes that segregating transferred inmates is unnecessary.  See Brief for Respondents 42 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the officials had all of the necessary information to assess the inmates\xe2\x80\x99 violence potential when the inmates arrived, perhaps a different practice could be used.  But unlike the federal system, where the inmates are generally in federal custody from the moment they are arrested, state inmates are in county custody until they are convicted and later transferred to the custody of the CDC\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because the <em>Turner </em>factors boil down to a tailoring test, and I conclude that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is, at best, an \xe2\x80\x9cexaggerated response\xe2\x80\x9d to its asserted security concerns, see <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U. S. 78</a>, 90 (1987), I find it unnecessary to address specifically the other factors, such as whether new and transferred inmates have \xe2\x80\x9calternative means\xe2\x80\x9d of exercising their right to equal protection during their period of housing segregation, <em>id., </em>at 89.  Indeed, this case demonstrates once again that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]ow a court describes its standard of review when a prison regulation infringes fundamental constitutional rights often has far less consequences for the inmates than the actual showing that the court demands of the State in order to uphold the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 100 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy may be counterproductive in other ways.  For example, an official policy of segregation may initiate new arrivals into a corrosive culture of prison racial segregation, lending credence to the view that members of other races are to be feared and that racial alliances are necessary.  While integrated cells encourage inmates to gain valuable cross-racial experiences, segregated cells may well facilitate the formation of race-based gangs.

On the one hand, as the Court stresses, this Court has said that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>all</em> racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gratz</em> v. <em>Bollinger, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/244/index.html">539 U.

On the other, this Court has no less categorically said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [relaxed] standard of review we adopted in <em>Turner</em> [v. <em>Safley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/78/index.html">482 U.

The Constitution has always demanded less within the prison walls.  Time and again, even when faced with constitutional rights no less \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d than the right to be free from state-sponsored racial discrimination, we have deferred to the reasonable judgments of officials experienced in running this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s prisons.  There is good reason for such deference in this case.  California oversees roughly 160,000 inmates, in prisons that have been a breeding ground for some of the most violent prison gangs in America\xe2\x80\x94all of them organized along racial lines.  In that atmosphere, California racially segregates a portion of its inmates, in a part of its prisons, for brief periods of up to 60 days, until the State can arrange permanent housing.  The majority is concerned with sparing inmates the indignity and stigma of racial discrimination.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  California is concerned with their safety and saving their lives.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand this case, one must understand just how limited the policy at issue is.  That requires more factual background than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provides.  Petitioner Garrison Johnson is a black inmate in the California Department of Corrections (CDC), currently serving his sentence for murder, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon.  App. 255a\xe2\x80\x93256a, 259a.  Johnson began serving his sentence in June 1987 at the California Institution for Men in Chino, California.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79a, 264a.  Since that time he has been transferred to a number of other facilities within the CDC.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79a\xe2\x80\x9382a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When an inmate like Johnson is admitted into the California prison system or transferred between the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s institutions, he is housed initially for a brief period\xe2\x80\x94usually no more than 60 days\xe2\x80\x94in one of California\xe2\x80\x99s prison reception centers for men.  <em>Id.</em>, at 303a\xe2\x80\x93305a.

In 2003, the centers processed more than 40,000 newly admitted inmates, almost 72,000 inmates returned from parole, over 14,000 inmates admitted for other reasons, and some portion of the 254,000 inmates who were transferred from one prison to another.  California Dept. of Corrections, Movement of Prison Population 3 (2003) (hereinafter Movement of Prison Population).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the reception center, prison officials have limited information about an inmate, \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly if he has never been housed in any CDC facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 303a.  The inmate therefore is classified so that prison officials can place the inmate in appropriate permanent housing.  During this process, the CDC evaluates the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cphysical, mental and emotional health.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The CDC also reviews the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history and record in jail to assess his security needs and classification level.  <em>Id.</em>, at 304a.  Finally, the CDC investigates whether the inmate has any enemies in prison.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This process determines the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate housing placement and has nothing to do with race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the process is underway, the CDC houses the inmate in a one-person cell, a two-person cell, or a dormitory.  <em>Id.,</em> at 305a.  The few single cells available at reception centers are reserved for inmates who present special security problems, including those convicted of especially heinous crimes or those in need of protective custody.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, CDC Operations Manual \xc2\xa761010.11.3.  At the other end of the spectrum, lower risk inmates are assigned to dormitories.  App. 189a\xe2\x80\x93190a.  Placement in either a single cell or a dormitory has nothing to do with race, except that prison officials attempt to maintain a racial balance within each dormitory.  <em>Id.</em>, at 250a.  Inmates placed in single cells or dormitories lead fully integrated lives: The CDC does not distinguish based on race at any of its facilities when it comes to jobs, meals, yard and recreation time, or vocational and educational assignments.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet some prisoners, like Johnson, neither require confinement in a single cell nor may be safely housed in a dormitory.  The CDC houses these prisoners in double cells during the 60-day period.  In pairing cellmates, race is indisputably the predominant factor.  <em>Id.</em>, at 305a, 309a.  California\xe2\x80\x99s reason is simple: Its prisons are dominated by violent gangs.  Brief for Respondents 1\xe2\x80\x935.

See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the State, housing inmates in double cells without regard to race threatens not only prison discipline, but also the physical safety of inmates and staff.  App.  305a\xe2\x80\x93306a, 310a\xe2\x80\x93311a.  That is because double cells are especially dangerous.  The risk of racial violence in public areas of prisons is high, and the tightly confined, private conditions of cells hazard even more violence.  Prison staff cannot see into the cells without going up to them, and inmates can cover the windows to prevent the staff from seeing inside the cells.  <em>Id.</em>, at 306a.  The risk of violence caused by this privacy is grave, for inmates are confined to their cells for much of the day.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>id.</em>, at 187a\xe2\x80\x93188a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, while race is the predominant factor in pairing cellmates, it is hardly the only one.  After dividing this subset of inmates based on race, the CDC further divides them based on geographic or national origin.  As an example, Hispanics from Northern and Southern California are not housed together in reception centers, because they often belong to rival gangs\xe2\x80\x94La Nuestra Familia and the Mexican Mafia, respectively.  <em>Id.</em>, at 185a.  Likewise, Chinese and Japanese inmates are not housed together, nor are Cambodians, Filipinos, Laotians, or Vietnamese.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189a.  In addition to geographic and national origin, prison officials consider a host of other factors, including inmates\xe2\x80\x99 age, mental health, medical needs, criminal history, and gang affiliation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 304a, 309a.  For instance, when Johnson was admitted in 1987, he was a member of the Crips, a black street gang.  <em>Id.</em>, at 93a.  He was therefore ineligible to be housed with\nnonblack inmates.  <em>Id.</em>, at 183a; Brief for Respondents 12, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, while prison officials consider race in assigning inmates to double cells, the record shows that inmates are not necessarily housed with other inmates of the same race during that 60-day period.  When a Hispanic inmate affiliated with the Crips asked to be housed at the reception center with a black inmate, for example, prison administrators granted his request.  App. at 183a\xe2\x80\x93184a, 199a.  Such requests are routinely granted after the 60-day period, when prison officials complete the classification process and transfer an inmate from the reception center to a permanent placement at that prison or another one.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 311a\xe2\x80\x93312a.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Traditionally, federal courts rarely involved themselves in the administration of state prisons, \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[ing] a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Procunier</em> v. <em>Martinez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/index.html">416 U.

For most of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, only law-abiding citizens could claim the cover of the Constitution: Upon conviction and incarceration, defendants forfeited their constitutional rights and possessed instead only those rights that the State chose to extend them.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis proceeded in two steps.  First, the Court recognized that prisoners are not entirely without constitutional rights.  As proof, it listed certain constitutional rights retained by prisoners, including the right to be \xe2\x80\x9cprotected against invidious racial discrimination . . . , <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/333/index.html"></a><a href="/us/390/333/index.html">390 U.

Second, the Court concluded that for prison administrators rather than courts to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 89 (quoting <em>Jones</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 128), courts should uphold prison regulations that impinge on those constitutional rights if they reasonably relate to legitimate penological interests, 482 U. S., at 89.  Nowhere did the Court suggest that <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s right to be free from racial discrimination was immune from <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review.  To the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e made quite clear that the standard of review we adopted in <em>Turner</em> applies to <em>all</em> circumstances in which the needs of prison administration implicate constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harper,</em> 494 U. S., at 224 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with that understanding, this Court has applied <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard to a host of constitutional claims by prisoners, regardless of the standard of review that would apply outside prison walls.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And this Court has adhered to <em>Turner</em> despite being urged to adopt different standards of review based on the constitutional provision at issue.  See <em>Harper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 224 (<em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard of review \xe2\x80\x9cappl[ies] in all cases in which a prisoner asserts that a prison regulation violates the Constitution, <em>not just those in which the prisoner invokes the First Amendment</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Lone</em> v. <em>Estate of Shabazz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/342/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/342/index.html">482 U.

Our steadfast adherence makes sense: If <em>Turner</em> is our accommodation of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s demands to those of prison administration, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, we should apply it uniformly to prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to their conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After all, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s claims, even more than other claims to which we have applied <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test, implicate <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  In fact, in a passage that bears repeating, the <em>Turner</em> Court explained precisely why deference to the judgments of California\xe2\x80\x99s prison officials is necessary:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSubjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration.  The rule would also distort the decisionmaking process, for every administrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way of solving the problem at hand.  Courts inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what constitutes the best solution to every administrative problem, thereby unnecessarily perpetuating the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of prison administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U.

In fact, there is no more \xe2\x80\x9cintractable problem\xe2\x80\x9d inside America\xe2\x80\x99s prisons than racial violence, which is driven by race-based prison gangs.

See Brief for National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, Inc. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12.

In fact, street gangs are often just an extension of prison gangs, their \xe2\x80\x9cfoot soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d on the outside.  <em>Ibid.;</em> Willens, Structure, Content and the Exigencies of War: American Prison Law After Twenty-Five Years 1962\xe2\x80\x931987, 37 Am.

And with gang membership on the rise, the percentage of prisoners affiliated with prison gangs more than doubled in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem of prison gangs is not unique to California,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] but California has a history like no other.  There are at least five major gangs in this country\xe2\x80\x94the Aryan Brotherhood, the Black Guerrilla Family, the Mexican Mafia, La Nuestra Familia, and the Texas Syndicate\xe2\x80\x94all of which originated in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Unsurprisingly, then, California has the largest number of gang-related inmates of any correctional system in the country, including the Federal Government.  Carlson 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As their very names suggest, prison gangs like the Aryan Brotherhood and the Black Guerrilla Family organize themselves along racial lines, and these gangs perpetuate hate and violence.  Irwin 182, 184.  Interracial murders and assaults among inmates perpetrated by these gangs are common.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  And, again, that brutality is particularly severe in California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Walker</em> v. <em>Gomez</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 969, 971 (CA9 2004) (describing \xe2\x80\x9chistory of significant racial tension and violence\xe2\x80\x9d at Calipatria State Prison); <em>id.</em>, at 979\xe2\x80\x93980 (Rymer, J., dissenting) (same); App. 297a\xe2\x80\x93299a (describing 2-year span at Pelican Bay Prison, during which there were no fewer than nine major riots that left at least one inmate dead and many more wounded).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is against this backdrop of pervasive racial violence that California racially segregates inmates in the reception centers\xe2\x80\x99 double cells, for brief periods of up to 60 days, until such time as the State can assign permanent housing.  Viewed in that context and in light of the four factors enunciated in <em>Turner</em>, California\xe2\x80\x99s policy is constitutional: The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest; alternative means of exercising the restricted right remain open to inmates; racially integrating double cells might negatively impact prison inmates, staff, and administrators; and there are no obvious, easy alternatives to the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the policy is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.  <em>Turner</em>, 482 U. S., at 89.  The protection of inmates and staff is undeniably a legitimate penological interest.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Wolfish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/index.html"></a><a href="/us/441/520/index.html">441 U. S. 520</a>, 546\xe2\x80\x93547 (1979).  The evidence shows, and Johnson has never contested, that the objective of California\xe2\x80\x99s policy is reducing violence among the inmates and against the staff.  No cells are designated for, nor are special privileges afforded to, any racial group.  App. 188a, 305a.  Because prison administrators use race as a factor in making initial housing assignments \xe2\x80\x9csolely on the basis of [its] potential implications for prison security,\xe2\x80\x9d the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s cell assignment practice is neutral.  <em>Thornburgh</em> v. <em>Abbott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/401/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/401/index.html">490 U. S. 401</a>, 415 (1989); <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s policy bears a valid, rational connection to this interest.  The racial component to prison violence is impossible for prison administrators to ignore.  Johnson himself testified that he is afraid of violence\xe2\x80\x94based solely on the color of his skin.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In combating that violence, an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s arrival or transfer into a new prison setting is a critical time for inmate and staff alike.  The policy protects an inmate from other prisoners, and they from him, while prison officials gather more information, including his gang affiliation, about his compatibility with other inmates.  App. 249a.  This connection between racial violence and the policy makes it far from \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary or irrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, Johnson concedes that it would be perfectly constitutional for California to take account of race \xe2\x80\x9cas part of an overall analysis of proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts existing in that prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.  But that is precisely what California does.  It takes into account a host of factors in addition to race: geographic or national origin, age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, criminal history, and, of course, gang affiliation.  <em>Supra</em>, at 4.  California does not simply assign inmates to double cells in the reception centers based on race\xe2\x80\x94it also separates <em>intra</em>racially (for example, northern from southern Hispanics or violent from nonviolent offenders).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, alternative means of exercising the restricted right remain open to inmates like Johnson.  <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90.  The CDC submits, and Johnson does not contest, that all other facets of prison life are fully integrated: work, vocational, and educational assignments; dining halls; and exercise yards and recreational facilities.  App. 250a.  And after a brief detention period at the reception center, inmates may select their own cellmates regardless of race in the absence of overriding security concerns.  <em>Id.</em>, at 311a\xe2\x80\x93312a.  Simply put, Johnson has spent, and will continue to spend, the vast bulk of his sentence free from any limitation on the race of his cellmate.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, Johnson fails to establish that the accommodation he seeks\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, assigning inmates to double cells without regard to race\xe2\x80\x94would not significantly impact prison personnel, other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources.  <em>Harper</em>, 494 U. S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227; <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90.  Prison staff cannot see into the double cells without going up to them, and inmates can cover the windows so that staff cannot see inside the cells at all.  App. 306a.  Because of the limited number of staff to oversee the many cells, it \xe2\x80\x9cwould be very difficult to assist inmates if the staff were needed in several places at one time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Coordinated gang attacks against nongang cellmates could leave prison officials unable to respond effectively.  In any event, diverting prison resources to monitor cells disrupts services elsewhere.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then, too, fights in the cells are likely to spill over to the exercise yards and common areas.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.</em>, at 187a.  As <em>Turner</em> made clear: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen accommodation of an asserted right will have a significant \xe2\x80\x98ripple effect\xe2\x80\x99 on fellow inmates or on prison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of corrections officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S., at 90; see also <em>White</em> v. <em>Morris</em>, 832 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1129, 1130 (SD Ohio 1993) (racially integrated double celling contributed to a race riot in which 10 people were murdered).  California prison officials are united in the view that racially integrating double cells in the reception centers would lead to serious violence.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  This is precisely the sort of testimony that the Court found persuasive in <em>Turner</em> itself.  <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 92.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Johnson has not shown that there are \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, easy alternatives\xe2\x80\x9d to the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy.  <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90.  Johnson contends that, for newly admitted inmates, prison officials need only look to the information available in the presentence report that must accompany a convict to prison.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71203(c) (West 2004); Cal. Rules of Court, Criminal Cases, Rule 4.411(d) (West 2004).  But prison officials already do this to the extent that they can.  Indeed, gang affiliation, not race, is the first factor in determining initial housing assignments.  App. 315a.  Race becomes the predominant factor only because gang affiliation is often not known, especially with regard to newly admitted inmates.  As the Court of Appeals pointed out: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is little chance that inmates will be forthcoming about their past violent episodes or criminal gang activity so as to provide an accurate and dependable picture of the inmate.\xe2\x80\x9d  321 F.\xc2\xa03d 791, 806 (CA9 2003); see also App. 185a, 189a.  Even if the CDC had the manpower and resources to prescreen the more than 40,000 new inmates it receives yearly, leafing through presentence reports would not tell prison officials\nwhat they need to know.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson presents a closer case with regard to the segregation of prisoners whom the CDC transfers between facilities.  As I understand it, California has less need to segregate prisoners about whom it already knows a great deal (since they have undergone the initial classification process and been housed for some period of time).  However, this does not inevitably mean that racially integrating transferred inmates, while obvious and easy, is a true alternative.  For instance, an inmate may have affiliated with a gang since the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s last official assessment, or his past lack of racial violence may have been due to the absence of close confinement with members of other races.  The CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy does not appear to arise from laziness or neglect; California is a leader in institutional intelligence-gathering.  See Carlson 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe CDC devotes 75 intelligence staff to gathering and verifying inmate-related information,\xe2\x80\x9d both in prisons and on the streets).  In\nshort, applying the policy to transfers is not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary or irrational,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring that we set aside the considered contrary judgment of prison administrators.  <em>Turner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 89\xe2\x80\x9390.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority claims that strict scrutiny is the applicable standard of review based on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents and its general skepticism of racial classifications.

In so doing, the District Court rejected any notion that \xe2\x80\x9cconsideration[s] of prison security or discipline\xe2\x80\x9d justified the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and permanent segregation of the races in all the Alabama penal facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 331.  However, the District Court noted \xe2\x80\x9cthat in some isolated instances prison security and discipline necessitates segregation of the races for a limited period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (footnote omitted).  It provided only one example\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98tank\xe2\x80\x99 used in \xe2\x80\xa6 large municipal jails where intoxicated persons are placed upon their initial incarceration and kept until they become sober,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 331, n.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x94and the court left unmentioned why it would have been necessary to separate drunk whites from blacks on a Birmingham Saturday night.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court, in a <em>per curiam</em>, one-paragraph opinion, affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  It found \xe2\x80\x9cunexceptionable\xe2\x80\x9d not only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s general rule that wholesale segregation of penal facilities was unconstitutional, but also the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9callowance for the necessities of prison security and discipline.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lee</em>, 390 U. S., at 334.  Indeed, Justices Black, Harlan, and Stewart concurred</p>\n<p align="left"> \xe2\x80\x9cto make explicit something that is left to be gathered only by implication from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  This is that prison authorities have the right, acting in good faith and in particularized circumstances, to take into account racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and jails.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThose Justices were \xe2\x80\x9cunwilling to assume\xe2\x80\x9d that such an \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit pronouncement [would] evinc[e] any dilution of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s firm commitment to the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Lee</em> said nothing about the applicable standard of review, for there was no need.  Surely Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale segregation of its prisons was unconstitutional even under the more deferential standard of review that applies within prisons.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s brief, <em>per curiam</em> opinion in <em>Lee</em> simply cannot bear the weight or interpretation the majority places on it.  See <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.</em> v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/18/index.html">513 U. S. 18</a>, 24 (1994)  (noting \xe2\x80\x9cour customary skepticism toward <em>per curiam</em> dispositions that lack the reasoned consideration of a full opinion\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Jordan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/index.html">415 U. S. 651</a>, 670\xe2\x80\x93671 (1974).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet even if <em>Lee</em> had announced a heightened standard of review for prison policies that pertain to race, <em>Lee</em> also carved out an exception to the standard that California\xe2\x80\x99s policy would certainly satisfy.  As the <em>Lee</em> concurrence explained without objection, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exception for \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessities of prison security and discipline\xe2\x80\x9d meant that \xe2\x80\x9cprison authorities have the right, acting in <em>good faith</em> and in <em>particularized circumstances</em>, to take into account racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and jails.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lee</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 334 (opinion of Black, Harlan, and Stewart, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s policy\xe2\x80\x94which is a far cry from the wholesale segregation at issue in <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x94would fall squarely within <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exception.  Johnson has never argued that California\xe2\x80\x99s policy is motivated by anything other than a desire to protect inmates and staff.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the policy is evident: It applies only to new inmates and transfers, only in a handful of prisons, only to double cells, and only then for a period of no more than two months.  In the name of following a test that <em>Lee\n</em>did not create, the majority opts for a more demanding standard of review than <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language even arguably supports.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority heavily relies on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all racial classifications [imposed by government] \xe2\x80\xa6 must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (quoting <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em>, 515 U. S., at 227).  <em>Adarand </em>has nothing to do with this case.  <em>Adarand</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9call racial classifications\xe2\x80\x9d are subject to strict scrutiny addressed the contention that classifications favoring rather than disfavoring blacks are exempt.  <em>Id.</em>, at 226\xe2\x80\x93227; accord, <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 353  (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  None of these statements overruled, <em>sub silentio</em>, <em>Turner</em> and its progeny, especially since the Court has repeatedly held that constitutional demands are diminished in the unique context of prisons.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Harper,</em> 494 U. S., at 224; <em>Abbott,</em> 490 U. S., at 407; <em>Turner</em>, 482 U. S., at 85; see also <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Fall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/507/index.html">266 U. S. 507</a>, 511 (1925) (\xe2\x80\x9cQuestions\nwhich merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority offers various other reasons for applying strict scrutiny.  None is persuasive.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s main reason is that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-relationship test [applies] <em>only</em> to rights that are \xe2\x80\x98inconsistent with proper incarceration.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (quoting <em>Overton</em> v. <em>Bazzetta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/126/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/126/index.html">539 U. S. 126</a>, 131 (2003)).  According to the majority, the question is thus whether a right \xe2\x80\x9cneed necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  This inconsistency-with-proper-prison-administration test begs the question at the heart of this case.  For a court to know whether any particular right is inconsistent with proper prison administration, it must have some implicit notion of what a proper prison ought to look like and how it ought to be administered.  <em>Overton</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 139 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  But the very issue in this case is whether such second-guessing is permissible.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s test eviscerates <em>Turner</em>.  Inquiring whether a given right is consistent with \xe2\x80\x9cproper prison administration\xe2\x80\x9d calls for precisely the sort of judgments that <em>Turner</em> said courts were ill equipped to make.  In none of the cases in which the Court deferred to the judgments of prison officials under <em>Turner</em> did it examine whether \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d prison security and discipline permitted greater speech or associational rights (<em>Abbott</em>, <em>supra</em>; <em>Shaw</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/223/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/223/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/223/index.html">532 U. S. 223</a>; and <em>Overton, supra</em>); expanded access to the courts (<em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/343/index.html">518 U. S. 343</a> (1996)); broader freedom from bodily restraint (<em>Harper</em>, <em>supra</em>); or additional free exercise rights (<em>O\xe2\x80\x99Lone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/342/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/342/index.html">482 U. S. 342</a>).  The Court has steadfastly refused to undertake the threshold standard-of-review inquiry that <em>Turner</em> settled, and that the majority today resurrects.  And with good reason: As <em>Turner</em> pointed out, these judgments are better left in the first instance to the officials who run our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s prisons, not to the judges who run its courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In place of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual deference, the majority gives conclusive force to its own guesswork about \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d prison administration.  It hypothesizes that California\xe2\x80\x99s policy might incite, rather than diminish, racial hostility.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; see also <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, and n. 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s speculations are implausible.  New arrivals have a strong interest in promptly convincing other inmates of their willingness to use violent force.  See Brief for National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (citing commentary and congressional findings); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Santiago</em>, 46 F.\xc2\xa03d 885, 888 (CA9 1995) (describing one Hispanic inmate\xe2\x80\x99s murder of another in order to join the Mexican Mafia); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Silverstein</em>, 732 F.\xc2\xa02d 1338, 1341 (CA7 1984) (prospective members of the Aryan Brotherhood must \xe2\x80\x9cmake bones,\xe2\x80\x9d or commit a murder, to be eligible for membership).  In any event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s guesswork falls far short of the compelling showing needed to overcome the deference we owe to prison\nadministrators.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority contends that the Court \xe2\x80\x9c[has] put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa01, and \xe2\x80\x9c[has] refused to defer to state officials\xe2\x80\x99 judgments on race in other areas where those officials traditionally exercise substantial discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Yet two Terms ago, in upholding the University of Michigan Law School\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative-action program, this Court deferred to the judgment by the law school\xe2\x80\x99s faculty and administrators on their need for diversity in the student body.  See <em>Grutter,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 328  (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Law School\xe2\x80\x99s educational judgment that \xe2\x80\xa6 diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer\xe2\x80\x9d).  Deference would seem all the more warranted in the prison context, for whatever the Court knows of administering educational institutions, it knows much less about administering penal ones.  The potential consequences of second-guessing the judgments of prison administrators are also much more severe.  See <em>White</em> v. <em>Morris</em>, 832 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1129, 1130 (SD Ohio 1993) (racially integrated double celling that resulted from federal consent decree was a factor in the worst prison riot in Ohio history).  More important, as I have explained, the Court has recognized that the typically exacting review it applies to restrictions on fundamental rights must be relaxed in the unique context of prisons.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Harper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 224; <em>Abbott,</em> 490 U. S., at 407; <em>Turner</em>, 482 U. S., at 85.  The majority cannot fall back on the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s usual demands, because those demands have always been lessened inside the prison walls.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also mentions that California\xe2\x80\x99s policy may be the only one of its kind, as virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without racially segregating inmates.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  This is both irrelevant and doubtful.  It is irrelevant because the number of States that have followed California\xe2\x80\x99s lead matters not to the applicable standard of review (the only issue the Court today decides), but to whether California satisfies whatever standard applies, a question the majority leaves to be addressed on remand.  In other words, the uniqueness of California\xe2\x80\x99s policy might show whether the policy is reasonable or narrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x94but deciding whether to apply <em>Turner</em> or strict scrutiny in the first instance must depend on something else, like the majority\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistency-with-proper-prison-administration test.  The commonness of California\xe2\x80\x99s housing policy is further irrelevant because strict scrutiny now applies to all claims of racial discrimination in prisons, regardless of whether the policies being challenged are unusual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is doubtful, because at least two other States apply similar policies to newly admitted inmates.  Both Oklahoma and Texas, like California, assign newly admitted inmates to racially segregated cells in their prison reception centers.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The similarity is not surprising: States like California and Texas have historically had the most severe problems with prison gangs.  However, even States with less severe problems maintain that policies like California\xe2\x80\x99s are necessary to deal with race-related prison violence.  See Brief of the States of Utah, Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Dakota as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16.  Relatedly, 10.3% of all wardens at maximum security facilities in the United States report that their inmates are assigned to racially segregated cells\xe2\x80\x94apparently on a <em>permanent</em> basis.  M. Henderson, F. Cullen, L. Carroll, &amp; W. Feinberg, Race, Rights, and Order in Prison: A National Survey of Wardens on the Racial Integration of Prison Cells, 80 Prison J. 295, 304 (Sept. 2000).  In the same survey, 4.3% of the wardens report that their States have an official policy against racially integrating male inmates in cells.  <em>Id.</em>, at 302.  Presumably, for the remainder of prisons in which inmates are assigned to racially segregated cells, that policy is the result of discretionary decisions by wardens rather than of official state directives.  <em>Ibid. </em> In any event, the ongoing debate about the best way to reduce racial violence in prisons should not be resolved by judicial decree: It is the job \xe2\x80\x9cof prison administrators \xe2\x80\xa6 and not the courts, to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em>, 433 U. S., at 128.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also observes that we have already carved out an exception to <em>Turner</em> for Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment in prison.  See <em>Hope</em> v. <em>Pelzer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a>, 738 (2002).  In that context, we have held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] prison official\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98deliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x99 to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html">511 U. S. 825</a>, 828 (1994).  Setting aside whether claims challenging inmates\xe2\x80\x99 conditions of confinement should be cognizable under the Eighth Amendment at all, see <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>McMillian,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/1/index.html">503 U. S. 1</a>, 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (1992) (Thomas, J., dissenting), the \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x9d standard does not bolster the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  If anything, that standard is <em>more</em> deferential to the judgments of prison administrators than <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-relationship test: It subjects prison officials to liability only when they are subjectively aware of the risk to the inmate, and they fail to take reasonable measures to abate the risk.  <em>Farmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 847.  It certainly does not demonstrate the wisdom of an exception that imposes a heightened standard of review on the actions of prison officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision subjects prison officials to competing and perhaps conflicting demands.  In this case, California prison officials have uniformly averred that random double-celling poses a substantial risk of serious harm to the celled inmates.  App. 245a\xe2\x80\x93246a, 251a.  If California assigned inmates to double cells without regard to race, knowing full well that violence might result, that would seem the very definition of deliberate indifference.  See <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Prunty</em>, 249 F.\xc2\xa03d 862, 864\xe2\x80\x93865 (CA9 2001) (prisoner alleged an Eighth Amendment violation because administrators had <em>failed</em> to consider race when releasing inmates into the yards); <em>Jensen</em> v. <em>Clarke</em>, 94 F.\xc2\xa03d 1191, 1201, 1204 (CA8 1996) (court held that random double celling by prison officials constituted deliberate indifference, and affirmed an injunction and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the officials).  Nor would a victimized inmate need to prove that prison officials had anticipated any particular attack; it would be sufficient that prison officials had ignored a dangerous condition that was chronic and ongoing\xe2\x80\x94like interracial housing in closely confined quarters within prisons dominated by racial gangs.  <em>Farmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  Under <em>Farmer</em>, prison officials could have been ordered to take account of the very thing to which they may now have to turn a blind eye: inmates\xe2\x80\x99 race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority presents a parade of horribles designed to show that applying the <em>Turner</em> standard would grant prison officials unbounded discretion to segregate inmates throughout prisons.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13.  But we have never treated <em>Turner</em> as a blank check to prison officials.  Quite to the contrary, this Court has long had \xe2\x80\x9cconfidence that . . . a reasonableness standard is not toothless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Abbott</em>, 490 U. S., at 414 (internal quotation marks omitted).  California prison officials segregate only double cells, because only those cells are particularly difficult to monitor\xe2\x80\x94unlike \xe2\x80\x9cdining halls, yards, and general housing areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Were California\xe2\x80\x99s policy not so narrow, the State might well have race-neutral means at its disposal capable of accommodating prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 rights without sacrificing their safety.  See <em>Turner</em>, 482 U. S., at 90\xe2\x80\x9391.  The majority does not say why <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard ably polices all other constitutional infirmities, just not racial discrimination.  In any event, it is not the refusal to apply\xe2\x80\x94for the first time ever\xe2\x80\x94a strict standard of review in the prison context that is \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally at odds\xe2\x80\x9d with our constitutional jurisprudence.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa01.  Instead, it is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s refusal\xe2\x80\x94for the first time ever\xe2\x80\x94to defer to the expert judgment of prison officials.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even under strict scrutiny analysis, \xe2\x80\x9cit is possible, even likely, that prison officials could show that the current policy meets the test.\xe2\x80\x9d  336 F.\xc2\xa03d 1117, 1121 (CA9 2003) (Ferguson, J., joined by Pregerson, Nelson, and Reinhardt, JJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  As Johnson concedes, all States have a compelling interest in maintaining order and internal security within their prisons.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 18; see also <em>Procunier</em>, 416 U. S.,<em> </em>at 404.  Thus the question on remand will be whether the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is narrowly tailored to serve California\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The other dissent notes the absence of evidence on that question, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Stevens, J.), but that is hardly California\xe2\x80\x99s fault.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the outset, Johnson himself has alleged, in terms taken from <em>Turner</em>, that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy is \xe2\x80\x9cnot related to a legitimate penological interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>California</em>, 207 F.\xc2\xa03d 650, 655 (CA9 2000) (discussing Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Third Amended Complaint).  In reinstating Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection claim following the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, the Court of Appeals repeated Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s allegation, without indicating that strict scrutiny should apply on remand before the District Court.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  And on remand, again Johnson alleged only that the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy \xe2\x80\x9cis not reasonably related to the legitimate penological interests of the CDC.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 51a (Fourth Amended Complaint \xc2\xb623).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the District Court granted qualified immunity to some of the defendants, Johnson once again appealed.  In his brief before the Court of Appeals, Johnson assumed that both <em>Lee</em> and <em>Turner</em> applied, without arguing that there was any tension between them; indeed, nowhere in his brief did Johnson even mention the words \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant in No. 01\xe2\x80\x9356436 (CA9), pp. 20, 26; 2001 WL 34091249.  Perhaps as a result, the Court of Appeals did not discuss strict scrutiny in its second decision, the one currently before this Court.  The Court of Appeals did find tension between <em>Lee</em> and <em>Turner;</em> however, it resolved this tension in <em>Turner</em>\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 799.  Yet the Court of Appeals accepted <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test at face value: Prison officials may only make racial classifications \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in good faith and in particularized circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797.  The Court of Appeals, like Johnson, did <em>not</em> equate <em>Lee</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test with strict scrutiny, and in fact it mentioned strict scrutiny only when it quoted the portion of <em>Turner</em> that <em>rejects</em> strict scrutiny as the proper standard of review in the prison context.  321 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 798.  Even Johnson did not make the leap equating <em>Lee</em> with strict scrutiny when he requested that the Court of Appeals rehear his case.

In such circumstances, California should be allowed to present evidence of narrow tailoring, evidence it was never obligated to present in either appearance before the District Court.

Of the 17 years Johnson has been incarcerated, California has assigned him a cellmate of the same race for no more than a year (and probably more like four months); Johnson has had black cellmates during the other 16 years, but by his own choice.  Nothing in the record demonstrates that if Johnson (or any other prisoner) requested to be housed with a person of a different race, it would be denied (though Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s gang affiliation with the Crips might stand in his way).  Moreover, Johnson concedes that California\xe2\x80\x99s prisons are racially violent places, and that he lives in fear of being attacked because of his race.  Perhaps on remand the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s policy will survive strict scrutiny, but in the event that it does not, Johnson may well have won a Pyrrhic victory.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Johnson has never requested\xe2\x80\x94not during his initial admittance,\nnor his subsequent transfers, nor his present incarceration\xe2\x80\x94that he be housed with a person of a different race.  App. 106a, 112a\xe2\x80\x93113a, 175a.

Thus the study says nothing about the violence likely to result from integrating cells when inmates are thrown together for brief periods during admittance or transfer.  What the study does say is that, once Texas has had the time to gather inmate-related information and make more permanent housing assignments, racially integrated cells may be the preferred option.  But California leaves open that door: Inmates are generally free to room with whomever they like on a permanent basis.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP\xe2\x80\x93030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cUpon arrival at the assessment and reception center \xe2\x80\xa6 [f]or reasons of safety and security, newly received inmates are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells\xe2\x80\x9d) (available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM\xe2\x80\x9301.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cUpon arrival at a reception and diagnostic center \xe2\x80\xa6 [f]or reasons of safety and security, newly-received offenders are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells due to the fact that the specific information needed to assess an offender\xe2\x80\x99s criminal and victimization history is not available until after diagnostic processing has been completed\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0On the majority\xe2\x80\x99s account, deference to the judgments of prison officials in the application of strict scrutiny is presumably warranted to account for \xe2\x80\x9cthe special circumstances [that prisons] present,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.
