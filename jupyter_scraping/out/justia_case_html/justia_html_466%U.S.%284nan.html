[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such awards have preclusive effect.  We granted certiorari, 464 U.S. 813 (1983), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On November 26, 1976, petitioner Gary McDonald, then a West Branch, Mich., police officer, was discharged.  McDonald </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 466 U. S. 286</a></p><p> filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in force between West Branch and the United Steelworkers of America (the Union), contending that there was "no proper cause" for his discharge and that, as a result, the discharge violated the collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  After the preliminary steps in the contractual grievance procedure had been exhausted, the grievance was taken to arbitration.  The arbitrator ruled against McDonald, however, finding that there was just cause for his discharge.</p>\n<p>McDonald did not appeal the arbitrator\'s decision.  Subsequently, however, he filed this \xc2\xa7 1983 action against the city of West Branch and certain of its officials, including its Chief of Police, Paul Longstreet. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In his complaint, McDonald alleged that he was discharged for exercising his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict against Longstreet, but in favor of the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment against Longstreet.  709 F.2d 1505 (1983).  The court reasoned that the parties had agreed to settle their disputes through the arbitration process and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 466 U. S. 287</a></p><p> that the arbitrator had considered the reasons for McDonald\'s discharge.  Finding that the arbitration process had not been abused, the Court of Appeals concluded that McDonald\'s First Amendment claims were barred by <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>At the outset, we must consider whether federal courts are obligated by statute to accord <em>res judicata</em> or collateral estoppel effect to the arbitrator\'s decision.  Respondents contend that the Federal Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738, requires that we give preclusive effect to the arbitration award.</p>\n<p>Our cases establish that \xc2\xa7 1738 obliges federal courts to give the same preclusive effect to a state court judgment as would the courts of the State rendering the judgment.  <em>See, e.g., Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/75/case.html">465 U. S. 75</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/75/case.html#81">465 U. S. 81</a></span> (1984); <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/case.html">456 U. S. 461</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/case.html#466">456 U. S. 466</a></span> (1982).  As we explained in <em>Kremer,</em> however, "[a]rbitration decisions . . . are not subject to the mandate of \xc2\xa7 1738."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/case.html#477">456 U. S. 477</a></span>.  This conclusion follows from the plain language of \xc2\xa7 1738, which provides in pertinent part that the</p>\n<p>"<em>judicial proceedings</em> [of any court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="288">Page 466 U. S. 288</a></p><p> of any State] shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Arbitration is not a "judicial proceeding." and therefore \xc2\xa7 1738 does not apply to arbitration awards. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Because federal courts are not required by statute to give <em>res judicata</em> or collateral estoppel effect to an unappealed arbitration award, any rule of preclusion would necessarily be judicially fashioned.  We therefore consider the question whether it was appropriate for the Court of Appeals to fashion such a rule.</p>\n<p>On two previous occasions, this Court has considered the contention that an award in an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement should preclude a subsequent suit in federal court.  In both instances, we rejected the claim.</p>\n<p><em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html">415 U. S. 36</a></span> (1974), was an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="289">Page 466 U. S. 289</a></p><p> brought by an employee who had unsuccessfully claimed in an arbitration proceeding that his discharge was racially motivated.  Although Alexander protested the same discharge in the Title VII action, we held that his Title VII claim was not foreclosed by the arbitral decision against him. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In addition, we declined to adopt a rule that would have required federal courts to defer to an arbitrator\'s decision on a discrimination claim when</p>\n<p>"(i) the claim was before the arbitrator; (ii) the collective bargaining agreement prohibited the form of discrimination charged in the suit under Title VII; and (iii) the arbitrator has authority to rule on the claim and to fashion a remedy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#55">415 U. S. 55</a></span>-56.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html">450 U. S. 728</a></span> (1981), Barrentine and a fellow employee had unsuccessfully submitted wage claims to arbitration.  Nevertheless, we rejected the contention that the arbitration award precluded a subsequent suit based on the same underlying facts alleging a violation of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#745">450 U. S. 745</a></span>-746.</p>\n<p>Our rejection of a rule of preclusion in <em>Barrentine</em> and our rejection of a rule of deferral in <em>Gardner-Denver</em> were based in large part on our conclusion that Congress intended the statutes at issue in those cases to be judicially enforceable, and that arbitration could not provide an adequate substitute for judicial proceedings in adjudicating claims under those statutes.  450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#740">450 U. S. 740</a></span>-746; 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#56">415 U. S. 56</a></span>-60.  These considerations similarly require that we find the doctrines of <em>res judicata</em> and collateral estoppel inapplicable in this \xc2\xa7 1983 action. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 466 U. S. 290</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because \xc2\xa7 1983 creates a cause of action, there is, of course, no question that Congress intended it to be judicially enforceable.  Indeed, as we explained in <em>Mitchum v. Foster,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html">407 U. S. 225</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/225/case.html#242">407 U. S. 242</a></span> (1972),</p>\n<p>"[t]he very purpose of \xc2\xa7 1983 was to interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people\'s federal rights -- to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law."</p>\n<p><em>See also Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/case.html">457 U. S. 496</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/case.html#503">457 U. S. 503</a></span> (1982).  And although arbitration is well suited to resolving contractual disputes, our decisions in <em>Barrentine</em> and <em>Gardner-Denver</em> compel the conclusion that it cannot provide an adequate substitute for a judicial proceeding in protecting the federal statutory and constitutional rights that \xc2\xa7 1983 is designed to safeguard.  As a result, according preclusive effect to an arbitration award in a subsequent \xc2\xa7 1983 action would undermine that statute\'s efficacy in protecting federal rights.  We need only briefly reiterate the considerations that support this conclusion.</p>\n<p>First, an arbitrator\'s expertise "pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land."  <em>Gardner-Denver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#57">415 U. S. 57</a></span>.  An arbitrator may not, therefore, have the expertise required to resolve the complex legal questions that arise in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, because an arbitrator\'s authority derives solely from the contract, <em>Barrentine, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#744">450 U. S. 744</a></span>, an arbitrator may not have the authority to enforce \xc2\xa7 1983.  As we explained in <em>Gardner-Denver:</em></p>\n<p>"The arbitrator . . . has no general authority to invoke public laws that conflict with the bargain between the parties. . . .  If an arbitral decision is based \'solely upon the arbitrator\'s view of the requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 466 U. S. 291</a></p><p> of enacted legislation,\' rather than on an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator has \'exceeded the scope of the submission,\' and the award will not be enforced."</p>\n<p>415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#53">415 U. S. 53</a></span>, quoting <em>Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/593/case.html">363 U. S. 593</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/593/case.html#597">363 U. S. 597</a></span> (1960).  Indeed, when the rights guaranteed by \xc2\xa7 1983 conflict with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator must enforce the agreement.  <em>Gardner-Denver,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#43">415 U. S. 43</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Third, when, as is usually the case, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the union has exclusive control over the "manner and extent to which an individual grievance is presented," <em>Gardner-Denver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#58">415 U. S. 58</a></span>, n.19, there is an additional reason why arbitration is an inadequate substitute for judicial proceedings.  The union\'s interests and those of the individual employee are not always identical or even compatible.  As a result, the union may present the employee\'s grievance less vigorously, or make different strategic choices, than would the employee.  <em>See Gardner-Denver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#58">415 U. S. 58</a></span>, n.19; <em>Barrentine, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#742">450 U. S. 742</a></span>.  Thus, were an arbitration award accorded preclusive effect, an employee\'s opportunity to be compensated for a constitutional deprivation might be lost merely because it was not in the union\'s interest to press his claim vigorously.</p>\n<p>Finally, arbitral factfinding is generally not equivalent to judicial factfinding.  As we explained in <em>Gardner-Denver,</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he record of the arbitration proceedings is not as complete; the usual rules of evidence do not apply; and rights and procedures common to civil trials, such as discovery, compulsory process, cross-examination, and testimony under oath, are often severely limited or unavailable."</p>\n<p>415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#57">415 U. S. 57</a></span>-58. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 466 U. S. 292</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is apparent, therefore, that in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action, an arbitration proceeding cannot provide an adequate substitute for a judicial trial. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Consequently, according preclusive effect to arbitration awards in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions would severely undermine the protection of federal rights that the statute is designed to provide. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We therefore hold that, in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action, a federal court should not afford <em>res judicata</em> or collateral estoppel effect to an award in an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 466 U. S. 293</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privilege, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 3.0 of Article III of the collective bargaining agreement between the city of West Branch and the Union provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"Among the powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities which shall continue to be vested in the City of West Branch, but not intended as a wholly inclusive list of them, shall be:  The right to . . . suspend or discharge employees for proper cause."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to Longstreet, the complaint named the following city officials as defendants:  Acting City Manager Bernard Olson, City Attorney Charles Jennings, and City Attorney Demetre Ellias.  McDonald also named the Union as a defendant, claiming that it had breached its state law duty to represent him fairly.  The District Court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, McDonald alleged that his discharge deprived him of property without due process of law.  The jury, however, rejected this claim.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Earlier this Term, we noted that various phrases have been used to describe the preclusive effects of former judgments.  <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/75/case.html">465 U. S. 75</a></span> (1984).  Because the Court of Appeals used the terms "<em>res judicata</em>" and "collateral estoppel," we find it convenient to use these terms in this opinion.  Thus, in this case, we utilize the term "<em>res judicata</em>" to refer to the effect of a judgment on the merits in barring a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies that is based on the same claim.  <em>See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/322/case.html">439 U. S. 322</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/322/case.html#326">439 U.

In both <em>Gardner-Denver</em> and <em>Barrentine,</em> however, we rejected similar contentions.  <em>See Gardner-Denver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#51">415 U.

For example, in <em>Gardner-Denver,</em> we considered the argument that the arbitration provision of the collective bargaining agreement waived the employee\'s right to bring a Title VII action.  We found this contention unpersuasive, however, concluding that</p>\n<p>"[t]he rights conferred [by Title VII] can form no part of the collective bargaining process, since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind Title VII."</p>\n<p><em>Gardner-Denver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#51">415 U.

Similarly, because preclusion of a judicial action would gravely undermine the effectiveness of \xc2\xa7 1983, we must reject the Court of Appeals\' reliance on and deference to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Consistent with our decisions in <em>Barrentine</em> and <em>Gardner-Denver,</em> an arbitral decision may be admitted as evidence in a \xc2\xa7 1983 action.  As in those cases:</p>\n<p>"We adopt no standards as to the weight to be accorded an arbitral decision, since this must be determined in the court\'s discretion with regard to the facts and circumstances of each case.  Relevant factors include the existence of provisions in the collective bargaining agreement that conform substantially with [the statute or constitution], the degree of procedural fairness in the arbitral forum, adequacy of the record with respect to the issue [in the judicial proceeding], and the special competence of particular arbitrators.  Where an arbitral determination gives full consideration to an employee\'s [statutory or constitutional] rights, a court may properly accord it great weight.  This is especially true where the issue is solely one of fact, specifically addressed by the parties and decided by the arbitrator on the basis of an adequate record.  But courts should ever be mindful that Congress . . . thought it necessary to provide a judicial forum for the ultimate resolution of [these] claims.  It is the duty of courts to assure the full availability of this forum."</p>\n<p><em>Gardner-Denver,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/case.html#60">415 U.
