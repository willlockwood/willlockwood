The two attorney respondents joined three indigent criminal defendants in filing suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the practice denies indigents their federal due process and equal protection rights.  The District Court held the practice and statute unconstitutional, but a Sixth Circuit panel reversed, holding that <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a>, abstention barred the indigents\xe2\x80\x99 suit, but that the attorneys had third-party standing to assert the indigents\xe2\x80\x99 rights; and that the statute was constitutional.  On rehearing, the en banc Sixth Circuit agreed on standing but found the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The attorneys lack third-party standing to assert the rights of Michigan indigent defendants denied appellate counsel.  The Court assumes that the attorneys have satisfied Article III\xe2\x80\x99s standing requirement and thus addresses only whether they have standing to raise the rights of others.  In deciding whether to grant third-party standing, this Court asks whether the party asserting the right has a \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d relationship with the person who possesses the right, and whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d to the possessor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect his own interests.  <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/400/index.html">499 U. S. 400</a>, 411.  The attorneys here claim standing based on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants who will request, but be denied, appellate counsel under the statute.  In two cases in which this Court found an attorney-client relationship sufficient to confer third-party standing\xe2\x80\x94<em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/617/index.html">491 U.

S. 715</a>\xe2\x80\x94the attorneys invoked known clients\xe2\x80\x99 rights, not those of the <em>hypothetical</em> clients asserted here.  And <em>Department of Labor</em> v. <em>Triplett</em>\xe2\x80\x94in which an attorney disciplined by his state bar for accepting a fee prohibited by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 was held to have third-party standing to invoke claimants\xe2\x80\x99 due process rights to challenge the fee restriction that resulted in his punishment\xe2\x80\x94falls within the class of cases allowing \xe2\x80\x9cstanding to litigate the rights of third parties when enforc[ing] the challenged restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U. S. 490</a>, 510.  The attorneys here do not have a \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with their alleged \xe2\x80\x9cclients\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, they have no relationship at all.   Nor have they demonstrated any \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d to the indigents\xe2\x80\x99 advancing their own constitutional rights against the Michigan scheme.  An indigent may seek leave to challenge the denial of appellate counsel in state court and then may seek a writ of certiorari in this Court; and both state and federal collateral review exist beyond that.  The attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 hypothesis that, without counsel, such avenues are effectively foreclosed was disproved in the Michigan courts and this Court, where <em>pro se</em> indigents have pursued them.  On a more fundamental level, if an attorney is all that the indigents need to perfect their challenge in state court and beyond, one wonders why these attorneys did not attend state court and assist them.  The fair inference is that they did not want the state process to take its course, but wanted a federal court to short-circuit the State\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the constitutional question.  Here, the indigents were appropriately dismissed under <em>Younger</em> because they had ample opportunities to raise their constitutional challenge in their ongoing state proceedings.  An unwillingness to allow the <em>Younger</em> principle to be thus circumvented is an additional reason to deny the attorneys third-party standing.

The only challengers before us are two attorneys who seek to invoke the rights of hypothetical indigents to challenge the procedure.  We hold that the attorneys lack standing and therefore do not reach the question of the procedure\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994, Michigan amended its Constitution to provide that \xe2\x80\x9can appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court\xe2\x80\x9d and not as of right.  Mich. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa720.  Following this amendment, several Michigan state judges began to deny appointed appellate counsel to indigents who pleaded guilty, and the Michigan Legislature subsequently codified this practice.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a (West 2000).  Under the statute, which was scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2000, appointment of appellate counsel for indigents who plead guilty is prohibited, with certain mandatory and permissive exceptions.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A challenge to the Michigan practice was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The named plaintiffs included the two attorney respondents and three indigents who were denied appellate counsel after pleading guilty.  Pursuant to Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, they alleged that the Michigan practice and statute denied indigents their federal constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice and the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A day before the statute was to take effect, the District Court issued an order holding the practice and statute unconstitutional.  <em>Tesmer</em> v. <em>Granholm</em>, 114 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 603 (2000).  It ultimately issued an injunction that bound all Michigan state judges, requiring them not to deny appellate counsel to any indigent who pleaded guilty.  114 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 622 (2000).  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  <em>Tesmer</em> v. <em>Granholm,</em> 295 F.\xc2\xa03d 536 (2002).  The panel held that <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971), abstention barred the suit by the indigents but that the attorneys had third-party standing to assert the rights of indigents.  It then held that the statute was constitutional.  The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc and reversed.  <em>Tesmer</em> v. <em>Granholm</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d 683 (2003).  The en banc majority agreed with the panel on standing but found that the statute was unconstitutional.  Separate dissents were filed, challenging the application of third-party standing and the holding that the statute was unconstitutional.  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1148/index.html">540 U. S. 1148</a> (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The doctrine of standing asks whether a litigant is entitled to have a federal court resolve his grievance.  This inquiry involves \xe2\x80\x9cboth constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U. S. 490</a>, 498 (1975).  In this case, we do not focus on the constitutional minimum of standing, which flows from Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html"></a><a href="/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560 (1992).  Instead, we shall assume the attorneys have satisfied Article III and address the alternative threshold question whether they have standing to raise the rights of others.  See <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html"></a><a href="/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 585 (1999).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have adhered to the rule that a party \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 499.  This rule assumes that the party with the right has the appropriate incentive to challenge (or not challenge) governmental action and to do so with the necessary zeal and appropriate presentation.  See 422 U. S., at 500.  It represents a \xe2\x80\x9chealthy concern that if the claim is brought by someone other than one at whom the constitutional protection is aimed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Secretary of State of Md.</em> v. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/947/index.html">467 U. S. 947</a>, 955, n.\xc2\xa05 (1984), the courts might be \xe2\x80\x9ccalled upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 500.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have not treated this rule as absolute, however, recognizing that there may be circumstances where it is necessary to grant a third party standing to assert the rights of another.  But we have limited this exception by requiring that a party seeking third-party standing make two additional showings.  First, we have asked whether the party asserting the right has a \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d relationship with the person who possesses the right.  <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/400/index.html">499 U. S. 400</a>, 411 (1991).  Second, we have considered whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d to the possessor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect his own interests.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have been quite forgiving with these criteria in certain circumstances.  \xe2\x80\x9cWithin the context of the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court has enunciated other concerns that justify a lessening of prudential limitations on standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Secretary of State of Md.</em> v. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 956.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n several cases, this Court has allowed standing to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged restriction <em>against the litigant </em>would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 510 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/index.html">410 U. S. 179</a> (1973); <em>Griswold</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/index.html">381 U. S. 479</a> (1965); <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a> (1953)); see <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/index.html">429 U. S. 190</a> (1976).  Beyond these examples\xe2\x80\x94none of which is implicated here\xe2\x80\x94we have not looked favorably upon third-party standing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Conn</em> v. <em>Gabbert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/286/index.html">526 U. S. 286</a>, 292\xe2\x80\x93293 (1999) (rejecting an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to adjudicate the rights of a client).  With this in mind, we turn to apply our \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d criteria to the facts before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorneys in this case invoke the attorney-client relationship to demonstrate the requisite closeness.  Specifically, they rely on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants \xe2\x80\x9cwho will request, but be denied, the appointment of appellate counsel, based on the operation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute.  App. 17a, \xc2\xb637 (Complaint).  In two cases, we have recognized an attorney-client relationship as sufficient to confer third-party standing.  See <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/617/index.html"></a><a href="/us/491/617/index.html">491 U. S. 617</a> (1989); <em>Department of Labor</em> v. <em>Triplett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/715/index.html">494 U. S. 715</a> (1990).  In <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <em>supra</em>, we granted a law firm third-party standing to challenge a drug forfeiture statute by invoking the rights of an existing client.  <em>Id.</em>, at 624, n.\xc2\xa03.  This <em>existing</em> attorney-client relationship is, of course, quite distinct from the <em>hypothetical</em> attorney-client relationship posited here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Department of Labor</em> v. <em>Triplett, supra</em>, we dealt with the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, which prohibited attorneys from accepting fees for representing claimants, unless such fees were approved by the appropriate agency or court.  30  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7932(a) (1982 ed., Supp. V).  An attorney, George Triplett, violated the Act and its implementing regulations by agreeing to represent claimants for 25% of any award obtained and then collecting those fees without the required approval.  The state bar disciplined Triplett, and we allowed Triplett third-party standing to invoke the due process rights of the claimants to challenge the fee restriction that resulted in his punishment.  494 U. S., at 720\xe2\x80\x93721.  <em>Triplett</em> is different from this case on two levels.  First, <em>Triplett</em> falls within that class of cases where we have \xe2\x80\x9callowed standing to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged restriction <em>against the litigant </em>would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 510 (emphasis added).  Second, and similar to <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale</em>, <em>Triplett</em> involved the representation of known claimants.  The attorneys before us do not have a \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with their alleged \xe2\x80\x9cclients\xe2\x80\x9d; indeed, they have no relationship at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider whether the attorneys have demonstrated that there is a \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d to the indigents\xe2\x80\x99 advancing their own constitutional rights against the Michigan scheme.  <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 411.  It is uncontested that an indigent denied appellate counsel has open avenues to argue that denial deprives him of his constitutional rights.  He may seek leave to challenge that denial in the Michigan Court of Appeals and, if denied, seek leave in the Michigan Supreme Court.  See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3 (West Supp. 2004).  He then may seek a writ of certiorari in this Court.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257(a).  Beyond that, there exists both state and federal collateral review.  See Mich. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.500 (2004); 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorneys argue that, without counsel, these avenues are effectively foreclosed to indigents.  They claim that unsophisticated, <em>pro se</em> criminal defendants could not satisfy the necessary procedural requirements, and, if they did, they would be unable to coherently advance the substance of their constitutional claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That hypothesis, however, was disproved in the Michigan courts, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson</em>, 463 Mich. 949, 620 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 528 (2001) (<em>pro se</em> defendant sought leave to appeal denial of appointment of appellate counsel to the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court); <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins</em>, 463 Mich. 949, 620 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 528 (2001) (same), and this Court, see Pet. for Cert. in <em>Halbert </em>v. <em>Michigan</em>, O. T. 2004, No. 03\xe2\x80\x9310198 (pending request for writ of certiorari by a <em>pro se</em> defendant challenging the denial of appellate counsel).  While we agree that an attorney would be valuable to a criminal defendant challenging the constitutionality of the scheme, we do not think that the lack of an attorney here is the type of hindrance necessary to allow another to assert the indigent defendants\xe2\x80\x99 rights.  See <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 411.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also are unpersuaded by the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d argument on a more fundamental level.  If an attorney is all that the indigents need to perfect their challenge in state court and beyond, one wonders why the attorneys asserting this \xc2\xa71983 action did not attend state court and assist them.  We inquired into this question at oral argument but did not receive a satisfactory answer.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, 35\xe2\x80\x9340.  It is a fair inference that the attorneys and the three indigent plaintiffs that filed this \xc2\xa71983 action did not want to allow the state process to take its course.  Rather, they wanted a federal court to short-circuit the State\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of this constitutional question.  That is precisely what they got.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal and state courts are complementary systems for administering justice in our Nation.  Cooperation and comity, not competition and conflict, are essential to the federal design.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruhrgas AG </em>v. <em>Marathon Oil Co.</em>, 526 U. S., at 586.  The doctrine of <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/37/index.html">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971), reinforces our federal scheme by preventing a state criminal defendant from asserting ancillary challenges to ongoing state criminal procedures in federal court.  <em>Id.</em>, at 54\xe2\x80\x9355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the three indigent criminal defendants who were originally plaintiffs in this \xc2\xa71983 action were appropriately dismissed under <em>Younger</em>.  As the Court of Appeals unanimously recognized, they had ongoing state criminal proceedings and ample avenues to raise their constitutional challenge in those proceedings.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  333 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 690\xe2\x80\x93691.  There also was no extraordinary circumstance requiring federal intervention.  <em>Ibid</em>.  An unwillingness to allow the <em>Younger</em> principle to be thus circumvented is an additional reason to deny the attorneys third-party standing.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we hold that the attorneys do not have third-party standing to assert the rights of Michigan indigent defendants denied appellate counsel.

Fitzgerald and Michael D. Vogler are Michigan attorneys who have routinely received appointments to represent defendants in state-court criminal appeals, including appeals from plea-based convictions.  They assert third-party standing to challenge a state law limiting an indigent\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel: As codified in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a(1) (West 2000), the challenged law prescribes that most indigents</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwho plea[d] guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction or sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe attorneys before us emphasize that indigent defendants generally are unable to navigate the appellate process <em>pro se</em>.  In view of that reality, the attorneys brought this action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, to advance indigent defendants\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional right to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s aid in pursuing appeals from plea-based convictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily,\xe2\x80\x9d attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler acknowledge, \xe2\x80\x9cone may not claim standing \xe2\x80\xa6 to vindicate the constitutional rights of [a] third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a>, 255 (1953).  The Court has recognized exceptions to the general rule, however, when certain circumstances combine: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cThe litigant [has] suffered an \xe2\x80\x98injury in fact,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 giving him or her a \xe2\x80\x98sufficiently concrete interest\xe2\x80\x99 in the outcome of the issue in dispute\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe litigant [has] a close relation to the third party\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthere [exists] some hindrance to the third party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect his or her own interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Powers</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/400/index.html">499 U. S. 400</a>, 411 (1991) (quoting <em>Singleton</em> v. <em>Wulff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/106/index.html">428 U. S. 106</a>, 112 (1976)).  The first requirement is of a different order than the second and third, for whether a litigant meets the constitutional prescription of injury in fact determines whether his suit is \xe2\x80\x9ca case or controversy subject to a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s Art.\xc2\xa0III jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  By contrast, the close relation and hindrance criteria are \xe2\x80\x9cprudential considerations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Secretary of State of Md.</em> v. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/947/index.html">467 U.

I conclude, as well, that those attorneys have demonstrated a formidable hindrance to the indigents\xe2\x80\x99 ability to proceed without the aid of counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to injury in fact, attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler alleged in their complaint that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7770.3a would cause them direct economic loss because it will \xe2\x80\x9creduc[e] the number of cases in which they could be appointed and paid as assigned appellate counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 16a.  This allegation is hardly debatable.  The Michigan system for assigning appellate attorneys to indigent defendants operates on a strict rotation.  With fewer cases to be assigned under the new statute, the pace of the rotation would slow, and Fitzgerald and Vogler, who are on the rosters for assignment, would earn less for representation of indigent appellants than they earned in years prior to the cutback on state-funded appeals.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Singleton</em> v. <em>Wulff</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/106/index.html">428 U.

Inescapably, the same reasoning applies to attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler.  They have alleged their past, state-paid representation of indigent defendants in appeals from plea-based convictions, and their aim to continue such representation in the future.  As in <em>Singleton</em>, they will suffer injury \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U.

See <em>Munson</em>, 467 U. S., at 973 (Stevens, J., concurring) (propriety of third-party standing depends on \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of the relationship\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Singleton</em>,<em> </em>for example, acknowledged the significant bond between physician and patient.  See 428 U. S., at 117 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he physician is uniquely qualified to litigate the constitutionality of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interference with, or discrimination against, [the abortion] decision.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Similarly, this Court has twice recognized, in the third-party standing context, that the attorney-client relationship is of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/617/index.html">491 U.

See <em>Carey</em>, 431 U. S., at 683; <em>Craig</em> v. <em>Boren,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/index.html"></a><a href="/us/429/190/index.html">429 U. S. 190</a>, 195 (1976). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, as I see it, this case turns on the last of the three third-party standing inquiries, here, the existence of an impediment to the indigent defendants\xe2\x80\x99 effective assertion of their own rights through litigation.  I note first that the Court has approached this requirement with a degree of elasticity.  See <em>id.,</em> at 216 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (males between the ages of 18 and 21 who sought to purchase 3.2% beer faced no serious obstacle to asserting their own rights).  The hindrance faced by a rightholder need only be \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cinsurmountable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Singleton</em>, 428 U. S., at 116\xe2\x80\x93117 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Munson</em>, 467 U. S., at 956 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere practical obstacles prevent a party from asserting rights on behalf of itself \xe2\x80\xa6 the Court has recognized [third-party standing].\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even assuming a requirement with more starch than the Court has insisted upon in prior decisions, this case satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cimpediment\xe2\x80\x9d test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine whether the indigent defendants are impeded from asserting their own rights, one must recognize the incapacities under which these defendants labor and the complexity of the issues their cases may entail.  According to the Department of Justice, approximately eight out of ten state felony defendants use court-appointed lawyers.  U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, C. Harlow, Defense Counsel in\nCriminal Cases<em> </em>1, 5 (Nov. 2000), available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/dccc.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Dec. 8, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Approximately 70% of indigent defendants represented by appointed counsel plead guilty, and 70% of those convicted are incarcerated.  <em>Id.,</em> at 6, (Tables 10\xe2\x80\x9311).  It is likely that many of these indigent defendants, in common with 68% of the state prison population, did not complete high school, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, C. Harlow, Education and Correctional Populations 1 (Jan. 2003), available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/ecp.pdf, and many lack the most basic literacy skills, U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Literacy Behind Prison Walls xviii, 10, 17 (Oct. 1994) (NCES 1994\xe2\x80\x93102), available at http://nces.ed.gov/pubs94/94102.pdf.  A Department of Education study found that about seven out of ten inmates fall in the lowest two out of five levels of literacy\xe2\x80\x94marked by an inability to do such basic tasks as write a brief letter to explain an error on a credit card bill, use a bus schedule, or state in writing an argument made in a lengthy newspaper article.  <em>Id.,</em> at 10, app. A (Interpreting the Literacy Scales).  An inmate so handicapped surely does not possess the skill necessary to pursue a competent <em>pro se</em> appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These indigent and poorly educated defendants face appeals from guilty pleas often no less complex than other appeals.

Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s stated Rule requires a defendant to file an application for appeal within 21 days after entry of the judgment.  Mich. Rule App. Proc. 7.205(A) (2004).  The defendant must submit five copies of the application \xe2\x80\x9cstating the date and nature of the judgment or order appealed from; concisely reciting the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of error and the relief sought; [and] setting forth a concise argument \xe2\x80\xa6 in support of the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s position on each issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 7.205(B)(1).  The State Court Administrative Office has furnished a three-page form application accompanied by two pages of instructions for defendants seeking leave to appeal after sentencing on a guilty plea.  But this form is unlikely to provide adequate aid to an indigent and poorly educated defendant.  The form requires entry of such information as \xe2\x80\x9ccharge code(s), MCL citation/PACC Code,\xe2\x80\x9d asks the applicant to state the issues and facts relevant to the appeal, and then requires the applicant to \xe2\x80\x9cstate the law that supports your position and explain how the law applies to the facts of your case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Application for Leave to Appeal After Sentencing on Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere, http://courts.michigan.gov/scao/courtforms/appeals/\ncc405.pdf (rev.

This last task would not be onerous for an applicant familiar with law school examinations, but it is a tall order for a defendant of marginal literacy.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, agreeing with Judge Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 dissent from the en banc Sixth Circuit decision, writes that recognizing third-party standing here would allow lawyers generally to assert standing to champion their potential clients\xe2\x80\x99 rights.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa05.  For example, a medical malpractice attorney could challenge a tort reform statute on behalf of a future client or a Social Security lawyer could challenge new regulations.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>Tesmer </em>v. <em>Granholm</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d 683, 709\xe2\x80\x93710 (CA6 2003) (en banc).  In such cases, however, in marked contrast to the instant case, the persons directly affected\xe2\x80\x94malpractice plaintiffs or benefits claimants\xe2\x80\x94would face no unusual obstacle in securing the aid of counsel to attack the disadvantageous statutory or regulatory change.  There is no cause, therefore, to allow an attorney to challenge the benefit- or award-reducing provision in a suit brought in the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s name.  The party whose interests the provision directly impacts can instead mount the challenge with the aid of counsel. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is \xe2\x80\x9cunusual because it is the deprivation of counsel itself that prevents indigent defendants from protecting their right to counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17.  The challenged statute leaves indigent criminal defendants without the aid needed to gain access to the appellate forum and thus without a viable means to protect their rights.  Cf. <em>Evitts</em> v. <em>Lucey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/387/index.html">469 U. S. 387</a>, 393 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he services of a lawyer will for virtually every layman be necessary to present an appeal in a form suitable for appellate consideration on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is \xe2\x80\x9cunpersuaded by the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98hindrance\xe2\x80\x99 argument,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, in the main, because it sees a clear path for Fitzgerald and Vogler: They could have \xe2\x80\x9cattend[ed] state court and assist[ed] [indigent defendants.]\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Had the attorneys taken this course, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of criminal defendants would have gone uncounseled while the attorneys afforded assistance to a few individuals.  In order to protect the rights of <em>all </em>indigent defendants, the attorneys sought prospective classwide relief to prevent the statute from taking effect.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem was we had to file this litigation before the statute went into effect because once the statute went into effect, thousands of Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to their right to appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case implicates none of the concerns underlying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prudential criteria.  The general prohibition against third-party standing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy,\xe2\x80\x99 and it assures the court that the issues before it will be concrete and sharply presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Munson</em>, 467 U. S., at 955 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 22 (1960)).  Attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler have \xe2\x80\x9cproperly \xe2\x80\xa6 frame[d] the issues and present[ed] them with the necessary adversarial zeal,\xe2\x80\x9d 467 U.

Whether a federal court should abstain under <em>Younger</em> is, of course, distinct from whether a party has standing to sue.  See 401 U. S., at 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (dismissing three appellees on standing grounds before addressing the abstention question).  <em>Younger</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[has] little force in the absence of a pending state proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Steffel</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html">415 U.

Attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler filed this suit before the Michigan statute took effect.  At that time, <em>no</em> state criminal proceeding governed by the statute existed with which this suit could interfere.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, this case presents an unusual if not unique case of defendants facing near-insurmountable practical obstacles to protecting their rights in the state forum: First, it is the deprivation of counsel itself that prevents indigent defendants, many of whom are likely to be unsophisticated and poorly educated, from protecting their rights; second, the substantive issues that such defendants could raise in an appeal are myriad and often complicated; and third, the procedural requirements for an appeal after a guilty plea are not altogether indigent-user friendly.  The exposure of impecunious defendants to these access-to-appeal blockages in state court makes the need for this suit all the more compelling. </p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, I would affirm the en banc Sixth Circuit decision that attorneys Fitzgerald and Vogler have standing to maintain the instant action and would proceed to the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0True, in several cases in which third-party standing was upheld on the basis of economic injury, the law in question proscribed conduct in which the challenger sought to engage.

Our decisions confirm, however, that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to an enforcement action is not essential to an injury-in-fact determination.
