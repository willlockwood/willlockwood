First, the investigatory stop (temporary detention) must be lawful, a requirement met in an on-the-street encounter when a police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a crime.  Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk (patdown for weapons), the officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.  For the duration of a traffic stop, the Court recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone in the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d the driver and all passengers.  <em>Brendlin</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/249/index.html">551 U. S. 249</a>, 255.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While patrolling near a Tucson neighborhood associated with the Crips gang, police officers serving on Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s gang task force stopped an automobile for a vehicular infraction warranting a citation.  At the time of the stop, the officers had no reason to suspect the car\xe2\x80\x99s occupants of criminal activity.  Officer Trevizo attended to respondent Johnson, the back-seat passenger, whose behavior and clothing caused Trevizo to question him.  After learning that Johnson was from a town with a Crips gang and had been in prison, Trevizo asked him get out of the car in order to question him further, out of the hearing of the front-seat passenger, about his gang affiliation.  Because she suspected that he was armed, she patted him down for safety when he exited the car.  During the patdown, she felt the butt of a gun.  At that point, Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo handcuffed him.  Johnson was charged with<em>, inter alia</em>, possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that the stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.  Johnson was convicted.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.  While recognizing that Johnson was lawfully seized, the court found that, prior to the frisk, the detention had evolved into a consensual conversation about his gang affiliation.  Trevizo, the court therefore concluded, had no right to pat Johnson down even if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dangerous.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Officer Trevizo\xe2\x80\x99s patdown of Johnson did not violate the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.

In <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Mimms</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/106/index.html">434 U. S. 106</a> <em>(per curiam),</em> the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9conce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 111, n.\xc2\xa06, because the government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate and weighty\xe2\x80\x9d interest in officer safety outweighs the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>de minimis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle, <em>id.</em>, at 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  Citing <em>Terry,</em> the Court further held that a driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver might be armed and dangerous.  434 U. S., at 112.  <em>Wilson</em>, 519 U. S., at 413, held that the <em>Mimms</em> rule applies to passengers as well as drivers, based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe same weighty interest in officer safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brendlin</em>, 551 U. S., at 263, held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the road.\xe2\x80\x9d  A passenger\xe2\x80\x99s motivation to use violence during the stop to prevent apprehension for a crime more grave than a traffic violation is just as great as that of the driver.  519 U. S., at 414.  And as \xe2\x80\x9cthe passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 413\xe2\x80\x93414, \xe2\x80\x9cthe additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 415.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger, but concluded that once Officer Trevizo began questioning him on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.  The court portrayed the interrogation as consensual, and, Johnson emphasizes, Trevizo testified that Johnson could have refused to exit the vehicle and to submit to the patdown.  But Trevizo also testified that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her questions or otherwise cooperate with her.  A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop.  Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave.  An officer\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the stop\xe2\x80\x99s duration.  See <em>Muehler</em> v. <em>Mena</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/93/index.html">544 U. S. 93</a>, 100\xe2\x80\x93101.  A reasonable passenger would understand that during the time a car is lawfully stopped, he or she is not free to terminate the encounter with the police and move about at will.  Nothing occurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free \xe2\x80\x9cto depart without police permission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brendlin</em>, 551 U. S., at 257.  Trevizo was not required by the Fourth Amendment to give Johnson an opportunity to depart without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.

In a pathmarking decision, <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a> (1968), the Court considered whether an investigatory stop (temporary detention) and frisk (patdown for weapons) may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  The Court upheld \xe2\x80\x9cstop and frisk\xe2\x80\x9d as constitutionally permissible if two conditions are met.  First, the investigatory stop must be lawful.  That requirement is met in an on-the-street encounter, <em>Terry</em> determined, when the police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense.  Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the duration of a traffic stop, we recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone in the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d the driver and all passengers.  <em>Brendlin</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/249/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/249/index.html">551 U. S. 249</a>, 255 (2007).  Accordingly, we hold that, in a traffic-stop setting, the first <em>Terry</em> condition\xe2\x80\x94a lawful investigatory stop\xe2\x80\x94is met whenever it is lawful for police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into a vehicular violation.  The police need not have, in addition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity.  To justify a patdown of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 19, 2002, Officer Maria Trevizo and Detectives Machado and Gittings, all members of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s gang task force, were on patrol in Tucson near a neighborhood associated with the Crips gang.  At approximately 9 p.m., the officers pulled over an automobile after a license plate check revealed that the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s registration had been suspended for an insurance-related violation.  Under Arizona law, the violation for which the vehicle was stopped constituted a civil infraction warranting a citation.  At the time of the stop, the vehicle had three occupants\xe2\x80\x94the driver, a front-seat passenger, and a passenger in the back seat, Lemon Montrea Johnson, the respondent here.  In making the stop the officers had no reason to suspect anyone in the vehicle of criminal activity.  See App. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three officers left their patrol car and approached the stopped vehicle.  Machado instructed all of the occupants to keep their hands visible.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14.  He asked whether there were any weapons in the vehicle; all responded no.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  Machado then directed the driver to get out of the car.  Gittings dealt with the front-seat passenger, who stayed in the vehicle throughout the stop.  See <em>id.</em>, at 31.  While Machado was getting the driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and information about the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s registra-\ntion and insurance, see <em>id.</em>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343, Trevizo attended to\nJohnson.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Trevizo noticed that, as the police approached, Johnson looked back and kept his eyes on the officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 12.  When she drew near, she observed that Johnson was wearing clothing, including a blue bandana, that she considered consistent with Crips membership.  <em>Id.</em>, at 17.  She also noticed a scanner in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s jacket pocket, which \xe2\x80\x9cstruck [her] as highly unusual and cause [for] concern,\xe2\x80\x9d  because  \xe2\x80\x9cmost people\xe2\x80\x9d would not carry around a scanner that way \xe2\x80\x9cunless they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be involved in some kind of criminal activity or [are] going to try to evade the police by listening to the scanner.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at<em> </em>16.  In response to Trevizo\xe2\x80\x99s questions, Johnson provided his name and date of birth but said he had no identification with him.  He volunteered that he was from Eloy, Arizona, a place Trevizo knew was home to a Crips gang.  Johnson further told Trevizo that he had served time in prison for burglary and had been out for about a year.  217 Ariz. 58, 60, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d 667, 669 (App. 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Trevizo wanted to question Johnson away from the front-seat passenger to gain \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence about the gang [Johnson] might be in.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 19.  For that reason, she asked him to get out of the car.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Johnson complied.  Based on Trevizo\xe2\x80\x99s observations and Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s answers to her questions while he was still seated in the car, Trevizo suspected that \xe2\x80\x9che might have a weapon on him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 20.  When he exited the vehicle, she therefore \xe2\x80\x9cpatted him down for officer safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>During the patdown, Trevizo felt the butt of a gun near Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s waist.  217 Ariz., at 60, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 669.  At that point Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo placed him in handcuffs.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Johnson was charged in state court with<em>, inter alia</em>, possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor.  He moved to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an unlawful search.  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.  See App. 74\xe2\x80\x9378.  A jury convicted Johnson of the gun-possession charge.  See 217 Ariz., at 60\xe2\x80\x9361, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 669\xe2\x80\x93670.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 59, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 668.  Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson was [lawfully] seized when the officers stopped the car,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 62, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 671, the court nevertheless concluded that prior to the frisk the detention had \xe2\x80\x9cevolved into a separate, consensual encounter stemming from an unrelated investigation by Trevizo of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s possible gang affiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.</em>, at 64, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 673.  Absent \xe2\x80\x9creason to believe Johnson was involved in criminal activity,\xe2\x80\x9d the Arizona appeals court held, Trevizo \xe2\x80\x9chad no right to pat him down for weapons, even if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Espinosa dissented.  He found it \xe2\x80\x9chighly unrealistic to conclude that merely because [Trevizo] was courteous and Johnson cooperative, the ongoing and virtually simultaneous chain of events [had] somehow \xe2\x80\x98evolved into a consensual encounter\xe2\x80\x99 in the few short moments involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 66, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 675.  Throughout the episode, he stressed, Johnson remained \xe2\x80\x9cseized as part of [a] valid traffic stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Further, he maintained, Trevizo \xe2\x80\x9chad a reasonable basis to consider [Johnson] dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 67, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 676, and could therefore ensure her own safety and that of others at the scene by patting down Johnson for weapons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.

S. 1</a> (1968).  <em>Terry</em> involved a stop for interrogation of men whose conduct had attracted the attention of a patrolling police officer.  The officer\xe2\x80\x99s observation led him reasonably to suspect that the men were casing a jewelry shop in preparation for a robbery.  He conducted a patdown, which disclosed weapons concealed in the men\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat pockets.  This Court upheld the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 determinations that the interrogation was warranted and the patdown, permissible.  See <em>id.</em>, at 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Terry </em>established the legitimacy of an investigatory stop \xe2\x80\x9cin situations where [the police] may lack probable cause for an arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 24.  When the stop is justified by suspicion (reasonably grounded, but short of probable cause) that criminal activity is afoot, the Court explained, the police officer must be positioned to act instantly on reasonable suspicion that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Recognizing that a limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to protect both the officer and the public, the Court held the patdown reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 27, 30\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ost traffic stops,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has observed, \xe2\x80\x9cresemble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in <em>Terry</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Berkemer</em> v. <em>McCarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/index.html">468 U.

S., at 415. \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he same weighty interest in officer safety,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cis present regardless of whether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or passenger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 413.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, the Court acknowledged, that in a lawful traffic stop, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a minor vehicular offense,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no such reason to stop or detain the passengers.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em>  On the other hand, the Court emphasized, the risk of a violent encounter in a traffic-stop setting \xe2\x80\x9cstems not from the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a speeding violation, but from the fact that evidence of a more serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 414.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he motivation of a passenger to employ violence to prevent apprehension of such a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cis every bit as great as that of the driver.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em>  Moreover, the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cas a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 413\xe2\x80\x93414, so \xe2\x80\x9cthe additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 415.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Completing the picture, <em>Brendlin </em>held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the road.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 263.  A passenger therefore has standing to challenge a stop\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  <em>Id.</em>, at 256\xe2\x80\x93259.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After <em>Wilson</em>, but before <em>Brendlin</em>, the Court had stated, in dictum, that officers who conduct \xe2\x80\x9croutine traffic stop[s]\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cperform a \xe2\x80\x98patdown\xe2\x80\x99 of a driver and any passengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be armed and dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Iowa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/113/index.html">525 U. S. 113</a>, 117\xe2\x80\x93118 (1998).  That forecast, we now confirm, accurately captures the combined thrust of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Mimms</em>, <em>Wilson</em>, and <em>Brendlin</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger.  See 217 Ariz., at 64, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 673.  But, that court concluded, once Officer Trevizo undertook to question Johnson on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, <em>i.e.</em>, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s gang affiliation, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.  See <em>id.</em>, at 65, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 674.  In support of the Arizona court\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of Trevizo\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation of Johnson as \xe2\x80\x9cconsensual,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson emphasizes Trevizo\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at the suppression hearing.  Responding to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s questions, Trevizo affirmed her belief that Johnson could have \xe2\x80\x9crefused to get out of the car\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto turn around for the pat down.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 41.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not clear why the prosecutor, in opposing the suppression motion, sought to portray the episode as consensual.  Cf. <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Bostick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/429/index.html">501 U. S. 429</a> (1991) (holding that police officers\xe2\x80\x99 search of a bus passenger\xe2\x80\x99s luggage can be based on consent).  In any event, Trevizo also testified that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her questions or otherwise cooperate with her.  See App<em>.</em> 45.  And during cross-examination, Trevizo did not disagree when defense counsel asked \xe2\x80\x9cin fact you weren\xe2\x80\x99t seeking [Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s] permission \xe2\x80\xa6 ?\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  As the dissenting judge observed, \xe2\x80\x9cconsensual\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9cunrealistic\xe2\x80\x9d characterization of the Trevizo-Johnson interaction.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he encounter \xe2\x80\xa6 took place within minutes of the stop\xe2\x80\x9d; the patdown followed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin mere moments\xe2\x80\x9d of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the vehicle; beyond genuine debate, the point at which Johnson could have felt free to leave had not yet occurred.  See 217 Ariz., at 66, 170 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 675.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop.  Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave.  See <em>Brendlin</em>, 551 U. S., at 258.  An officer\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.  See <em>Muehler</em> v. <em>Mena</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/93/index.html">544 U. S. 93</a>, 100\xe2\x80\x93101 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, as stated in <em>Brendlin</em>, a traffic stop of a car communicates to a reasonable passenger that he or she is not free to terminate the encounter with the police and move about at will.  See 551 U. S., at 257.  Nothing occurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free \xe2\x80\x9cto depart without police permission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Officer Trevizo surely was not constitutionally required to give Johnson an opportunity to depart the scene after he exited the vehicle without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals majority did not assert that Johnson reasonably could have felt free to leave.

That position, however, appears at odds with our decision in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/519/408/index.html"></a><a href="/us/519/408/index.html">519 U.
