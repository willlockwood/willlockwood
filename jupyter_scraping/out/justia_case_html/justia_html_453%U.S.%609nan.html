Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax, a general revenue tax, is in proper proportion to appellants\' activities within the State, and, therefore, to their enjoyment of the opportunities and protection which the State has afforded in connection with those activities, such as police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained workforce, and the advantages of a civilized society.

Even assuming that the tax may reduce royalty payments to the Federal Government under leases executed in Montana, this fact alone does not demonstrate that the tax is inconsistent with the Act.  Indeed, in \xc2\xa7 32 of the Act, Congress expressly authorized the States to impose severance taxes on federal lessees without imposing any limits on the amount of such taxes.  And there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act or its amendments to support appellants\' assertion that Congress intended to maximize and capture through royalties <em>all</em> "economic rents" (the difference between the cost of production and the market price of the coal) from the mining of federal coal, and then to divide the proceeds with the State in accordance with the statutory formula.

In this appeal, we consider whether the tax Montana levies on each ton of coal mined in the State, Mont.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 15-35-101 <em>et seq.</em> (1979), violates the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Buried beneath Montana are large deposits of low-sulfur coal, most of it on federal land.  Since 1921, Montana has imposed a severance tax on the output of Montana coal mines, including coal mined on federal land.  After commissioning a study of coal production taxes in 1974, <em>see</em> House Resolutions Nos. 45 and 93, Senate Resolution No. 83, 1974 Mont. Laws 1619-1620, 1653-1654, 1683-1684 (Mar. 14 and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 453 U.

Mont.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 15-35-103 (1979).  The tax is levied at varying rates depending on the value, energy content. and method of extraction of the coal, and may equal, at a maximum, 30% of the "contract sales price." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Under the terms of a 1976 amendment to the Montana Constitution, after December 31, 1979, at least 50% of the revenues generated by the tax must be paid into a permanent trust fund, the principal of which may be appropriated only by a vote of three-fourths of the members of each house of the legislature.  Mont. Const., Art. IX, \xc2\xa7 5.</p>\n<p>Appellants, 4 Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, filed these suits in Montana state court in 1978.  They sought refunds of over $5.4 million in severance taxes paid under protest, a declaration that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses, and an injunction against further collection of the tax.  Without receiving any evidence, the court upheld the tax and dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  ___ Mont. ___, 615 P.2d 847 (1980).  The Supreme Court held that the tax is not subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] because it is imposed on the severance of coal, which the court characterized as an intrastate activity preceding entry of the coal into interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 453 U. S. 614</a></p><p> commerce.  In this regard, the Montana court relied on this Court\'s decisions in <em>Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/245/case.html">260 U. S. 245</a></span> (1922), <em>Oliver Iron Mining Co. v.

Hall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/284/case.html">274 U. S. 284</a></span> (1927), which employed similar reasoning in upholding state severance taxes against Commerce Clause challenges.  As an alternative basis for its resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, the Montana court held, as a matter of law, that the tax survives scrutiny under the four-part test articulated by this Court in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html">430 U. S. 274</a></span> (1977).  The Montana court also rejected appellants\' Supremacy Clause [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] challenge, concluding that appellants had failed to show that the Montana tax conflicts with any federal statute.</p>\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction, 449 U.S. 1033 (1980), to consider the important issues raised.  We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, appellants assert that the Montana Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Montana tax is not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause.  In appellants\' view, <em>Heisler\'s</em> "mechanical" approach, which looks to whether a state tax is levied on goods prior to their entry into interstate commerce, no longer accurately reflects the law.  Appellants contend that the correct analysis focuses on whether the challenged tax substantially affects interstate commerce, in which case it must be scrutinized under the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test.</p>\n<p>We agree that <em>Heisler\'s</em> reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases.  The <em>Heisler</em> analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 453 U.

Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States\' taxing power. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a "local" or intrastate activity.  <em>See Hunt v.

Consequently, the <em>Heisler</em> Court\'s concern that a loss of state taxing authority would be an inevitable result of subjecting taxes on "local" activities to Commerce Clause scrutiny is no longer tenable.\n</em></p>\n<p>We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in <em>Heisler</em> and its progeny are disapproved. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under <em>Complete Auto Transit\'s</em> four-part test.  Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it</p>\n<p>"is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State."</p>\n<p>430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html#279">430 U. S. 279</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants do not dispute that the Montana tax satisfies the first two prongs of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test.  As the Montana Supreme Court noted, "there can be no argument here that a substantial, in fact, the only, nexus of the severance of coal is established in Montana."  ___ Mont. at ___, 615 P.2d at 855.  Nor is there any question here regarding apportionment or potential multiple taxation, for as the state court observed, "the severance can occur in no other state" and "no other state can tax the severance."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Appellants do contend, however, that the Montana tax is invalid under the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test.</p>\n<p>Appellants assert that the Montana tax "discriminate[s] against interstate commerce" because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies, and thus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 453 U. S. 618</a></p><p> to citizens of other States.  But the Montana tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal, and there is no suggestion here that the tax is administered in a manner that departs from this evenhanded formula.  We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other "discrimination" cases.  <em>See, e.g., Maryland v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/case.html">451 U. S. 725</a></span> (1981); <em>Boston Stock Exchange v.

S. 617</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>Instead, the gravamen of appellants\' claim is that a state tax must be considered discriminatory for purposes of the Commerce Clause if the tax burden is borne primarily by out-of-state consumers.  Appellants do not suggest that this assertion is based on any of this Court\'s prior discriminatory tax cases.  In fact, a similar claim was considered and rejected in <em>Heisler.</em>  There, it was argued that Pennsylvania had a virtual monopoly of anthracite coal, and that, because 80% of the coal was shipped out of State, the tax discriminated against and impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.  260 U.S. at 251-253 [argument of counsel -- omitted].  The Court, however, dismissed these factors as "adventitious considerations."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/245/case.html#259">260 U. S. 259</a></span>.  We share the <em>Heisler</em> Court\'s misgivings about judging the validity of a state tax by assessing the State\'s "monopoly" position or its "exportation" of the tax burden out of State.</p>\n<p>The premise of our discrimination cases is that "[t]he very purpose of the Commerce Clause was to create an area of free trade among the several State."  <em>McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/327/case.html">322 U.

Under such a regime, the borders between the States are essentially irrelevant.  As the Court stated in <em>West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/229/case.html">221 U.

Consequently, to accept appellants\' theory and invalidate the Montana tax solely because most of Montana\'s coal is shipped across the very state borders that ordinarily are to be considered irrelevant would require a significant and, in our view, unwarranted departure from the rationale of our prior discrimination cases.\n</em></p>\n<p>Furthermore, appellants\' assertion that Montana may not "exploit" its "monopoly" position by exporting tax burdens to other States cannot rest on a claim that there is need to protect the out-of-state consumers of Montana coal from discriminatory tax treatment.  As previously noted, there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed, and not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.  Rather, appellants assume that the Commerce Clause gives residents of one State a right of access at "reasonable" prices to resources located in another State that is richly endowed with such resources, without regard to whether and on what terms residents of the resource-rich State have access to the resources.  We are not convinced that the Commerce Clause, of its own force, gives the residents of one State the right to control in this fashion the terms of resource development and depletion in a sister State.  <em>Cf. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html#626">437 U. S. 626</a></span>. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 453 U. S. 620</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In any event, appellants\' discrimination theory ultimately collapses into their claim that the Montana tax is invalid under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test:  that the tax is not "fairly related to the services provided by the State."  430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html#279">430 U. S. 279</a></span>.  Because appellants concede that Montana may impose <em>some</em> severance tax on coal mined in the State, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the only remaining foundation for their discrimination theory is a claim that the tax burden borne by the out-of-state consumers of Montana coal is excessive.  This is, of course, merely a variant of appellants\' assertion that the Montana tax does not satisfy the "fairly related" prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test, and it is to this contention that we now turn.</p>\n<p>Appellants argue that they are entitled to an opportunity to prove that the amount collected under the Montana tax is not fairly related to the additional costs the State incurs because of coal mining. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Thus, appellants\' objection is to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="621">Page 453 U. S. 621</a></p><p> the rate of the Montana tax, and even then, their only complaint is that the amount the State receives in taxes far exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  In objecting to the tax on this ground, appellants may be assuming that the Montana tax is, in fact, intended to reimburse the State for the cost of specific services furnished to the coal mining industry.  Alternatively, appellants could be arguing that a State\'s power to tax an activity connected to interstate commerce cannot exceed the value of the services specifically provided to the activity.  Either way, the premise of appellants\' argument is invalid.  Furthermore, appellants have completely misunderstood the nature of the inquiry under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test.</p>\n<p>The Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax is "imposed for the general support of the government."  ___ Mont. at ___, 615 P.2d at 856, and we have no reason to question this characterization of the Montana tax as a general revenue tax. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Consequently, in reviewing appellants\' contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to "user" fees or "taxes" that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/707/case.html">405 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court has indicated that States have considerable latitude in imposing general revenue taxes.  The Court has, for example, consistently rejected claims that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as a barrier against taxes that are "unreasonable" or "unduly burdensome."  <em>See, e.g., Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/369/case.html">417 U. S. 369</a></span> (1974); <em>Magnano Co. v.

Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/44/case.html">255 U. S. 44</a></span> (1921).  Moreover, there is no requirement under the Due Process Clause that the amount of general revenue taxes collected from a particular activity must be reasonably related to the value of the services provided to the activity.  Instead, our consistent rule has been:</p>\n<p>"Nothing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure, and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied."</p>\n<p>"A tax is not an assessment of benefits.  It is, as we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 453 U. S. 623</a></p><p> have said, a means of distributing the burden of the cost of government.  The only benefit to which the taxpayer is constitutionally entitled is that derived from his enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society, established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes.  Any other view would preclude the levying of taxes except as they are used to compensate for the burden on those who pay them, and would involve abandonment of the most fundamental principle of government -- that it exists primarily to provide for the common good."</p>\n<p><em>Carmichael v.

The entire value of the coal, before transportation, originates in the State, and mining of the coal depletes the resource base and wealth of the State, thereby diminishing a future source of taxes and economic activity.

In many respects, a severance tax is like a real property tax, which has never been doubted as a legitimate means of raising revenue by the situs State (quite apart from the right of that or any other State to tax income derived from use of the property).  <em>See, e.g., Old Dominion S.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Rather, the test is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="626">Page 453 U.

Under this threshold test, the interstate business must have a substantial nexus with the State before any tax may be levied on it.  <em>See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v.

Beyond that threshold requirement, the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test imposes the additional limitation that the measure of the tax must be reasonably related to the extent of the contact, since it is the activities or presence of the taxpayer in the State that may properly be made to bear a "just share of state tax burden," <em>Western Live Stock v.

This assertion reveals that appellants labor under a misconception about a court\'s role in cases such as this. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The simple fact is that the appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, and not judicial, resolution.

In essence, appellants ask this Court to prescribe a test for the validity of state taxes that would require state and federal courts, as a matter of federal constitutional law, to calculate acceptable rates or levels of taxation of activities that are conceded to be legitimate subjects of taxation.  This we decline to do.</p>\n<p>In the first place, it is doubtful whether any legal test could adequately reflect the numerous and competing economic, geographic, demographic, social, and political considerations that must inform a decision about an acceptable rate or level of state taxation, and yet be reasonably capable of application in a wide variety of individual cases.  But even apart from the difficulty of the judicial undertaking, the nature of the factfinding and judgment that would be required of the courts merely reinforces the conclusion that questions about the appropriate level of state taxes must be resolved through the political process.  Under our federal system, the determination is to be made by state legislatures in the first instance, and, if necessary, by Congress when particular state taxes are thought to be contrary to federal interests. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  <em>Cf. Mobil Oil Corp. v.

Rather, when the measure of a tax is reasonably related to the taxpayer\'s activities or presence in the State -- from which it derives some benefit such as the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 453 U.

Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers\' presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce.  <em>See Nippert v. Richmond,</em> 327 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/416/case.html#427">327 U. S. 427</a></span>; <em>cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/157/case.html">347 U. S. 157</a></span> (1954).  We are satisfied that the Montana tax assessed under a formula that relates the tax liability to the value of appellant coal producers\' activities within the State comports with the requirements of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test.  We therefore turn to appellants\' contention that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the Montana tax, as applied to mining of federally owned coal, is invalid under the Supremacy Clause because it "substantially frustrates" the purposes of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, ch. 85, 41 Stat. 437, 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 181 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III) (1920 Act), as amended by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975, Pub.L. 94-377, 90 Stat. 1083 (1975 Amendments).  Appellants argue that, under the 1920 Act, the "economic rents" attributable to the mining of coal on federal land -- <em>i.e.,</em> the difference between the cost of production (including a reasonable profit) and the market price of the coal -- are to be captured by the Federal Government in the form of royalty payments from federal lessees.  The payments thus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 453 U. S. 630</a></p><p> received are then to be divided between the States and the Federal Government according to a formula prescribed by the Act. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]   In appellants\' view, the Montana tax seriously undercuts and disrupts the 1920 Act\'s division of revenues between the Federal and State Governments by appropriating directly to Montana a major portion of the "economic rents."  Appellants contend the Montana tax will alter the statutory scheme by causing potential coal producers to reduce the amount they are willing to bid in royalties on federal leases.  As an initial matter, we note that this argument rests on a factual premise -- that the principal effect of the tax is to shift a major portion of the relatively fixed "economic rents" attributable to the extraction of federally owned coal from the Federal Treasury to the State of Montana -- that appears to be inconsistent with the premise of appellants\' Commerce Clause claims.  In pressing their Commerce Clause arguments, appellants assert that the Montana tax increases the cost of Montana coal, thereby <em>increasing</em> the total amount of "economic rents," and that the burden of the tax is borne by out-of-state consumers, not the Federal Treasury. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  But </p><p><a class="page-number" name="631">Page 453 U. S. 631</a></p><p> even assuming that the Montana tax may reduce royalty payments to the Federal Government under leases executed in Montana, this fact alone hardly demonstrates that the tax is inconsistent with the 1920 Act.  Indeed, appellants\' argument is substantially undermined by the fact that, in \xc2\xa7 32 of the 1920 Act, 41 Stat. 450, 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 189, Congress expressly authorized the States to impose severance taxes on federal lessees without imposing any limits on the amount of such taxes.  Section 32, as set forth in 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 189, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed or held to affect the rights of the States or other local authority to exercise any rights which they may have, including the right to levy and collect taxes upon improvements, output of mines, or other rights, property, or assets of any lessee of the United States."</p>\n<p>This Court had occasion to construe \xc2\xa7 32 soon after it was enacted.  The Court explained:</p>\n<p>"Congress . . . meant by the proviso to say, in effect, that, although the act deals with the letting of public lands and the relations of the [federal] government to the lessees thereof, nothing in it shall be so construed as to affect the right of the states, in respect of such private persons and corporations, to <em>levy and collect taxes as though the government were not concerned. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"We think the proviso plainly discloses the intention of Congress that <em>persons and corporations contracting with the United States under the act should not, for that reason, be exempt from any form of state taxation otherwise</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 453 U. S. 632</a></p><p> <em>lawful.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/45/case.html">268 U. S. 45</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/45/case.html#48">268 U. S. 48</a></span>-50 (1925) (emphasis added).  It necessarily follows that, if the Montana tax is "otherwise lawful," the 1920 Act does not forbid it.</p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the Montana tax is not "otherwise lawful," because it conflicts with the very purpose of the 1920 Act.  We do not agree.  There is nothing in the language or legislative history of either the 1920 Act or the 1975 Amendments to support appellants\' assertion that Congress intended to maximize and capture <em>all</em> "economic rents" from the mining of federal coal, and then to distribute the proceeds in accordance with the statutory formula.  The House Report on the 1975 Amendments, for example, speaks only in terms of a congressional intent to secure a "fair return to the public."  H.R.Rep. No. 94-681, pp. 17-18 (1975).  Moreover, appellants\' argument proves too much.  By definition, any state taxation of federal lessees reduces the "economic rents" accruing to the Federal Government, and appellants\' argument would preclude any such taxes, despite the explicit grant of taxing authority to the States by \xc2\xa7 32.  Finally, appellants\' contention necessarily depends on inferences to be drawn from \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7 and 35 of the 1920 Act, 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 207 and 191 which, as amended, prescribe the statutory formula for the division of the payments received by the Federal Government.  <em>See</em> Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 38-41, J.S.App. 57a-58a.  Yet \xc2\xa7 32 of the 1920 Act, as set forth in 30 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 189, states that "[n]othing in this chapter" -- which includes \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7 and 35 -- "shall be construed or held to affect the rights of the States . . . to levy and collect taxes upon . . . output of mines . . . of any lessee of the United States."  And if, as the Court has held, the States may "levy and collect taxes as though the [federal] government were not concerned," <em>Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/45/case.html#49">268 U. S. 49</a></span>, the manner in which the Federal Government collects receipts from its lessees and then shares them with the States has no bearing on the validity of a state tax.  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 453 U. S. 633</a></p><p> therefore reject appellants\' contention that the Montana tax must be invalidated as inconsistent with the Mineral Lands Leasing Act.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The final issue we must consider is appellants\' assertion that the Montana tax is unconstitutional because it substantially frustrates national energy policies, reflected in several federal statutes, encouraging the production and use of coal, particularly low-sulfur coal such as is found in Montana.  Appellants insist that they are entitled to a hearing to explore the contours of these national policies and to adduce evidence supporting their claim that the Montana tax substantially frustrates and impairs the policies.</p>\n<p>We cannot quarrel with appellants\' recitation of federal statutes encouraging the use of coal.  Appellants correctly note that \xc2\xa7 2(6) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 874, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6201(6), declares that one of the Act\'s purposes is</p>\n<p>"to reduce the demand for petroleum products and natural gas through programs designed to provide greater availability and use of this Nation\'s abundant coal resources."</p>\n<p>And \xc2\xa7 102(b)(3) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (PIFUA), 92 Stat. 3291, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8301(b)(3) (1976 ed., Supp. III), recites a similar objective "to encourage and foster the greater use of coal and other alternate fuels, in lieu of natural gas and petroleum, as a primary energy source."  We do not, however, accept appellants\' implicit suggestion that these general statements demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt all state legislation that may have an adverse impact on the use of coal.  In <em>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/case.html">437 U. S. 117</a></span> (1978), we rejected a preemption argument similar to the one appellants urge here.  There, it was argued that the "basic national policy favoring free competition" reflected in the Sherman Act preempted a state law regulating retail distribution of gasoline.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/case.html#133">437 U.

In cases such as this, it is necessary to look beyond general expressions of "national policy" to specific federal statutes with which the state law is claimed to conflict. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The only specific statutory provisions favoring the use of coal cited by appellants are those in PIFUA.</p>\n<p>PIFUA prohibits new electric power plants or new major fuel-burning installations from using natural gas or petroleum as a primary energy source, and prohibits existing facilities from using natural gas as a primary energy source after 1989.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8311(1), 8312(a) (1976 ed., Supp. III).  Appellants contend that "the manifest purpose of this Act to favor the use of coal is clear."  Brief for Appellants 37.  As the statute itself makes clear, however, Congress did not intend PIFUA to preempt state severance taxes on coal.  Section 601(a)(1) of PIFUA, 92 Stat. 3323, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8401(a)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. III), provides for federal financial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 453 U. S. 635</a></p><p> assistance to areas of a State adversely affected by increased coal or uranium mining, based upon findings by the Governor of the State that the state or local government lacks the financial resources to meet increased demand for housing or public services and facilities in such areas.  Section 601(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8401(a)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. III), then provides that</p>\n<p>"increased revenues, <em>including severance tax revenues,</em> royalties, and similar fees to the State and local governments which are associated with the increase in coal or uranium development activities . . . shall be taken into account in determining if a State or local government lacks financial resources."</p>\n<p>This section clearly contemplates the continued existence, not the preemption, of state severance taxes on coal and other minerals.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 601(a)(2) reveals that Congress enacted this provision with Montana\'s tax specifically in mind.  The Senate version of the PIFUA bill provided for impact aid, but the House bill did not.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1749, p. 93 (1978).  The Senate\'s proposal for impact aid was opposed by the House conferees, who took the position that the States would be able to satisfy the demand for additional facilities and services caused by increased coal production through imposition of severance taxes and, in Western States, through royalties received under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act.  <em>See</em> Transcript of the Joint Conference on Energy 1822, 1824, 1832, 1834-1837, 1839 (1977) (Tr.), reprinted in 2 U.S. Dept. of Energy, Legislative History:  Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, 777, 779, 787, 789-792, 794 (1978) (Legislative History).  In explaining the objections of the House conferees, Representative Eckhardt pointed out:</p>\n<p>"[T]he western states may collect severance taxes on that coal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 453 U. S. 636</a></p><p> "</p>\n<p>"As I pointed out [<em>see</em> Tr. 1822, Legislative History, at 777], Montana already collects $3 a ton on severance taxes on coal and still enjoys a 50 percent royalty return.  As the price of coal goes up . . . , these severance taxes, in addition, go up."</p>\n<p>"This is a percentage tax, not a flat tax in most instances."</p>\n<p>"If we are going to merely determine on the basis of impact on a particular community in a state how much money is going to go to that community, without taking into account how much that community is enriched, I think we are going to have people who are so angry at us in Congress. . . ."</p>\n<p>Tr. 1835, Legislative History, at 790  Section 601(a)(2) was obviously included in PIFUA as a response to these concerns, for it provides that severance taxes and royalties are to be "taken into account" in determining eligibility for impact aid.  The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 601(a)(2) thus confirms what seems evident from the face of the statute -- that Montana\'s severance tax is not preempted by PIFUA.  Since PIFUA is the only federal statute that even comes close to providing a specific basis for appellants\' claims that the Montana statute "substantially frustrates" federal energy policies, this aspect of appellants\' Supremacy Clause argument must also fail. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In sum, we conclude that appellants have failed to demonstrate either that the Montana tax suffers from any of the constitutional defects alleged in their complaints or that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 453 U.

The threshold questions whether a State enjoys a "monopoly" position and whether the tax burden is shifted out of state, rather than borne by in-state producers and consumers, would require complex factual inquiries about such issues as elasticity of demand for the product and alternative sources of supply.  Moreover, under this approach, the constitutionality of a state tax could well turn on whether the in-state producer is able, through sales contracts or otherwise, to shift the burden of the tax forward to its out-of-state customers.

The Clean Air Act does not mandate the use of coal; it merely prescribes standards governing the emission of sulfur dioxide when coal is used.  Any effect those standards might have on the use of high or low sulphur coal is incidental.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.</p>\n<p>This is a very troublesome case for me, and I join the Court\'s opinion with considerable doubt and with the realization that Montana\'s levy on consumers in other States may, in the long run, prove to be an intolerable and unacceptable burden on commerce.  Indeed, there is particular force in the argument that the tax is here and now unconstitutional.  Montana collects most of its tax from coal lands owned by the Federal Government, and hence by all of the people of this country, while at the same time sharing equally and directly with the Federal Government all of the royalties reserved under the leases the United States has negotiated on its land in the State of Montana.  This share is intended to compensate the State for the burdens that coal mining may impose upon it.  Also, as JUSTICE BLACKMUN cogently points out, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/609/case.html#643">453 U. S. 643</a></span>, n. 9 another 40% of the federal revenue from mineral leases is indirectly returned to the States through a reclamation fund.  In addition, there is statutory provision for federal grants to areas affected by increased coal production.</p>\n<p>But this very fact gives me pause and counsels withholding our hand, at least for now.  Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even undesirable burdens.  It is also very much aware of the Nation\'s energy needs, of the Montana tax, and of the trend in the energy-rich States to aggrandize their position and perhaps lessen the tax burdens on their own citizens by imposing unusually high taxes on mineral extraction.  Yet Congress is so far content to let the matter rest, and we are counseled by the Executive Branch through the Solicitor General not to overturn the Montana tax as inconsistent with either the Commerce Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 453 U. S. 638</a></p><p> or federal statutory policy in the field of energy or otherwise.  The constitutional authority and the machinery to thwart efforts such as those of Montana, if thought unacceptable, are available to Congress, and surely Montana and other similarly situated States do not have the political power to impose their will on the rest of the country.  As I presently see it, therefore, the better part of both wisdom and valor is to respect the judgment of the other branches of the Government.

Approximately 70-75% of Montana\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="639">Page 453 U.

S. 617</span>-618 -- is exported to other States pursuant to long-term purchase contracts with out-of-state utilities.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, pp. 3-4 (1980).  Those contracts typically provide that the costs of state taxation shall be passed on to the utilities; in turn, fuel adjustment clauses allow the utilities to pass the cost of taxation along to their consumers.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because federal environmental legislation has increased the demand for low-sulfur coal, <em>id.</em> at 3, and because the Montana coal fields occupy a "pivotal" geographic position in the midwestern and northwestern energy markets, <em>see</em> J. Krutilla &amp; A. Fisher with R. Rice, Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Coal Development:  Northern Great Plains xvi (1978) (Krutilla), Montana has supplied an increasing percentage of the Nation\'s coal.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  The Committees pointed out, however, that the Province of Alberta, Canada, recently had raised sharply its royalty on natural gas, thereby forcing consumers of Alberta gas in Montana and elsewhere to finance involuntarily Alberta\'s "universities, hospitals, reduction of other taxes, etc."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Stating that "we should . . . look north to Alberta," the Conference Committees observed:</p>\n<p>"While coal is not as scarce as natural gas, most of the Montana coal now produced is committed for sale under long-term contracts, and will be purchased with this tax added to its price."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The Committees noted that, although some new coal contracts might shift to Wyoming to take advantage of that State\'s lower severance tax, Montana\'s severance tax was comparable to that recently enacted by North Dakota. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Thus, the Committees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="641">Page 453 U.

[<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>As the Montana Legislature foresaw, the imposition of this severance tax has generated enormous revenues for the State.  Montana collected $33.6 million in severance taxes in fiscal year 1978, H.R.Rep.

In 1972, the then-current flat rate severance tax on coal provided only 0.4% of Montana\'s total tax revenue; in contrast, in the year following the 1975 amendment, the coal severance tax supplied 11.4% of the State\'s total tax revenue.  <em>See</em> Griffin &amp; Shelton, Coal Severance Tax Policies in the Rocky Mountain States, 7 Policy Studies J. 29, 33 (1978) (Griffin).  Appellants assert that the tax now supplies almost 20% of the State\'s total revenue.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.  Indeed, the funds generated by the tax have been so large that, beginning in 1980, at least 50% of the severance tax is to be transferred and dedicated to a permanent trust fund, the principal of which must "forever remain inviolate" unless appropriated by a vote of three-fourths of the members of each house of the legislature.

Moreover, in 1979, Montana passed legislation providing property and income tax relief for state residents. 1979 Mont.Laws, ch. 698.</p>\n<p>Appellants\' complaint alleged that Montana\'s severance tax is ultimately borne by out-of-state consumers, and, for the purposes of this appeal, that allegation is to be treated a true. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Appellants further alleged that the tax bears no reasonable relationship to the services or protection provided by the State.  The issue here, of course, is whether they are entitled to a trial on that claim, not whether they will succeed on the merits.  It should be noted, however, that Montana imposes numerous other taxes upon coal mining. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  In addition, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 453 U. S. 643</a></p><p> because 70 to 75 of the coal-bearing land in Montana is owned by the Federal Government, Montana derives a large amount of coal mining revenue from the United States as well. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  In light of these circumstances, the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives concluded that Montana\'s coal severance tax results in revenues "far in excess of the direct and indirect impact costs attributable to the coal production."  H.R.Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 2 (1980).  Several commentators have agreed that Montana and other similarly situated Western States have pursued a policy of "OPEC-like revenue maximization," and that the Montana tax accordingly bears no reasonable relationship to the services and protection afforded by the State.

Appellants concede, and the Court properly concludes, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 453 U.

The Court also correctly observes that Montana\'s severance tax is facially neutral.  It does not automatically follow, however, that the Montana severance tax does not unduly burden or interfere with interstate commerce.  The gravamen of appellants\' complaint is that the severance tax does not satisfy the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test, because it is tailored to, and does, force interstate commerce to pay <em>more</em> than its way.  Under our established precedents, appellants are entitled to a trial on this claim.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s conclusion to the contrary rests on the premise that the relevant inquiry under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test is simply whether the measure of the tax is fixed as a percentage of the value of the coal taken.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/609/case.html#626">453 U. S. 626</a></span>.  This interpretation emasculates the fourth prong.  No trial will ever be necessary on the issue of fair relationship so long as a State is careful to impose a proportional, rather than a flat tax, rate; thus, the Court\'s rule is no less "mechanical" than the approach entertained in <em>Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/245/case.html">260 U.

[<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Under the Court\'s reasoning, any <em>ad valorem</em> tax will satisfy the fourth prong; indeed, the Court implicitly ratifies Montana\'s contention that it is free to tax this coal at 100% or even l,000% of value, should it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="646">Page 453 U.

S. 650</a></p><p> the Court\'s cases suggest that we require a closer "fit" under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test than when interstate commerce has not been singled out by the challenged tax.</p>\n<p>As a number of commentators have noted, state severance taxes upon minerals are particularly susceptible to "tailoring."  "Like a tollgate lying athwart a trade route, a severance or processing tax conditions access to natural resources."  Developments in the Law:  Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 953, 970 (1962).  Thus, to the extent that the taxing jurisdiction approaches a monopoly position in the mineral, and consumption is largely outside the State, such taxes are "[e]conomically and politically analogous to transportation taxes exploiting geographical position."  Brown, The Open Economy:  Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L.J. 219, 232 (1957) (Brown).  <em>See also</em> Hellerstein, Constitutional Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat.Tax J. 245, 249-250 (1978); R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 510-514 (2d ed.1977) (Posner).  But just as a port State may require that imports pay their own way even though the tax levied increases the cost of goods purchased by inland customers, <em>see Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/276/case.html">423 U. S. 276</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/276/case.html#288">423 U. S. 288</a></span> (1976), [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] so also may a mineral-rich State require that those who consume its resources pay a fair share of the general costs of government, as well as the specific costs attributable to the commerce itself.  Thus, the mere fact that the burden of a severance tax is largely shifted forward to out-of-state consumers does not, standing alone, make out a Commerce Clause violation.  <em>See</em> Hellerstein, <em>supra,</em> at 249.  But the Clause is violated when, as appellants allege is the case here, the State effectively selects</p>\n<p>"a class of out-of-state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 453 U.

S. 619</a></span>, n. 8. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  I do not believe, however, that this threshold inquiry is beyond judicial competence. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  If the trial court were to determine that the tax is exported, it would then have to determine whether the tax is "fairly related," within the meaning of <em>Complete Auto Transit.</em>  The Court to the contrary, this would not require the trial court "to second-guess legislative decisions about the amount or disposition of tax revenues."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/609/case.html#627">453 U.

As noted above, Montana\'s severance tax already allegedly accounts for 20% of its total tax revenue, and the State has enacted property and income tax relief.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court apparently derives its interpretation of the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit</em> test primarily from <em>Wisconsin v.

In neither of those cases, however did the Court consider the question presented here.  <em>J. C. Penney</em> involved a Fourteenth Amendment challenge brought by a foreign corporation to a Wisconsin tax imposed on domestic and foreign corporations "for the privilege of declaring . . . dividends" out of income from property located and business transacted in Wisconsin.  The corporation argued that, because the income from the Wisconsin transactions had been transferred to New York, Wisconsin had "no jurisdiction to tax" those amounts.  311 U.S. at 436 [argument of counsel omitted from electronic version].  The Court rejected that argument, holding that</p>\n<p>"[t]he fact that a tax is contingent upon events brought to pass without a state does not destroy the nexus between such a tax and transactions within a state for which the tax is an exaction."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/435/case.html#445">311 U.

The Court concluded that there was a sufficient nexus to uphold the tax.  377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/436/case.html#448">377 U.

The Court sustained the validity of the license tax on the ground that it was simply a nondiscriminatory "exercise of the police power . . . for revenue purposes."  249 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/252/case.html#257">249 U. S. 257</a></span>.  In contrast, the pole tax was subjected to stricter scrutiny; the Court stated that, while interstate commerce must pay its way, the authority remains in the courts,</p>\n<p>"on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/252/case.html#260">249 U.

Delta Airlines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/707/case.html">405 U. S. 707</a></span> (1972); <em>Clark v.

In analyzing such taxes, it has required that there be factual evidence in the record that "the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered."  <em>Clark,</em> 306 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/583/case.html#599">306 U. S. 599</a></span>.  The Court concludes that this test has no bearing here because the Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax was "<em>imposed for the general support of the government.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/609/case.html#621">453 U. S. 621</a></span>.  In fact, however, the matter is not nearly so clear as the Court suggests.  The Montana court also implied that the tax was designed at least in part to compensate the State for the special costs attributable to coal mining, ___ Mont. at ___, ___ , 615 P.2d at 850, 855, as have appellees here.  Brief for Appellees 1-3, 26-27.\n</em></p>\n<p>Indeed, the stated objectives of the 1975 amendment were to:</p>\n<p>"(a) preserve or modestly increase revenues going to the general fund,(b) to respond to current social impacts attributable to coal development, and (c) to invest in the future, when new energy technologies reduce our dependence on coal and mining activity may decline."</p>\n<p>Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  Since the tax was designed only to "preserve or modestly increase" general revenues, it is appropriate for a court to inquire here whether the "surplus" revenue Montana has received from this severance tax is "manifestly disproportionate" to the present or future costs attributable to coal development.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/14" name="F2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Complete Auto Transit</em> gave several examples of "tailored" taxes:  property taxes designed to differentiate between property used in transportation and other types of property; an income tax using different rates for different types of business; and a tax on the "privilege of doing business in corporate form" that changed with the nature of the corporate activity involved.  430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html#288">430 U.

Indeed, whereas Montana argues that the question presented here is one better left to Congress, in 1980 hearings before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the then Governor of Montana took the position that the reasonableness of this tax was "a question most properly left to the court," not a congressional committee.  <em>See</em> Hearing on S. 2695 before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 237 (1980).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice Holmes\' words are relevant:</p>\n<p>"I do not think the United States would come to an end if we lost our power to declare an Act of Congress void.
