Matrixx moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that respondents had not pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the element of scienter.  The District Court granted the motion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that the District Court erred in requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish materiality, concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged information linking Zicam and anosmia that would have been significant to a reasonable investor.  It also held that Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s withholding of information about reports of adverse effects and about pending lawsuits by Zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Respondents have stated a claim under \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.

S. 224</a>, \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement is satisfied when there is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 231\xe2\x80\x93232.  The Court declined to adopt a bright-line rule for determining materiality in <em>Basic</em>, observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 236.  Here, Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s bright-line rule\xe2\x80\x94that adverse event reports regarding a pharmaceutical company\xe2\x80\x99s products are not material absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statistically significant risk that the product is causing the events\xe2\x80\x94would \xe2\x80\x9cartificially exclud[e]\xe2\x80\x9d information that \xe2\x80\x9cwould otherwise be considered significant to [a reasonable investor\xe2\x80\x99s] trading decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s premise that statistical significance is the only reliable indication of causation is flawed.  Both medical experts and the Food and Drug Administration rely on evidence other than statistically significant data to establish an inference of causation.  It thus stands to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence.  Because adverse reports can take many forms, assessing their materiality is a fact-specific inquiry, requiring consideration of their source, content, and context.  The question is whether a <em>reasonable</em> investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as having significantly altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 232.  Something more than the mere existence of adverse event reports is needed to satisfy that standard, but that something more is not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source, content, and context of the reports.

The complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations suffice to \xe2\x80\x9craise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\xe2\x80\x9d satisfying the materiality requirement, <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html">550 U.

Assuming the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to be true, Matrixx received reports from medical experts and researchers that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between Zicam and anosmia.  Consumers likely would have viewed Zicam\xe2\x80\x99s risk as substantially outweighing its benefit.  Viewing the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s leading product.  It is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as having significantly altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Basic</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 232.  Assuming the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to be true, Matrixx told the market that revenues were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent when it had information indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating product.  It also publicly dismissed reports linking Zicam and anosmia and stated that zinc gluconate\xe2\x80\x99s safety was well established, when it had evidence of a biological link between Zicam\xe2\x80\x99s key ingredient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that link.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Tellabs, Inc.</em> v. <em>Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/308/index.html">551 U. S. 308</a>, 319.  This Court assumes, without deciding, that the scienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness.  Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a complaint adequately pleads scienter \xe2\x80\x9conly if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 324.  Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s proposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed.  The complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, \xe2\x80\x9ctaken collectively,\xe2\x80\x9d give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9ccogent and compelling\xe2\x80\x9d inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose adverse event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but because it understood their likely effect on the market.  <em>Id.,</em> at 323, 324.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] reasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d would deem the inference that Matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness \xe2\x80\x9cat least as compelling as any [plausible] opposing inference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 324.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b),  and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2010), based on a pharmaceutical company\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose reports of adverse events associated with a product if the reports do not disclose a statistically significant number of adverse events.  Respondents, plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action, allege that petitioners, Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., and three of its executives (collectively Matrixx), failed to disclose reports of a possible link between its leading product, a cold remedy, and loss of smell, rendering statements made by Matrixx misleading.  Matrixx contends that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint does not adequately allege that Matrixx made a material representation or omission or that it acted with scienter because the complaint does not allege that Matrixx knew of a statistically significant number of adverse events requiring disclosure.  We conclude that the materiality of adverse event reports cannot be reduced to a bright-line rule.  Although in many cases reasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse events to be material information, respondents have alleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors would have viewed these particular reports as material.  Respondents have also alleged facts \xe2\x80\x9cgiving rise to a strong inference\xe2\x80\x9d that Matrixx \xe2\x80\x9cacted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(2)(A) (Feb. 2011 Supp.).  We therefore hold, in agreement with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that respondents have stated a claim under \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Through a wholly owned subsidiary, Matrixx develops, manufactures, and markets over-the-counter pharmaceutical products.  Its core brand of products is called Zicam.  All of the products sold under the name Zicam are used to treat the common cold and associated symptoms.  At the time of the events in question, one of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s products was Zicam Cold Remedy, which came in several forms including nasal spray and gel.  The active ingredient in Zicam Cold Remedy was zinc gluconate.  Respondents allege that Zicam Cold Remedy accounted for approximately 70 percent of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s sales.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents initiated this securities fraud class action against Matrixx on behalf of individuals who purchased Matrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and February 6, 2004.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The action principally arises out of statements that Matrixx made during the class period relating to revenues and product safety.  Respondents claim that Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s statements were misleading in light of reports that Matrixx had received, but did not disclose, about consumers who had lost their sense of smell (a condition called anosmia) after using Zicam Cold Remedy.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 consolidated amended complaint alleges the following facts, which the courts below properly assumed to be true.  See <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Iqbal</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, Dr. Alan Hirsch, neurological director of the Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, Ltd., called Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s customer service line after discovering a possible link between Zicam nasal gel and a loss of smell \xe2\x80\x9cin a cluster of his patients.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 67a\xe2\x80\x9368a.  Dr. Hirsch told a Matrixx employee that \xe2\x80\x9cprevious studies had demonstrated that intranasal application of zinc could be problematic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 68a.  He also told the employee about at least one of his patients who did not have a cold and who developed anosmia after using Zicam.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2002, Timothy Clarot, Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s vice president for research and development, called Miriam Linschoten, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center after receiving a complaint from a per-\nson Linschoten was treating who had lost her sense of\nsmell after using Zicam.  Clarot informed Linschoten that\nMatrixx had received similar complaints from other customers.  Linschoten drew Clarot\xe2\x80\x99s attention to \xe2\x80\x9cprevious studies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Clarot gave her the impression that he had not heard of the studies.  She asked Clarot whether Matrixx had done any studies of its own; he responded that it had not but that it had hired a consultant to review the product.  Soon thereafter, Linschoten sent Clarot abstracts of the studies she had mentioned.  Research from the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s and 1980\xe2\x80\x99s had confirmed \xe2\x80\x9c[z]inc\xe2\x80\x99s toxicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 69a.  Clarot called Linschoten to ask whether she would be willing to participate in animal studies that Matrixx was planning, but she declined because her focus was human research.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By September 2003, one of Linschoten\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues at the University of Colorado, Dr. Bruce Jafek, had observed 10 patients suffering from anosmia after Zicam use.  Linschoten and Jafek planned to present their findings at a meeting of the American Rhinologic Society in a poster presentation entitled \xe2\x80\x9cZicam<font super="1">\xc2\xae Induced Anosmia.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The American Rhinologic Society posted their abstract in advance of the meeting.  The presentation described in detail a 55-year-old man with previously normal taste and smell who experienced severe burning in his nose, followed immediately by a loss of smell, after using Zicam.  It also reported 10 other Zicam users with similar symptoms.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Matrixx learned of the doctors\xe2\x80\x99 planned presentation.  Clarot sent a letter to Dr. Jafek warning him that he did not have permission to use Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s name or the names of its products.  Dr. Jafek deleted the references to Zicam in the poster before presenting it to the American Rhinologic Society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following month, two plaintiffs commenced a product liability lawsuit against Matrixx alleging that Zicam had damaged their sense of smell.  By the end of the class period on February 6, 2004, nine plaintiffs had filed four lawsuits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents allege that Matrixx made a series of public statements that were misleading in light of the foregoing information.  In October 2003, after they had learned of Dr. Jafek\xe2\x80\x99s study and after Dr. Jafek had presented his findings to the American Rhinologic Society, Matrixx stated that Zicam was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98poised for growth in the upcoming cough and cold season\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that the company had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98very strong momentum.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 72a\xe2\x80\x9374a.  Matrixx further expressed its expectation that revenues would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be up in excess of 50% and that earnings, per share for the full year [would] be in the 25 to 30 cent range.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 74a.  In January 2004, Matrixx raised its revenue guidance, predicting an increase in revenues of 80 percent and earnings per share in the 33-to-38-cent range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its Form 10\xe2\x80\x93Q filed with the SEC in November 2003, Zicam warned of the potential \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98material adverse effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that could result from product liability claims, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whether or not proven to be valid.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 75a\xe2\x80\x9376a.  It stated that product liability actions could materially affect Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98product branding and goodwill,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d leading to reduced customer acceptance.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 76a.  It did not disclose, however, that two plaintiffs had already sued Matrixx for allegedly causing them to lose their sense of smell.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 30, 2004, Dow Jones Newswires reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98looking into complaints that an over-the-counter common-cold medicine manufactured by a unit of Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. (MTXX) may be causing some users to lose their sense of smell\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in light of at least three product liability lawsuits.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79a\xe2\x80\x9380a.  Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s stock fell from $13.55 to $11.97 per share after the report.  In response, on February 2, Matrixx issued a press release that stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAll Zicam products are manufactured and marketed according to FDA guidelines for homeopathic medicine.  Our primary concern is the health and safety of our customers and the distribution of fac-\ntual information about our products.  Matrixx believes statements alleging that intranasal Zicam products caused anosmia (loss of smell) are completely unfounded and misleading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel products has there been a single report of lost or diminished olfactory function (sense of smell).  Rather, the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials.  In fact, in neither study were there any reports of anosmia related to the use of this compound.  The overall incidence of adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was extremely low, with no statistically significant difference between the adverse event rates for the treated and placebo subsets.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA multitude of environmental and biologic influences are known to affect the sense of smell.  Chief among them is the common cold.  As a result, the population most likely to use cold remedy products is already at increased risk of developing anosmia.  Other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include age, nasal and sinus infections, head trauma, anatomical obstructions, and environmental irritants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 77a\xe2\x80\x9378a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe day after Matrixx issued this press release, its stock price bounced back to $13.40 per share.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 6, 2004, the end of the class period, Good Morning America, a nationally broadcast morning news program, highlighted Dr. Jafek\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  (The complaint does not allege that Matrixx learned of the news story before its broadcast.)  The program reported that Dr. Jafek had discovered more than a dozen patients suffering from anosmia after using Zicam.  It also noted that four lawsuits had been filed against Matrixx.  The price of Matrixx stock plummeted to $9.94 per share that same day.  Zicam again issued a press release largely repeating its February 2 statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 19, 2004, Matrixx filed a Form 8\xe2\x80\x93K with the SEC stating that it had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98convened a two-day meeting of physicians and scientists to review current information on smell disorders\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in response to Dr. Jafek\xe2\x80\x99s presentation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 82a.  According to the Form 8\xe2\x80\x93K, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98In the opinion of the panel, there is insufficient scientific evidence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate, when used as recommended, affects a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to smell.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  A few weeks later, a reporter quoted Matrixx as stating that it would begin conducting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98animal and human studies to further characterize these post-marketing complaints.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 84a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the basis of these allegations, respondents claimed that Matrixx violated \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 by making untrue statements of fact and failing to disclose material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading in an effort to maintain artificially high prices for Matrixx securities.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Matrixx moved to dismiss respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, arguing that they had failed to plead the elements of a material misstatement or omission and scienter.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  Relying on <em>In\xc2\xa0re Carter-Wallace, Inc., Securities Litigation</em>, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 36 (CA2 2000), it held that respondents had not alleged a \xe2\x80\x9cstatistically significant correlation between the use of Zicam and anosmia so as to make failure to public[ly] disclose complaints and the University of Colorado study a material omission.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a.

The defendant urged a bright-line rule that preliminary merger negotiations are material only once the parties to the negotiations reach an agreement in principle.  <em>Id.</em>, at 232\xe2\x80\x93233.  We observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative of an inherently fact-specific finding such as materiality, must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 236.

Accordingly,\nit contends, reasonable investors would not consider such reports relevant unless they are statistically significant because only then do they \xe2\x80\x9creflect a scientifically reliable basis for inferring a potential causal link between product use and the adverse event.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Basic</em>, Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rule would \xe2\x80\x9cartificially exclud[e]\xe2\x80\x9d information that \xe2\x80\x9cwould otherwise be considered significant to the trading decision of a reasonable investor.\xe2\x80\x9d  485 U. S., at 236.  Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on the premise that statistical significance is the only reliable indication of causation.  This premise is flawed: As the SEC points out, \xe2\x80\x9cmedical researchers . . . consider multiple factors in assessing causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12.  Statistically significant data are not always available.  For example, when an adverse event is subtle or rare, \xe2\x80\x9can inability to obtain a data set of appropriate quality or quantity may preclude a finding of statistical significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 15; see also Brief for Medical Researchers as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11.  Moreover, ethical considerations may prohibit researchers from conducting randomized clinical trials to confirm a suspected causal link for the purpose of obtaining statistically significant data.  See <em>id.</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A lack of statistically significant data does not mean that medical experts have no reliable basis for inferring a causal link between a drug and adverse events.  As Matrixx itself concedes, medical experts rely on other evidence to establish an inference of causation.  See Brief for Petitioners 44\xe2\x80\x9345, n. 22.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  We note that courts frequently permit expert testimony on causation based on evidence other than statistical significance.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Best</em> v. <em>Lowe\xe2\x80\x99s Home Centers, Inc.</em>, 563 F.\xc2\xa03d 171, 178 (CA6 2009); <em>Westberry</em> v. <em>Gislaved Gummi AB</em>, 178 F.\xc2\xa03d 257, 263\xe2\x80\x93264 (CA4 1999) (citing cases); <em>Wells</em> v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.</em>, 788 F.\xc2\xa02d 741, 744\xe2\x80\x93745 (CA11 1986).  We need not consider whether the expert testimony was properly admitted in those cases, and we do not attempt to define here what constitutes reliable evidence of causation.  It suffices to note that, as these courts have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cmedical professionals and researchers do not limit the data they consider to the results of randomized clinical trials or to statistically significant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Medical Researchers as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 31.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDA similarly does not limit the evidence it considers for purposes of assessing causation and taking regulatory action to statistically significant data.  In assessing the safety risk posed by a product, the FDA considers factors such as \xe2\x80\x9cstrength of the association,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal relationship of product use and the event,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsistency of findings across available data sources,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of a dose-response for the effect,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbiologic plausibility,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseriousness of the event relative to the disease being treated,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpotential to mitigate the risk in the population,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfeasibility of further study using observational or controlled clinical study designs,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of benefit the product provides, including availability of other therapies.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]   FDA, Guidance for Industry: Good Pharmacovigilance Prac-\ntices and Pharmacoepidemiologic Assessment 18 (2005)\n(capitalization omitted), http://www.fda.gov/downloads/\nRegulatingInformation/Guidances/UCM126834.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 17, 2011, and available in\nClerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (same); FDA, The Clinical Im-\npact of Adverse Event Reporting 6 (1996) (similar), http://www.fda.gov/downloads/safety/MedWatch/UCM168505.pdf.

For example, the FDA requires manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs to revise their labeling \xe2\x80\x9cto include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been proved.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.80(e).  More generally, the FDA may make regulatory decisions against drugs based on postmarketing evidence that gives rise to only a suspicion of causation.  See FDA, The Clinical Impact of Adverse Event Reporting, <em>supra</em>, at 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]chieving certain proof of causality through postmarketing surveillance is unusual.  Attaining a prominent degree of suspicion is much more likely, and may be considered a sufficient basis for regulatory decisions\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case proves the point.  In 2009, the FDA issued a warning letter to Matrixx stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] significant and growing body of evidence substantiates that the Zicam Cold Remedy intranasal products may pose a serious risk to consumers who use them.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 270a.  The letter cited as evidence 130 reports of anosmia the FDA had received, the fact that the FDA had received few reports of anosmia associated with other intranasal cold remedies, and \xe2\x80\x9cevidence in the published scientific literature that various salts of zinc can damage olfactory function in animals and humans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It did not cite statistically significant data.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that medical professionals and regulators act on the basis of evidence of causation that is not statistically significant, it stands to reason that in certain cases reasonable investors would as well.  As Matrixx acknowledges, adverse event reports \xe2\x80\x9cappear in many forms, including direct complaints by users to manufacturers, reports by doctors about reported or observed patient reactions, more detailed case reports published by doctors in medical journals, or larger scale published clinical studies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 17.  As a result, assessing the materiality of adverse event reports is a \xe2\x80\x9cfact-specific\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 236, that requires consideration of the source, content, and context of the reports.  This is not to say that statistical significance (or the lack thereof) is irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94only that it is not dispositive of every case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d standard does not mean that pharmaceutical manufacturers must dis-\nclose all reports of adverse events.  Adverse event reports are daily events in the pharmaceutical industry; in\n2009, the FDA entered nearly 500,000 such reports into\nits reporting system, see FDA, Reports Received and Reports Entered in AERS by Year (as of Mar. 31, 2010), http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation\xc2\xa0/Surveillance/\xc2\xa0AdverseDrugEffects/\xc2\xa0ucm070434.\nhtm.  The fact that a user of a drug has suffered an\nadverse event, standing alone, does not mean that\nthe drug caused that event.  See FDA, Annual Adverse Drug Experience Report: 1996, p.\xc2\xa02 (1997), http://drugand\ndevicelaw.net/Annual%20Adverse%20Drug%20Experience\n%20Report%201996.pdf.  The question remains whether a <em>reasonable</em> investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as having <em>significantly</em> altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 232 (quoting <em>TSC Industries</em>, 426 U. S., at 449; emphasis added).  For the reasons just stated, the mere existence of reports of adverse events\xe2\x80\x94which says nothing in and of itself about whether the drug is causing the adverse events\xe2\x80\x94will not satisfy this standard.  Something more is needed, but that something more is not limited to statistical significance and can come from \xe2\x80\x9cthe source, content, and context of the reports,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>supra</em>, at 15.  This contextual inquiry may reveal in some cases that reasonable investors would have viewed reports of adverse events as material even though the reports did not provide statistically significant evidence of a causal link.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, it bears emphasis that \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.  Disclosure is required under these provisions only when necessary \xe2\x80\x9cto make . . . statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935(b); see also <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 239, n.\xc2\xa017 (\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, absent a duty to disclose, is not misleading under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even with respect to information that a reasonable investor might consider material, companies can control what they have to disclose under these provisions by controlling what they say to the market.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying <em>Basic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d standard in this case, we conclude that respondents have adequately pleaded materiality.  This is not a case about a handful of anecdotal reports, as Matrixx suggests.  Assuming the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to be true, as we must, Matrixx received information that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between Zicam and anosmia.  That information included reports from three medical professionals and researchers about more than 10 patients who had lost their sense of smell after using Zicam.  Clarot told Linschoten that Matrixx had received additional reports of anosmia.  (In addition, during the class period, nine plaintiffs commenced four product liability lawsuits against Matrixx alleging a causal link between Zicam use and anosmia.)[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Further, Matrixx knew that Linschoten and Dr. Jafek had presented their findings about a causal link between Zicam and anosmia to a national medical conference devoted to treatment of diseases of the nose.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Their presentation described a patient who experienced severe burning in his nose, followed immediately by a loss of smell, after using Zicam\xe2\x80\x94suggesting a temporal relationship between Zicam use and anosmia.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Critically, both Dr. Hirsch and Linschoten had also drawn Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s attention to previous studies that had demonstrated a biological causal link between intranasal application of zinc and anosmia.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Before his conversation with Linschoten, Clarot, Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of research and development, was seemingly unaware of these studies, and the complaint suggests that, as of the class period, Matrixx had not conducted any research of its own relating to anosmia.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 84a (referencing a press report, issued after the end of the class period, noting that Matrixx said it would begin conducting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98animal and human studies to further characterize these post-marketing complaints\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, it can reasonably be inferred from the complaint that Matrixx had no basis for rejecting Dr. Jafek\xe2\x80\x99s findings out of hand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that these allegations suffice to \xe2\x80\x9craise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\xe2\x80\x9d satisfying the materiality requirement, <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html"></a><a href="/us/550/544/index.html">550 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  The information provided to Matrixx by medical experts revealed a plausible causal relationship between Zicam Cold Remedy and anosmia.  Consumers likely would have viewed the risk associated with Zicam (possible loss of smell) as substantially outweighing the benefit of using the product (alleviating cold symptoms), particularly in light of the existence of many alternative products on the market.  Importantly, Zicam Cold Remedy allegedly accounted for 70 percent of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s sales.  Viewing the allegations of the complaint as a whole, the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s leading product.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as having significantly altered the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal mix\xe2\x80\x9d of information made available.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Basic</em>, 485 U. S., at 232 (quoting <em>TSC Industries</em>, 426 U. S., at 449).  Matrixx told the market that revenues were going to rise 50 and then 80 percent.  Assuming the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations to be true, however, Matrixx had information indicating a significant risk to its leading revenue-generating product.  Matrixx also stated that reports indicating that Zicam caused anosmia were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98completely unfounded and misleading\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 77a\xe2\x80\x9378a.  Importantly, however, Matrixx had evidence of a biological link between Zicam\xe2\x80\x99s key ingredient and anosmia, and it had not conducted any studies of its own to disprove that link.  In fact, as Matrixx later revealed, the scientific evidence at that time was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98insufficient . . . to determine if zinc gluconate, when used as recommended, affects a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to smell.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 82a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming the facts to be true, these were material facts \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935(b).

Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s proposed bright-line rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish a strong inference of scienter is just as flawed as its approach to materiality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The inference that Matrixx acted recklessly (or intentionally, for that matter) is at least as compelling, if not more compelling, than the inference that it simply thought the reports did not indicate anything meaningful about adverse reactions.  According to the complaint, Matrixx was sufficiently concerned about the information it received that it informed Linschoten that it had hired a consultant to review the product, asked Linschoten to participate in animal studies, and convened a panel of physicians and scientists in response to Dr. Jafek\xe2\x80\x99s presentation.  It successfully prevented Dr. Jafek from using Zicam\xe2\x80\x99s name in his presentation on the ground that he needed Matrixx\xe2\x80\x99s permission to do so.  Most significantly, Matrixx issued a press release that suggested that studies had confirmed that Zicam does not cause anosmia when, in fact, it had not conducted any studies relating to anosmia and the scientific evidence at that time, according to the panel of scientists, was insufficient to determine whether Zicam did or did not cause anosmia.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These allegations, \xe2\x80\x9ctaken collectively,\xe2\x80\x9d give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9ccogent and compelling\xe2\x80\x9d inference that Matrixx elected not to disclose the reports of adverse events not because it believed they were meaningless but because it understood their likely effect on the market.  <em>Tellabs</em>, 551 U.
