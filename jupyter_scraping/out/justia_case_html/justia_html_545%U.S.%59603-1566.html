In 1993, Westlands and other water districts sued the Bureau for reducing their water supply.  Petitioners, though not parties to the 1963 contract, intervened as plaintiffs.  After negotiations, all parties except petitioners stipulated to dismissal of the districts\xe2\x80\x99 complaint.  Petitioners pressed forward with, as relevant here, the claim that the United States had breached the contract.  They contended that they were third-party beneficiaries entitled to enforce the contract and that the United States had waived its sovereign immunity from breach of contract suits in a provision of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390uu.  The District Court ultimately held that petitioners were neither contracting parties nor intended third-party beneficiaries of the contract and therefore could not benefit from \xc2\xa7390uu\xe2\x80\x99s waiver.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:\xc2\xa0Section 390uu does not waive the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  The provision grants consent \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>join</em> the United States <em>as a necessary party defendant</em> in any suit to adjudicate\xe2\x80\x9d certain rights under a federal reclamation contract.  (Emphasis added.)  A waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Department of Army</em> v. <em>Blue Fox, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/255/index.html">525 U. S. 255</a>, 261.  In light of this principle, \xc2\xa7390uu is best interpreted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties when the action requires construction of a reclamation contract and joinder of the United States is necessary.  It does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation draws support from \xc2\xa7390uu\xe2\x80\x99s use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary party,\xe2\x80\x9d a term of art whose meaning calls to mind Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for joinder of parties.  The interpretation also draws support from the contrast between \xc2\xa7390uu\xe2\x80\x99s language, which speaks in terms of joinder, and the broader phrasing of other statutes, <em>e.g.,</em> the Tucker Act, that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit, brought solely against the United States and its agents, is not an attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cjoin the United States as a necessary party defendant\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7390uu.

Westlands receives its water from the United States Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) under a 1963 contract between Westlands and the Bureau.  Petitioners contend that the Bureau breached the contract in 1993 when it reduced the water supply to Westlands.  Although petitioners are not parties to the contract, they claim that they are entitled to enforce it as intended third-party beneficiaries; that the United States waived its sovereign immunity from suits for breach of contract in a provision of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, \xc2\xa7221, 96 Stat. 1271, 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390uu; and hence that they may sue the United States in federal district court for breach of the 1963 contract.  We conclude that, in enacting \xc2\xa7390uu, Congress did not consent to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Reclamation Act of 1902 set in motion a massive program to provide federal financing, construction, and operation of water storage and distribution projects to reclaim arid lands in many Western States.  <em>California</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/645/index.html">438 U. S. 645</a>, 650 (1978).  The California Central Valley Project (CVP), a system of dams, reservoirs, levees, canals, pumping stations, hydropower plants, and other infrastructure, distributes water throughout California\xe2\x80\x99s vast Central Valley.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gerlach Live Stock Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/725/index.html">339 U. S. 725</a>, 733 (1950).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bureau, located in the Department of the Interior, administers the CVP.  In accordance with its standard practice for federal reclamation projects, the Bureau holds permits to appropriate water from the relevant state agency, here the California State Water Resources Control Board.  See <em>California, supra, </em>at 652, and n. 7.  The Bureau distributes the water in accordance with its statutory and contractual obligations.  It contracts with state irrigation districts to deliver water and to receive reimbursement for the costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining the works.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1963, the United States agreed to a 40-year water service contract with Westlands, a political subdivision of the State of California.  The 1963 contract provided, among other things, that the United States would furnish to the District specified annual quantities of water, App. 34\xe2\x80\x9336, and that the District would accept and pay for the water at a maximum rate of $8 per acre-foot, <em>id.,</em> at 38.  Since 1978, the contract has generated extensive litigation.  See <em>Barcellos &amp; Wolfsen, Inc.</em> v. <em>Westlands Water Dist.</em>, 899 F.\xc2\xa02d 814, 817 (CA9 1990); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neill</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 50 F.\xc2\xa03d 677, 681 (CA9 1995); 358 F.\xc2\xa03d 1137, 1141 (CA9 2004) (case below).  In 1982, Congress enacted the Reclamation Reform Act, which included 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390uu, the waiver of sovereign immunity at issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case arose from water delivery reductions in the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.  Those reductions stemmed from environmental obligations imposed on the Bureau by the 1992 enactment of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), 106 Stat. 4706.  The CVPIA directed the Secretary of the Interior to \xe2\x80\x9coperate the [CVP] to meet all obligations under \xe2\x80\xa6 the Federal Endangered Species Act\xe2\x80\x9d (ESA), \xc2\xa73406(b), and to dedicate annually a certain amount of CVP water to implement fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration, \xc2\xa73406(b)(2).  In the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon as a threatened species under the ESA, see 55 Fed. Reg. 46523 (1990); 50 CFR \xc2\xa7227.4(e) (1991); and, in 1993, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the delta smelt as a threatened species, see 58 Fed. Reg. 12854\xe2\x80\x9312855; 50 CFR \xc2\xa717.11.  The Bureau concluded that pumps used to deliver water south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta could harm these species.  Brief for United States 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa07.  To avert possible harm to these species and other wildlife, the Bureau concluded that it needed to reduce the water delivery.  In the 1993\xe2\x80\x931994 water year, the Bureau reduced by 50 percent the contractual delivery of CVP water to water districts south of the Delta, including Westlands.  <em>Id.,</em> at 10; see also <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, supra,</em> at 681.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1993, Westlands and several other water districts challenged the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s 50-percent delivery reduction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and the Due Process and Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.  <em>Westlands Water Dist. </em>v. <em>United\xc2\xa0States Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</em>, 850 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1388, 1394\xe2\x80\x931395 (ED Cal. 1994).  Petitioner landowners and water users intervened as plaintiffs.  Respondent Natural Resources Defense Council and other fishing and conservation organizations intervened as defendants.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1394.  Ultimately, following negotiations among the State of California, the Federal Government, and urban, agricultural, and environmental interests, the water districts and all parties except petitioners stipulated to the dismissal of the districts\xe2\x80\x99 complaint.  358 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1142; App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a; Brief for United States 11.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners pressed forward with numerous claims.  The District Court dismissed some of them and granted summary judgment for the Government on others, see 358 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1142, leaving only the claim at issue here: that the United States had breached the 1963 contract by reducing the delivery of water and was liable for money damages.  Petitioners contended that the United States had waived its sovereign immunity from their suit in the Reclamation Reform Act, 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390uu.  The District Court initially held that petitioners were intended third-party beneficiaries and that the language of \xc2\xa7390uu was broad enough to allow their suit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, but on reconsideration changed its view.  It held that, in light of intervening circuit authority, <em>Klamath Water Users Protective Assn.</em> v. <em>Patterson</em>, 204 F.\xc2\xa03d 1206 (CA9 1999), petitioners were neither contracting parties nor intended third-party beneficiaries of the 1963 contract, and therefore could not benefit from \xc2\xa7390uu\xe2\x80\x99s waiver.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a\xe2\x80\x9334a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part.  It agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the 1963 contract and \xc2\xa7390uu in light of <em>Klamath</em>.  358 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1144\xe2\x80\x931147.  The Court of Appeals noted that its decision might be at odds with <em>H. F. Allen Orchards</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 749 F.\xc2\xa02d 1571 (CA Fed. 1984), which had reached the opposite conclusion with respect to farmers who belonged to an irrigation district in Washington.  358 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1147, n.\xc2\xa05.  We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. __ (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This dispute centers on \xc2\xa7390uu, which waives the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity for certain purposes.  Section 390uu provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cConsent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity and the United States regarding any contract executed pursuant to Federal reclamation law.  The United States, when a party to any suit, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.  Any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend that they are intended third-party beneficiaries of the 1963 contract and therefore entitled to enforce the contract.  Hence, they claim, their suit is one \xe2\x80\x9cto adjudicate . . . the contractual rights of a contracting entity and the United States\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7390uu.  This argument founders on the principle that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Department of Army</em> v. <em>Blue Fox, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/255/index.html">525 U. S. 255</a>, 261 (1999); <em>Lane</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/187/index.html">518 U. S. 187</a>, 192 (1996).  Construing \xc2\xa7390uu in light of this principle, we find it insufficient to waive sovereign\nimmunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 390uu grants consent \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>join</em> the United States <em>as a necessary party defendant </em>in any suit to adjudicate\xe2\x80\x9d certain rights under a federal reclamation contract.  (Emphasis added.)  This language is best interpreted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties\xe2\x80\x94for example, two water districts, or a water district and its members\xe2\x80\x94when the action requires construction of a reclamation contract and joinder of the United States is necessary.  It does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 390uu\xe2\x80\x99s use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary party\xe2\x80\x9d supports this interpretation.  Before 1966, the term \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d described the class of parties now called \xe2\x80\x9cPersons to be Joined if Feasible\xe2\x80\x9d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a).  See <em>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em> v. <em>Patterson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/102/index.html">390 U. S. 102</a>, 116\xe2\x80\x93118, and n. 12 (1968) (recounting terminology change).  Rule 19(a) requires a court to order joinder of a party if </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) in the person\xe2\x80\x99s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person\xe2\x80\x99s absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThough the Rule no longer describes such parties as \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary party\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art whose meaning parallels Rule 19(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary parties\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthose persons who must be joined in an action because, <em>inter alia,</em> complete relief cannot be given to those already parties without their joinder,\xe2\x80\x9d and citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa019(a)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cjoin . . . as a necessary party defendant\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7390uu thus calls to mind Rule 19(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  We need not decide here whether the phrase limits the waiver of sovereign immunity to cases in which the United States could be joined under Rule 19(a).  Regardless, the traditional concept of joinder of a necessary party supports interpreting \xc2\xa7390uu to permit joinder of the United States in an action rather than initiation of a suit solely against it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion draws force from the contrast between \xc2\xa7390uu\xe2\x80\x99s language, which speaks in terms of joinder, and the broader phrasing of statutes that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone.  For example, the Tucker Act grants the United States Court of Federal Claims \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71491(a)(1).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Little Tucker Act grants district courts original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims, over \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny . . . civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded \xe2\x80\xa6 upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71346(a)(2).  The contrast between 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390uu and the broader language of these statutes confirms that our construction ascribes the proper meaning to the limiting phrase \xe2\x80\x9cjoin . . . as a necessary party defendant\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7390uu.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit cannot proceed under our interpretation of \xc2\xa7390uu.  For purposes of that provision, petitioners sought to sue the United States alone: They named as defendants the United States itself, as well as various federal entities and officials they viewed as responsible for the water delivery reduction (for example, the Bureau, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Secretary of the Interior).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit, brought solely against the United States and its agents, is not an attempt to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>join</em> the United States as a necessary party defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7390uu (emphasis added).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that \xc2\xa7390uu does not waive immunity from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 suit: The statute does not waive immunity from suits directly against the United States, as opposed to joinder of the United States as a necessary party defendant to permit a complete adjudication of rights under a reclamation contract.
