After her job as an elevator operator was eliminated, respondent Thomas applied for disability insurance benefits and SSI.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that her impairments did not prevent her from performing her past relevant work as an elevator operator, rejecting her argument that she is unable to do that work because it no longer exists in significant numbers in the national economy.  The District Court affirmed the ALJ, concluding that whether Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s old job exists is irrelevant under the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (SSA) regulations.  In reversing and remanding, the en banc Third Circuit held that \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) unambiguously provides that the ability to perform prior work disqualifies from benefits only if it is substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s determination that it can find a claimant not disabled where she remains physically and mentally able to do her previous work, without investigating whether that work exists in significant numbers in the national economy, is a reasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) that is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>.  Section 423(d)(2)(A) establishes two requirements: An impairment must render an individual \xe2\x80\x9cunable to do his previous work\xe2\x80\x9d and must also preclude him from \xe2\x80\x9cengag[ing] in any other kind of substantial gainful work.\xe2\x80\x9d  The clause \xe2\x80\x9cwhich exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d clearly qualifies the latter requirement.  The issue in this case is whether that clause also qualifies the former requirement.  The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations, which create a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine disability, answer that question in the negative.  At step four, the SSA will find not disabled a claimant who can do his previous work, without inquiring whether that work exists in the national economy.  Rather, it reserves inquiry into the national economy for the fifth step, when it considers vocational factors and determines whether the claimant can perform other jobs in the national economy.  See 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1520(f), 404.1560(c), 416.920(f), 416.960(c).  That interpretation is a reasonable construction of \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A).  The Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading ignores the grammatical \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x9d under which a limiting clause or phrase should be read to modify only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.  Construing \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) in accord with this rule is quite sensible.  Congress could have determined that an analysis of a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to do his previous work would in most cases be an effective and efficient administrative proxy for the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do <em>some</em> work that exists in the national economy.  There is good reason to use such a proxy to avoid the more expansive and individualized step-five analysis.  The proper <em>Chevron</em> inquiry is not whether an agency construction can give rise to undesirable results in some instances (which both the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s and the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s constructions can), but whether, in light of the alternatives, the agency construction is reasonable.  Here, the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative interpretation satisfies that test.

In June 1996, at age 53, Thomas applied for disability insurance benefits under Title II and Supplemental Security Income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.  See 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7401 <em>et seq.</em> (Title II); as added, 86 Stat. 1465, and as amended, \xc2\xa71381 <em>et seq.</em> (Title XVI).  She claimed that she suffered from, and was\ndisabled by, heart disease and cervical and lumbar\nradiculopathy.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the SSA denied Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s application initially and on reconsideration, she requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  The ALJ found that Thomas had \xe2\x80\x9chypertension, cardiac arrythmia, [and] cervical and lumbar strain/sprain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Decision of ALJ 5, Record 15.  He concluded, however, that Thomas was not under a \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d because her \xe2\x80\x9cimpairments do not prevent [her] from performing her past relevant work as an elevator operator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 6, Record 16.  He rejected Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s argument that she is unable to do her previous work because that work no longer exists in significant numbers in the national economy.  The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s Appeals Council denied Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s request for review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thomas then challenged the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, renewing her argument that she is unable to do her previous work due to its scarcity.  The District Court affirmed the ALJ, concluding that whether Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s old job exists is irrelevant under the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Apfel</em>, Civ. No. 99\xe2\x80\x932234 (Aug. 17, 2000).  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed and remanded.  Over the dissent of three of its members, it held that the statute unambiguously provides that the ability to perform prior work disqualifies from benefits only if it is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  294 F.\xc2\xa03d 568, 572 (2002).  That holding conflicts with the decisions of four other Courts of Appeals.  See <em>Quang Van Han</em> v. <em>Bowen</em>, 882 F.\xc2\xa02d 1453, 1457 (CA9 1989); <em>Garcia</em> v. <em>Secretary of Health and Human Services</em>, 46 F.\xc2\xa03d 552, 558 (CA6 1995); <em>Pass</em> v. <em>Chater</em>, 65 F.\xc2\xa03d 1200, 1206\xe2\x80\x931207 (CA4 1995); <em>Rater</em> v. <em>Chater</em>, 73 F.\xc2\xa03d 796, 799 (CA8 1996).  We granted the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/1187/index.html">537 U. S. 1187</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant to the present case, Title II of the Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7423(d)(1)(A).  That definition is qualified, however, as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that <em>he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot</em>, considering his age, education, and work experience, <em>engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy</em>\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9c[W]ork which exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to mean \xe2\x80\x9cwork which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Title XVI of the Act, which governs Supplemental Security Income benefits for disabled indigent persons, employs the same definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdisability\xe2\x80\x9d used in Title II, including a qualification that is <em>verbatim</em> the same as \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A).  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71382c(a)(3)(B).  For simplicity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, we will refer only to the Title II provisions, but our analysis applies equally to Title XVI.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 423(d)(2)(A) establishes two requirements for disability.  First, an individual\xe2\x80\x99s physical or mental impairment must render him \xe2\x80\x9cunable to do his previous work.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, the impairment must also preclude him from \xe2\x80\x9cengag[ing] in any other kind of substantial gainful work.\xe2\x80\x9d  The parties agree that the <em>latter</em> requirement is qualified by the clause that immediately follows it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhich exists in the national economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  The issue in this case is whether that clause also qualifies \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SSA has answered this question in the negative.  Acting pursuant to its statutory rulemaking authority, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7405(a) (Title II), 1383(d)(1) (Title XVI), the agency has promulgated regulations establishing a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine disability.  See 20 CFR \xc2\xa7404.1520 (2003) (governing claims for disability insurance benefits); \xc2\xa7416.920 (parallel regulation governing claims for Supplemental Security Income).  If at any step a finding of disability or non-disability can be made, the SSA will not review the claim further.  At the first step, the agency will find non-disability unless the claimant shows that he is not working at a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial gainful activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1520(b), 416.920(b).  At step two, the SSA will find non-disability unless the claimant shows that he has a \xe2\x80\x9csevere impairment,\xe2\x80\x9d defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limits [the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1520(c), 416.920(c).  At step three, the agency determines whether the impairment which enabled the claimant to survive step two is on the list of impairments presumed severe enough to render one disabled; if so, the claimant qualifies.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1520(d), 416.920(d).  If the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s impairment is not on the list, the inquiry proceeds to step four, at which the SSA assesses whether the claimant can do his previous work; unless he shows that he cannot, he is determined not to be disabled.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  If the claimant survives the fourth stage, the fifth, and final, step requires the SSA to consider so-called \xe2\x80\x9cvocational factors\xe2\x80\x9d (the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s age, education, and past work experience), and to determine whether the claimant is capable of performing other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1520(f), 404.1560(c), 416.920(f), 416.960(c).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the above description shows, step four can result in a determination of no disability without inquiry into whether the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s previous work exists in the national economy; the regulations explicitly reserve inquiry into the national economy for step five.  Thus, the SSA has made it perfectly clear that it does not interpret the clause \xe2\x80\x9cwhich exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) as applying to \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The issue presented is whether this agency interpretation must be accorded deference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we held in <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984), when a statute speaks clearly to the issue at hand we \xe2\x80\x9cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d but when the statute \xe2\x80\x9cis silent or ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d we must defer to a reasonable construction by the agency charged with its implementation.  The Third Circuit held that, by referring first to \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work\xe2\x80\x9d and then to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any other</em> kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) (emphasis added), the statute unambiguously indicates that the former is a species of the latter.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence sets out one or more specific items followed by \xe2\x80\x98any other\xe2\x80\x99 and a description, the specific items must fall within the description.\xe2\x80\x9d  294 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 572.  We disagree.  For the reasons discussed below the interpretation adopted by SSA is at least a reasonable construction of the text and must therefore be given effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reading disregards\xe2\x80\x94indeed, is precisely contrary to\xe2\x80\x94the grammatical \xe2\x80\x9crule of the last antecedent,\xe2\x80\x9d according to which a limiting clause or phrase (here, the relative clause \xe2\x80\x9cwhich exists in the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d) should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows (here, \xe2\x80\x9cany other kind of substantial gainful work\xe2\x80\x9d).  See 2A N. Singer, Sutherland<em> </em>on<em> </em>Statutory<em> </em>Construction \xc2\xa747.33, p.\xc2\xa0369 (6th rev. ed. 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cReferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent\xe2\x80\x9d).  While this rule is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning, we have said that construing a statute in accord with the rule is \xe2\x80\x9cquite sensible as a matter of grammar.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nobelman</em> v. <em>American Savings Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/324/index.html">508 U.

S. 385</a> (1959), this Court employed the rule to interpret a statute strikingly similar in structure to \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x94a provision of the Fur Products Labeling Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa769, which defined \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98invoice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a written account, memorandum, list, or catalog \xe2\x80\xa6 transported or delivered to a purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent, or agent, <em>or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  359 U. S., at 386 (quoting 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa769(f)) (emphasis added).  Like the Third Circuit here, the Court of Appeals in <em>Mandel Brothers</em> had interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any other\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as rendering the relative clause (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98who is engaged in dealing commercially\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) applicable to all the specifically listed categories.  359 U. S., at 389.  This Court unanimously reversed, concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9climiting clause is to be applied only to the last antecedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 389, and n.\xc2\xa04 (citing 2 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction \xc2\xa74921 (3d ed. 1943)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An example will illustrate the error of the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s perception that the specifically enumerated \xe2\x80\x9cprevious work\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d be treated the same as the more general reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany other kind of substantial gainful work.\xe2\x80\x9d  294 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 572.  Consider, for example, the case of parents who, before leaving their teenage son alone in the house for the weekend, warn him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be punished if you throw a party or engage in any other activity that damages the house.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the son nevertheless throws a party and is caught, he should hardly be able to avoid punishment by arguing that the house was not damaged.  The parents proscribed (1) a party, and (2) any other activity that damages the house.  As far as appears from what they said, their reasons for prohibiting the home-alone party may have had nothing to do with damage to the house\xe2\x80\x94for instance, the risk that underage drinking or sexual activity would occur.  And even if their only concern was to prevent damage, it does not follow from the fact that the same interest underlay both the specific and the general prohibition that proof of impairment of that interest is required for both.  The parents, foreseeing that assessment of whether an activity had in fact \xe2\x80\x9cdamaged\xe2\x80\x9d the house could be disputed by their son, might have wished to preclude all argument by specifying and categorically prohibiting the one activity\xe2\x80\x94hosting a party\xe2\x80\x94that was most likely to cause damage and most likely to occur.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit suggested that interpreting the statute as does the SSA would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>See also <em>Kolman</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, 925 F.\xc2\xa02d 212, 213 (CA7 1991) (the fact that a claimant could perform a past job that no longer exists would not be \xe2\x80\x9ca rational ground for denying benefits\xe2\x80\x9d).  The court could conceive of \xe2\x80\x9cno plausible reason why Congress might have wanted to deny benefits to an otherwise qualified person simply because that person, although unable to perform any job that actually exists in the national economy, could perform a previous job that no longer exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  294 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  But on the very next page the Third Circuit conceived of <em>just </em>such a plausible reason, namely, that \xe2\x80\x9cin the vast majority of cases, a claimant who is found to have the capacity to perform her past work also will have the capacity to perform other types of work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 574, n.\xc2\xa05.  The conclusion which follows is that Congress could have determined that an analysis of a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s physical and mental capacity to do his previous work would \xe2\x80\x9cin the vast majority of cases\xe2\x80\x9d serve as an effective and efficient administrative proxy for the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do <em>some</em> work that does exist in the national economy.  Such a proxy is useful because the step-five inquiry into whether the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s cumulative impairments preclude him from finding \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d work is very difficult, requiring consideration of \xe2\x80\x9ceach of th[e] [vocational] factors and \xe2\x80\xa6 an individual assessment of each claimant\xe2\x80\x99s abilities and limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Campbell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/458/index.html">461 U.

There is good reason to use a workable proxy that avoids the more expansive and individualized step-five analysis.  As we have observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Social Security hearing system is \xe2\x80\x98probably the largest adjudicative agency in the western world.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 The need for efficiency is self-evident.\xe2\x80\x9d  461 U. S.<em>,</em> at 461, n.\xc2\xa02 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit rejected this proxy rationale because it would produce results that \xe2\x80\x9cmay not always be true, and \xe2\x80\xa6 may not be true in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  294 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 576.  That logic would invalidate a vast number of the procedures employed by the administrative state.  To generalize is to be imprecise.  Virtually <em>every</em> legal (or other) rule has imperfect applications in particular circumstances.  Cf. <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Yuckert,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/137/index.html">482 U. S. 137</a>, 157 (1987) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure the Secretary faces an administrative task of staggering proportions in applying the disability benefits provisions of the Social Security Act.  Perfection in processing millions of such claims annually is impossible\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is true that, under the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, a worker with severely limited capacity who has managed to find easy work in a declining industry could be penalized for his troubles if the job later disappears.  It is also true, however, that under the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, impaired workers in declining or marginal industries who cannot do \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d work could simply refuse to return to their jobs\xe2\x80\x94even though the jobs remain open and available\xe2\x80\x94and nonetheless draw disability benefits.  The proper <em>Chevron</em> inquiry is not whether the agency construction can give rise to undesirable results in some instances (as here <em>both</em> constructions can), but rather whether, in light of the alternatives, the agency construction is reasonable.  In the present case, the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative interpretation certainly satisfies that test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have considered respondent\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide today whether \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) compels the interpretation given it by the SSA.  It suffices to conclude, as we do, that \xc2\xa7423(d)(2)(A) does not unambiguously require a different interpretation, and that the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is an entirely reasonable interpretation of the text.
