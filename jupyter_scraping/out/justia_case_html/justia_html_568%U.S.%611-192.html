Bormes is an attorney who filed a putative class action against the United States in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking damages under FCRA.  Bormes alleged that he paid a $350 federal-court filing fee for a client using his own credit card on Pay.gov, an Internet-based system used by federal courts and dozens of federal agencies to process online payment transactions.  According to Bormes, his Pay.gov electronic receipt included the last four digits of his credit card, in addition to its expiration date, in willful violation of \xc2\xa71681c(g)(1).  He claimed that he and thousands of similarly situated persons were entitled to recover damages under \xc2\xa71681n, and asserted jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71681p, as well as under the Little Tucker Act, \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(a)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court dismissed the suit, holding that FCRA does not contain the explicit waiver of sovereign immunity necessary to permit a damages suit against the United States.  638 F. Supp. 2d 958, 962 (ND Ill. 2009).  The court did not address the Little Tucker Act as an asserted basis for jurisdiction.  Respondent appealed to the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cof an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on\xe2\x80\x9d the Little Tucker Act.  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71295(a)(2).

Without deciding whether FCRA itself contained the requisite waiver of sovereign immunity, the court held that the Little Tucker Act provided the Government\xe2\x80\x99s consent to suit for violation of FCRA.  The court explained that the Little Tucker Act applied because FCRA \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  626 F. 3d 574, 578 (2010) (quoting United States v.

This \xe2\x80\x9cfair interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d rule, the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cdemands a showing \xe2\x80\x98demonstrably lower\xe2\x80\x99 than the initial waiver of sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x9d contained in the Little Tucker Act itself.  626 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 578.  The court reasoned that FCRA satisfied the \xe2\x80\x9cfair interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d rule because its damages provision applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d who willfully violates its requirements, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681n(a), and the Act elsewhere defines \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71681a(b).  626 F. 3d, at 580.

Before the creation of the Court of Claims in 1855, see Act of Feb. 24, 1855 (1855 Act), ch. 122, \xc2\xa71, \n\n10Stat.\n612, it was not uncommon for statutes to impose monetary obligations on the United States without specifying a means of judicial enforcement.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  As a result, claimants routinely petitioned Congress for private bills to recover money owed by the Federal Government.  See Mitchell II, supra, at 212 (citing P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 98 (2d ed. 1973)).  As this individualized legislative process became increasingly burdensome for Congress, the Court of Claims was created \xe2\x80\x9cto relieve the pressure on Congress caused by the volume of private bills.\xe2\x80\x9d  Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, \n\n370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530, \n552 (1962)\n (plurality opinion).

(Specialized legislation remained necessary to authorize the payments approved by the Court of Claims until 1863, when Congress empowered the court to enter final judgments.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1863 (1863 Act), ch. 92, \n\n12Stat.\n765; Mitchell II, supra, at 212\xe2\x80\x93214 (recounting the history of the Court of Claims)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEnacted in 1887, the Tucker Act was the successor statute to the 1855 and 1863 Acts and replaced most of their provisions.

Section 2 of the 1887 Act created concurrent jurisdiction in the district courts for claims of up to $1,000.  The Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant, and accompanying immunity waiver, supplied the missing ingredient for an action against the United States for the breach of monetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Tucker Act is displaced, however, when a law assertedly imposing monetary liability on the United States contains its own judicial remedies.

In Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, 131 (1869), the issue was whether the 1855 Act authorized suit in the Court of Claims for improper assessment of duties on imported liquor that had already been paid without protest.  The Court held that it did not.  The revenue laws already provided a remedy: An aggrieved merchant could sue to recover the tax, but only after paying the duty under protest.  Act of Feb. 26, 1845, ch.\xc2\xa022, \n\n5Stat.\n727.  The Court rejected the supposition that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress, after having carefully constructed a revenue system, with ample provisions to redress wrong, intended to give to the taxpayer and importer a further and different remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Wall., at 131.  Permitting suit under the 1855 Act, the Court concluded, would frustrate congressional intent with respect to the specific remedial scheme already in place.  The 1855 Act was confined to a gap-filling role.  As we said in a later case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe general laws which govern the Court of Claims may be resorted to for relief\xe2\x80\x9d only because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o special remedy has been provided\xe2\x80\x9d to enforce a payment to which the claimant was entitled.  United States v. Kaufman, \n\n96 U.\xc2\xa0S. 567, \n569 (1878)\n.  Where the \xe2\x80\x9cliability is one created by statute,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial remedy provided by the same statute is exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur more recent cases have consistently held that statutory schemes with their own remedial framework exclude alternative relief under the general terms of the Tucker Act.  See, e.g., Hinck, supra; United States v. Fausto, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 439 (1988)\n; United States v. Erika, Inc., \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 201 (1982)\n.  Respondent contends that in each of those cases Congress had unambiguously demonstrated its intent to foreclose additional review by the Court of Federal Claims\xe2\x80\x94whereas here, no similar intent to preclude Tucker Act jurisdiction is apparent.  See Brief for Respondent 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But our precedents collectively stand for a more basic proposition: Where a specific statutory scheme provides the accoutrements of a judicial action, the metes and bounds of the liability Congress intended to create can only be divined from the text of the statute itself.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Hinck, for example, we held that the Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for suits under \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76404(h), which authorizes judicial review of the Secre-tary\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to abate interest under \xc2\xa76404(e)(1).  We relied on \xe2\x80\x9cour past recognition that when Congress enacts a specific remedy when no remedy was previously recognized .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the remedy provided is generally regarded as exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 506.  Section 6404(h), we concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cfits the bill\xe2\x80\x9d: it \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a forum for adjudication, a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  It did not matter that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] explicitly to define the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction as exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We found it \xe2\x80\x9cquite plain that the terms of \xc2\xa76404(h)\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98precisely drawn, detailed statute\xe2\x80\x99 filling a perceived hole in the law\xe2\x80\x94control all requests for review of \xc2\xa76404(e)(1) determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike \xc2\xa76404(h), FCRA creates a detailed remedial scheme.  Its provisions \xe2\x80\x9cset out a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific\xe2\x80\x9d cause of action, and \xe2\x80\x9calso precisely define the appropriate forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 507.  It authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold \xe2\x80\x9cany person\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d fails to comply with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements liable for specified damages.  15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71681n(a), 1681o.  Claims to enforce liability must be brought within a specified limitations period, \xc2\xa71681p, and jurisdiction will lie \xe2\x80\x9cin any appropriate United States dis- trict court, without regard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Without resort to the Tucker Act, FCRA enables claimants to pursue in court the monetary relief contemplated by the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPlaintiffs cannot, therefore, mix and match FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions with the Little Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s immunity waiver to create an action against the United States.  Since FCRA is a detailed remedial scheme, only its own text can determine whether the damages liability Congress crafted extends to the Federal Government.  To hold otherwise\xe2\x80\x94to permit plaintiffs to remedy the absence of a waiver of sovereign immunity in specific, detailed statutes by pleading general Tucker Act jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94would transform the sovereign-immunity landscape.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Federal Circuit was therefore wrong to conclude that the Tucker Act justified applying a \xe2\x80\x9cless stringent\xe2\x80\x9d sovereign-immunity analysis to FCRA than our cases require.  626 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582.  It distorted our case law in applying to FCRA the immunity-waiver standard we expressed in White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 472: whether the statute \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  626 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 578.  That is the test for determining whether a statute that imposes an obligation but does not provide the elements of a cause of action qualifies for suit under the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x94more specifically, whether the failure to perform an obligation undoubtedly imposed on the Federal Government creates a right to monetary relief.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe, supra; Mitchell II, \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 206\n.  That test is not relevant when a \xe2\x80\x9cmandate of compensation\xe2\x80\x9d is contained in a statute that provides a detailed judicial remedy against those who are subject to its requirements.  FCRA is such a statute.  By using the \xe2\x80\x9cfair interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d test to determine whether FCRA\xe2\x80\x99s civil liability provisions apply to the United States, the Federal Circuit directed the test to a purpose for which it was not designed and leapfrogged the threshold concern that the Tucker Act cannot be superimposed on an existing remedial scheme.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not decide here whether FCRA itself waives the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity to damages actions under \xc2\xa71681n.  That question is for the Seventh Circuit to consider once this case is transferred to it on remand.  But whether or not FCRA contains the necessary waiver of immunity, any attempt to append a Tucker Act remedy to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s existing remedial scheme interferes with its intended scope of liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case remanded with instructions to transfer the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that this class action satisfied the Little Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy limitation.
