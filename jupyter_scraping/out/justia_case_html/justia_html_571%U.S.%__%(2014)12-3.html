As is common in the industry, the mutual funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees.  Both plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by FMR.  Each commenced suit in federal court.  Moving to dismiss the suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under \xc2\xa71514A, for that provision protects only employees of public companies, and not employees of private companies that contract with public companies.  On interlocutory appeal from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of FMR\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the term \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71514A(a) refers only to employees of public companies.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public company\xe2\x80\x99s private contractors and subcontractors.

See Moskal v. United States,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n.  As relevant here, \xc2\xa71514A(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. contractor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may discharge .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d in this proscription is the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s own employee.  FMR\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower construction\xe2\x80\x9d requires inserting \xe2\x80\x9cof a public company\xe2\x80\x9d after \xe2\x80\x9can employee,\xe2\x80\x9d but where Congress meant \xe2\x80\x9can employee of a public company,\xe2\x80\x9d it said so.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The provision as a whole supports this reading.  The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in \xc2\xa71514A(a)\xe2\x80\x94discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x94are actions an employer takes against its own employees.  Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.  FMR\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provision\xe2\x80\x99s ban on retaliation by contractors.  The protected activity covered by \xc2\xa71514A, and the provision\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblowing employee.

It urges that \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their housekeepers or gardeners.  This concern appears more theoretical than real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments opposing FMR\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71514A.  FMR also urges that its reading is supported by the provision\xe2\x80\x99s statutory headings, but those headings are \xe2\x80\x9cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.\xe2\x80\x9d  Trainmen v.

The legislative record shows Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the employees of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s contractors.  Sarbanes-Oxley contains numerous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only \xc2\xa71514A affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers for complying with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s reporting requirements.

Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are managed, instead, by independent investment advisors.  Accordingly, the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower construction\xe2\x80\x9d endorsed by FMR would leave \xc2\xa71514A with no application to mutual funds.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71514A, in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mutual funds.

The Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s regulations have interpreted \xc2\xa71514A as protecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor has asserted a \xc2\xa71514A claim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud.  Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems.  This Court need not determine \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s bounds here, however, because, if plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the \xe2\x80\x9cfirsthand witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud\xe2\x80\x9d Congress anticipated \xc2\xa71514A would protect.

See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 107\xe2\x80\x93146, pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9311 (2002).  A provision of the Act,\n\n18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71514A, protects whistleblowers.  Section 1514A, at the time here relevant, instructed:</p>\n<p style="p-BQ Only 1 Para">\xe2\x80\x9cNo [public] company .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71514A(a) (2006 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case concerns the definition of the protected class: Does \xc2\xa71514A shield only those employed by the public company itself, or does it shield as well employees of privately held contractors and subcontractors\xe2\x80\x94for example, investment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises\xe2\x80\x94who perform work for the public company?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We hold, based on the text of \xc2\xa71514A, the mischief to which Congress was responding, and earlier legislation Congress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees of private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shelters employees of the public company served by the contractors and subcontractors.  We first summarize our principal reasons, then describe this controversy and explain our decision more comprehensively.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of private companies that contract to advise or manage mutual funds.  The mutual funds themselves are public companies that have no employees.  Hence, if the whistle is to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund investors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another company\xe2\x80\x99s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual fund\xe2\x80\x99s investment adviser or manager.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both plaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse action by their employers.  Plaintiffs read \xc2\xa71514A to convey that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. contractor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. discriminate against [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].\xe2\x80\x9d  We find that reading consistent with the text of the statute and with common sense.  Contractors are in control of their own employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control someone else\xe2\x80\x99s workers.  Moreover, we resist attributing to Congress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating against whistleblowers employed by the public company the contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to retaliate against its own employees when they reveal corporate fraud.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, contractors and subcontractors, including the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron\xe2\x80\x99s fraud and its coverup.  When employees of those contractors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encountered retaliation by their employers.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies.  See, e.g., \n\n116Stat.\n750\xe2\x80\x93765, 773\xe2\x80\x93774, 784, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x93107, 203\xe2\x80\x93206, 307.  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern about contractor conduct of the kind that contributed to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, we regard with suspicion construction of \xc2\xa71514A to protect whistleblowers only when they are employed by a public company, and not when they work for the public company\xe2\x80\x99s contractor.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress borrowed \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against retaliation from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21),\n\n49 U. S. C. \xc2\xa742121.  That Act provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNo air carrier or contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may discharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\xe2\x80\x9d when the employee provides information regarding violations \xe2\x80\x9crelating to air carrier safety\xe2\x80\x9d to his or her employer or federal authorities.  \xc2\xa742121(a)(1).  AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contractors and subcontractors of the carriers.  Given the parallel statu-tory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we readthe words \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d in AIR 21 and in \xc2\xa71514A to have similar import.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act) aims to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud, protect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of such fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

The Fidelity funds are not parties to either case; as is common in the mutual fund industry, the Fidelity funds themselves have no employees.  Instead, they contract with investment advisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day operations, which include making investment decisions, preparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Lawson was employed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidiary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.

Zang was employed by FMR for eight years, most recently as a portfolio manager for several of the funds.  He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for raising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC reg-istration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.  Lawson and Zang separately filed administrative complaints alleging retaliation proscribed by \xc2\xa71514A.  After expiration of the 180-day period specified in \xc2\xa71514A(b)(1), Lawson and Zang each filed suit in the U.\xc2\xa0S.

The majority agreed with FMR, however, that \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to employees of public companies and does not cover a contractor\xe2\x80\x99s own employees.  Id., at 68\xe2\x80\x9380.  Judge Thompson dissented.

Another anti-retaliation pro-vision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] broker or dealer and persons employed by a broker or dealer who areinvolved with investment banking activities may not, directly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to retaliate against any securities analyst employed by that broker or dealer or its affiliates .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778o\xe2\x80\x936(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  In contrast, nothing in \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s language confines the class of employees protected to those of a designated employer.  Absent any textual qualification, we presume the operative language means what it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate against its own employee for engaging in protected whistle-blowing activity.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1514A\xe2\x80\x99s application to contractor employeesis confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term\xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d to the provision as a whole.  The prohib-ited retaliatory measures enumerated in \xc2\xa71514A(a)\xe2\x80\x94discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or dis-crimination in the terms and conditions of employment\xe2\x80\x94are commonly actions an employer takes against itsown employees.  Contractors are not ordinarily posi-tioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.  FMR\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provision\xe2\x80\x99s ban on retaliation by contractors.  The dissent embraces FMR\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower\xe2\x80\x9d construction.  See post, at 2, 3, 4, 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        FMR urges that Congress included contractors in \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s list of governed actors simply to prevent public companies from avoiding liability by employing contractors to effectuate retaliatory discharges.  FMR describes such a contractor as an \xe2\x80\x9cax-wielding specialist,\xe2\x80\x9d illustrated by George Clooney\xe2\x80\x99s character in the movie Up in the Air.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Brief for Respondents 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding specialist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad news that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in deciding who to terminate.  If the company employing the ax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retaliatory reasons, the \xc2\xa71514A claim would properly be directed at the company.  Hiring the ax-wielder would not insulate the company from liability.  Moreover, we see no indication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the real-world problem that prompted Congress to add contractors to \xc2\xa71514A.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moving further through \xc2\xa71514A to the protected activity described in subsection (a)(1), we find further reason to believe that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower.  Employees gain protection for furnishing information to a federal agency, Congress, or \xe2\x80\x9ca person with supervisory authority over the employee (or such other person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate misconduct).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71514A(a)(1) (emphasis added).  And under \xc2\xa71514A(a)(2), employees are protected from retaliation for assisting \xe2\x80\x9cin a proceeding filed or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the employer) relating to an alleged violation\xe2\x80\x9d of any of the enumerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other federal law relating to shareholder fraud.  \xc2\xa71514A(a)(2) (emphasis added).  The reference to employer knowledge is an additional indicator of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expectation that the retaliator typically will be the employee\xe2\x80\x99s employer, not another entity less likely to know of whistleblower complaints filed or about to be filed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1514A\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement procedures and remedies similarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an employee of the retaliator.  As earlier noted, see supra, at 6, \xc2\xa71514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under \xc2\xa71514A \xe2\x80\x9cshall be governed under the rules and procedures set forth in section 42121(b) of title 49,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., AIR 21\xe2\x80\x99s anti-retaliation provision.  Throughout \xc2\xa742121(b), the respondent is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  See\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742121(b)(2)(B)(ii) (The Secretary shall not conduct an investigation into a retaliation claim \xe2\x80\x9cif the employer demonstrates,by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action inthe absence of that behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa742121(b)(2)(B)(iv)(\xe2\x80\x9cRelief may not be ordered .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Regarding remedies, \xc2\xa71514A(c)(2) states that a successful claimant shall be entitled to \xe2\x80\x9creinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had, but for the discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of back pay, with interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the Solicitor General, for the United States as amicus curiae, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult, if not impossible, to see how a contractor or subcontractor could provide those remedies to an employee of a public company.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15.  The most sensible reading of \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s numerous references to an employer-employee relationship between the respondent and the claimant is that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s protections run between contractors and their own employees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a strange design.  Under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower\xe2\x80\x9d construction, post, at 2, 3, 4, 7, a public company\xe2\x80\x99s contractor may not retaliate against a public company\xe2\x80\x99s employees, academic here because the public company has no employees.  According to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to prevent \xe2\x80\x9ca gaping hole\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow public companies to \xe2\x80\x9cevade \xc2\xa71514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee could not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 10.  This cannot be right\xe2\x80\x94even if Congress had omitted any reference to contractors, subcontractors, or agents in \xc2\xa71514A, the remaining language surely would prohibit a public company from directing someone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the public company\xe2\x80\x99s employees; hiring an ax-wielder to announce an employee\xe2\x80\x99s demotion does not change the fact that the public company is the entity commanding the demotion.  Under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71514A, the inclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more than make the contractor secondarily liable for complying with such marching orders\xe2\x80\x94hardly a hole at all.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view of \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s reach to prevail: Contractors\xe2\x80\x99 employees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerableto retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistleon a scheme to defraud the public company\xe2\x80\x99s investors, even a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor.  Not only would mutual fund advisers and managers escape \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s control.  Legions of accountants and lawyers would be denied \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s protections.  See infra, at 19\xe2\x80\x9322.  Instead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing babysitters and the like, post, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 6, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, 20, the dissent might pause to consider whether a Congress, prompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whistleblower protection countless professionals equipped to bring fraud on investors to a halt.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR.  First, FMR urges that \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their housekeepers or gardeners.  See Brief for Respondents 19\xe2\x80\x9320; post, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 6, 12\xe2\x80\x9313, 20.  Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General do not defend \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s application to personal employees.  They argue, instead, that the prohibition against an \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d retaliating against \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d may be read as imposing personal liability only on officers and employees who retaliate against other public company employees.  Brief for Petitioners 12; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  FMR calls this reading \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre,\xe2\x80\x9d for it would ascribe to the words \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71514A(a) \xe2\x80\x9cone meaning if the respondent is an \xe2\x80\x98officer\xe2\x80\x99 and a different meaning if the respondent is a \xe2\x80\x98contractor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 20\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor General offer an interpretation at odds with the text Congress enacted.  If, as we hold, \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d includes employees of contractors, then grammatically, the term also includes employees of public company officers and employees.  Nothing suggests Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attention was drawn to the curiosity its drafting produced.  The issue, however, is likely more theoretical than real.  Few housekeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon and comprehend evidence of their employer\xe2\x80\x99s complicity in fraud.  In any event, FMR\xe2\x80\x99s point is outweighed by the compelling arguments opposing FMR\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9can employee\xe2\x80\x9d refers simply and only to public company employees.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9314.  See also infra, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad applications).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings support the exclusion of contractor employees from \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s protections.  Although \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s own heading is broad (\xe2\x80\x9cCivil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases\xe2\x80\x9d), subsection (a) is captioned \xe2\x80\x9cWhistleblower Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, the relevant public law section, \xc2\xa7806 of Sarbanes-Oxley, is captioned \xe2\x80\x9cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  116 Stat. 802.  The Court of Appeals described the latter two headings as \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit guides\xe2\x80\x9d limiting protection under \xc2\xa71514A to employees of public companies.  670 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 69.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This Court has placed less weight on captions.  In Trainmen v.

Indeed, the Senate Report demonstrates that Congress was as focused on the role of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s outside contractors in facilitating the fraud as it was on the actions of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s own officers.  See, e.g., S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 3 (fraud \xe2\x80\x9coccurred with extensive participation and structuring advice from Arthur Andersen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which was simultaneously serving as both consultant and independent auditor for Enron\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); id., at 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cprofessionals from accounting firms, law firms and business consulting firms, who were paid millions to advise Enron on these practices, assured others that Enron was a solid investment\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (team of Andersen employees were tasked with destroying \xe2\x80\x9cphysical evidence and documents\xe2\x80\x9d relating to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s fraud); id., at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cEnron and Andersen were taking advantage of a system that allowed them to behave in an apparently fraudulent manner\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 11 (Enron\xe2\x80\x99s fraud partly attributable to \xe2\x80\x9cthe well-paid professionals who helped create, carry out, and cover up the complicated corporate ruse when they should have been raising concerns\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (\xe2\x80\x9cEnron\xe2\x80\x99s accountants and lawyers brought all their skills and knowledge to bear in assisting the fraud to succeed and then in covering it up.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Also clear from the legislative record is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the employ-ees of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s contractors.  Congressional investigators discovered ample evidence of contractors demoting or dis-charging employees they have engaged who jeopardized the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s business relationship with Enron by objecting to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s financial practices.  See, e.g., Oppel, Merrill Replaced Research Analyst Who Upset Enron, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, July 30, 2002, p.

Emphasizing the importance of outside professionals as \xe2\x80\x9cgatekeepers who detect and deter fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d the Senate Report concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cCongress must reconsider the incentive system that has been set up that encourages accountants and lawyers who come across fraud in their work to remain silent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  From this legislative history, one can safely conclude that Congress enacted \xc2\xa71514A aiming to encourage whistleblowing by contractor employees who suspect fraud involving the public companies with whom they work.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        FMR argues that Congress addressed its concerns about the role of outside accountants and lawyers in facilitating Enron\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing, not in \xc2\xa71514A, but exclusively in other provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly regulat[ing] accountants and lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 40.  In particular, FMR points to sections of the Act requiring accountants and lawyers for public companies to investigate and report misconduct, or risk being banned from further practice before the SEC.  Id., at 41 (citing 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77215(c)(4), 7245).  These requirements, however, indicate why Congress would have wanted to extend \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to the many lawyers and accountants who perform outside work for public companies.  Although lawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regulations and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provision of the Act other than \xc2\xa71514A affords them protection from retaliation by their employers for complying with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s reporting requirements.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  In short, we cannot countenance the position advanced by FMR and the dissent, see post, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316, that Congress intended to leave these professionals vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory action for complying with the law.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our reading of \xc2\xa71514A avoids insulating the entire mutual fund industry from \xc2\xa71514A, as FMR\xe2\x80\x99s and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower construction\xe2\x80\x9d would do.

Because mutual funds figure prominently among such report-filing companies, Congress presumably had them in mind when it added to \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly traded companies\xe2\x80\x9d the discrete category of companies \xe2\x80\x9crequired to file reports under section 15(d).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are managed, instead, by independent investment advisers.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x93184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940).  The United States investment advising industry manages $14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors.  See 2013 Investment Company Fact Book 7 (53d ed.), available at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf (as visited Feb. 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  These investment advisers, under our reading of \xc2\xa71514A, are contractors prohibited from retaliating against their own employees for engaging in whistleblowing activity.  This construction protects the \xe2\x80\x9cinsiders [who] are the only firsthand witnesses to the [shareholder] fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 10.  Under FMR\xe2\x80\x99s and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading, in contrast, \xc2\xa71514A has no application to mutual funds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed by the privately held investment management companies, not by the mutual funds themselves.

See also post, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, n.\xc2\xa010.  But this separate regulation does not remove the problem, for nowhere else in these legislative measures are investment management employees afforded whistleblower protection.

DOL\xe2\x80\x99s regulations have interpreted \xc2\xa71514A as protecting contractor employees for almost a decade.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]  See 69 Fed. Reg. 52105\xe2\x80\x9352106 (2004).  Yet no \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower construction\xe2\x80\x9d advocate has identified even a single case in which the employee of a private contractor has asserted a \xc2\xa71514A claim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud.  FMR\xe2\x80\x99s parade of horribles rests solely on Lockheed Martin Corp. v. ARB, 717 F.\xc2\xa03d 1121 (CA10 2013), a case involving mail and wire fraud claims asserted by an employee of a public company\xe2\x80\x94i.e., claims in no way affected by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s fears that household employees and others, on learning of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, will be prompted to pursue retaliation claims, post, at 13, and that OSHA will find them meritorious under \xc2\xa71514A, seem to us unwarranted.  If we are wrong, however, Congress can easily fix the problem by amending \xc2\xa71514A explicitly to remove personal employees of public company officers and employees from the provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  But it would thwart Congress\xe2\x80\x99 dominant aim if contractors were taken off the hook for retaliating against their whistleblowing employees, just to avoid the unlikely prospect that babysitters, nannies, gardeners, and the like will flood OSHA with \xc2\xa71514A complaints.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General observe that overbreadth problems may be resolved by various limit-ing principles.

Id., at 20 (Government counsel).  We agree.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegations fall squarely within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim in enacting \xc2\xa71514A.  Lawson alleges that she was constructively discharged for reporting accounting practices that overstated expenses associated with managing certain Fidelity mutual funds.  This alleged fraud directly implicates the funds\xe2\x80\x99 shareholders: \xe2\x80\x9cBy inflating its expenses, and thus understating its profits, [FMR] could potentially increase the fees it would earn from the mutual funds, fees ultimately paid by the shareholders of those funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 3.

As the Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically flows from \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s text and broader context.  I therefore join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in principal part.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I do not endorse, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s occasional excursions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and context, into the swamps of legislative history.  Reliance on legislative history rests upon several frail premises.  First, and most important: That the statute means what Congress intended.  It does not.  Because we are a govern-ment of laws, not of men, and are governed by what Congress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole object of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what a law says.  Second: That there was a congressional \xe2\x80\x9cintent\xe2\x80\x9d apart from that reflected in the enacted text.  On most issues of detail that come before this Court, I am confident that the majority of Senators and Representatives had no views whatever on how the issues should be resolved\xe2\x80\x94indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.  Third: That the views expressed in a committee report or a floor statement represent those of all the Members of that House.  Many of them almost certainly did not read the report or hear the statement, much less agree with it\xe2\x80\x94not to mention the Members of the other House and the President who signed the bill.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Since congressional \xe2\x80\x9cintent\xe2\x80\x9d apart from enacted text is fiction to begin with, courts understandably allow themselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is no exception.  It cites parts of the legislative record that are consistent with its holding that \xc2\xa71514A covers employees of private contractors and subcontractors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in the opposite direction.  For example, the following remark by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\xe2\x80\x99s lead sponsor in the Senate: \xe2\x80\x9c[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively to public companies\xe2\x80\x94that is, to companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It is not applicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]] who make up the vast majority of companies across the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Two other minor points in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion I do not agree with.  First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate anti-retaliation provision,\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742121(a), \xe2\x80\x9chas been read\xe2\x80\x9d by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor employees.  Ante, at 29.  Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure,\xe2\x80\x9d contains cross-references to the procedural rules set forth in \xc2\xa742121(b), but the substantive provisions of \xc2\xa71514A(a) are worded quite differently from the substantive prohibition of \xc2\xa742121, which is contained in subsection (a)\xe2\x80\x94thus making interpretation of the latter an unreliable guide to \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  Second, I do not agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the possible validity of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71514A protects contractor employees only to the extent that their whistleblowing relates to \xe2\x80\x98the contractor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fulfilling its role as a contractor for the public company.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 23 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 18\xe2\x80\x9319).  Although that \xe2\x80\x9climiting principl[e],\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., may be appealing from a policy standpoint, it has no basis whatsoever in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  So long as an employee works for one of the actors enumerated in \xc2\xa71514A(a) and reports a covered form of fraud in a manner identified in \xc2\xa71514(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), the employee is protected from retaliation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For all the other reasons given by the Court, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text is clear, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Congressional Record reads \xe2\x80\x9cprovide companies,\xe2\x80\x9d but context as well as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener\xe2\x80\x99s error for \xe2\x80\x9cprivate companies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970833">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 12\xe2\x80\x933</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">JACKIE HOSANG LAWSON and JONATHAN M.

The Court recognizes that the core purpose of the Act is to \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard investors in public companies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 1.  And the Court points out that Congress entitled the whistleblower provision, \xe2\x80\x9cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7806,\n\n116Stat.\n802.  Despite these clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe \xc2\xa71514A to apply only to public company employees who blow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company employers.  The Court instead holds that the law encompasses any household employee of the millions of people who work for a public company and any employee of the hundreds of thousands of private businesses that contract</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> to perform work for a public company.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation gives \xc2\xa71514A a stunning reach.  As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act au-thorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his employer\xe2\x80\x94a parent who happens to work at the local Walmart (a public company)\xe2\x80\x94if the parent stops employing the babysitter after he expresses concern that the parent\xe2\x80\x99s teenage son may have participated in an Internet purchase fraud.  And it opens the door to a cause of action against a small business that contracts to clean the local Starbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted after reporting that another nonpublic company client has mailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweeping regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and private businesses to litigation over fraud reports that have no connection to, or impact on, the interests of pub-lic company shareholders.  But because nothing in the text, context, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests that Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with the statutory text, it fails to recognize that \xc2\xa71514A is deeply ambiguous.  Three indicators of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent clearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A: the statute\xe2\x80\x99s headings, the statutory context, and the absurd results that follow from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relevant syntactic elements\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71514A are that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cno . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  After \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98boiling . . . down\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the text to this formulation, the majority concludes that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x98an employee\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is obviously \xe2\x80\x9cthe contractor\xe2\x80\x99s own employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If that were what the statute said, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision would undoubtedly be correct.  But \xc2\xa71514A(a) actu-ally provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  The provision thus does not speak only (or even primarily) to \xe2\x80\x9ccontractors.\xe2\x80\x9d  It speaks to public companies, and then includes a list of five types of representatives that companies hire to carry out their business: \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s], [and] agent[s].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous.  The majority is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause of action both for employees of public companies and for employees of the enumerated public company representatives.  But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to prohibit the public company and the listed representatives\xe2\x80\x94all of whom act on the company\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xe2\x80\x94from retaliating against just the public company\xe2\x80\x99s employees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense when one considers the other terms in the list of com-pany representatives.  The majority acknowledges that, as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cgramma[r],\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of protected employees must be consistent with respect to all five types of com-pany representatives listed in \xc2\xa71514A(a).  Ante, at 15.  Yet the Government and petitioners readily concede that \xc2\xa71514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated repre-sentatives\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from retaliating against other employees of the public company, as opposed to their own babysitters and housekeepers.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 (\xc2\xa71514A \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] personal liability on corporate officers and employees who are involved in retaliation against other employees of their employer\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioners 12 (similar).  The Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Administrative Review Board (ARB) agrees.  Spinner v.

And if \xc2\xa71514A prohibits an \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cemployee\xe2\x80\x9d of a public company from retaliating against only the public company\xe2\x80\x99s own employees, then as the majority points out, the same should be true \xe2\x80\x9cgrammatically\xe2\x80\x9d of contractors, subcontractors, and agents as well, ante, at 15.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority responds by suggesting that the narrower interpretation could have been clearer if Congress had added the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of a public company\xe2\x80\x99 after \xe2\x80\x98an em-ployee.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Fair enough.  But Congress could more clearly have dictated the majority\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute, too: It could have specified that public companies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and agents may not retaliate against \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any case, that Congress could have spoken with greater specificity in both directions only underscores that the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous.  To resolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of intent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a statute\xe2\x80\x99s titles can offer \xe2\x80\x9ca useful aid in resolving [the]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ambiguity.\xe2\x80\x9d  FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385\n\xe2\x80\x93389 (1959).  Here, two headings strongly suggest that Congress intended \xc2\xa71514A to apply only to employees of public companies.  First, the title of \xc2\xa7806\xe2\x80\x94the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x94speaks clearly to the scope of employees protected by the provision: \xe2\x80\x9cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n116Stat.\n802.  Second, the heading of \xc2\xa71514A(a) reinforces that the provision provides \xe2\x80\x9c[w]histleblower protection for employees of publicly traded companies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority suggests that in covering \xe2\x80\x9cemployees of publicly traded companies,\xe2\x80\x9d the headings may be imprecise.  Ante, at 16.  Section 1514A(a) technically applies to the employees of two types of companies: those \xe2\x80\x9cwith a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\xe2\x80\x9d and those that are \xe2\x80\x9crequired to file reports under section 15(d) of the\xe2\x80\x9d same Act.  Both types of companies are \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d in that they are publicly owned.  See ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The difference is that shares of the \xc2\xa712 companies are listed and traded on a national securities exchange; \xc2\xa715(d) companies, by contrast, exchange their securities directly with the public.  The headings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly traded\xe2\x80\x9d is commonly associated with companies whose securities are traded on national exchanges.  Congress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer to \xc2\xa715(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are traded publicly, too.  For instance, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic example of a \xc2\xa715(d) company.  And mutual funds, like other \xc2\xa715(d) companies, are both publicly owned and widely traded; the trades just take place typically between the fund and its investors directly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any case, even if referring to employees of \xc2\xa712 and \xc2\xa715(d) companies together as \xe2\x80\x9cemployees of publicly traded companies\xe2\x80\x9d may be slightly imprecise, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s competing interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A would stretch the stat-ute\xe2\x80\x99s headings far past the point of recognition.  As the majority understands the law, Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cemployees of publicly traded companies\xe2\x80\x9d as shorthand not just for (1) employees of \xc2\xa712 and \xc2\xa715(d) companies, but also for (2) household employees of any individual who works for a \xc2\xa712 or \xc2\xa715(d) company; (3) employees of any private company that contracts with a \xc2\xa712 or \xc2\xa715(d) company; (4) employees of any private company that, even ifit does not contract with a public company, subcontracts with a private company that does; and (5) employees of any agent of a \xc2\xa712 or \xc2\xa715(d) company.  If Congress had wanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would have called it something other than \xe2\x80\x9c[w]histleblower protection for employees of publicly traded companies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are inconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes that the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cplaced less weight on captions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16.  But where the captions favor one interpretation so decisively, their significance should not be dismissed so quickly.  As we have explained, headings are important \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tools available for the resolution of a doubt\xe2\x80\x99 about the meaning of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n\n523 U. S. 224,\n234 (1998)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Statutory context confirms that Congress intended \xc2\xa71514A to apply only to employees of public companies.  To start, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a whole evinces a clear focus on public companies.  Congress stated in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s preamble that its objective was to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n116Stat.\n745, disclosures that public companies alone must file.  The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations for public companies, \xc2\xa7401; added new conflict of interest rules for their executives, \xc2\xa7402; increased the responsibilities of their audit committees, \xc2\xa7301; and created new rules governing insider trading by their executives and directors, \xc2\xa7306.  The common denominator among all of these provisions is their singular focus on the activities of public companies. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When Congress wanted to depart from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s public company focus to regulate private firms and their employees, it spoke clearly.  For example, \xc2\xa7307 of the Act ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue rules \xe2\x80\x9csetting forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the [SEC],\xe2\x80\x9d including a rule requiring outside counsel to report violations of the securities laws to public company officers and directors.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77245.  Similarly, Title I of the Act created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authorityto register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately held outside accounting firms and their employees.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211\xe2\x80\x937215.  And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules governing outside securities analysts when they make public recommendations regarding securities.  \xc2\xa778o\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously cover the employees of private businesses that contract with public companies or the employees of individuals who work for public companies.  Far from it, for the reasons noted above.  Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act demonstrates, if Congress had really wanted \xc2\xa71514A to impose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it would have said so more clearly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to adopt the narrower understanding of \xc2\xa71514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the whistleblower provision that served as its model.  That provision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century,\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742121, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o air carrier or contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier\xe2\x80\x9d may retaliate against an employee who reports a potential airline safety violation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 42121 protects employees of contractors.  But as the majority acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress strayed\xe2\x80\x9d from \xc2\xa742121 in significant ways when it wrote \xc2\xa71514A.  Ante,at 29.  First, \xc2\xa742121 specifically defines the term \xe2\x80\x9ccon-tractor,\xe2\x80\x9d limiting the term to \xe2\x80\x9ca company that performs safetysensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa742121(e).  That is in notable distinction to \xc2\xa71514A, which does not define the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d as a particular type of company, instead placing the term in a list alongside individual \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d who act on a company\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Second, unlike \xc2\xa742121, \xc2\xa71514A sets off the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate clause that is subsidiary to the primary subject of the provision\xe2\x80\x94the public company itself.  Third, the title of \xc2\xa742121 is \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rotection of employees providing air safety information,\xe2\x80\x9d a title that comfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.  Not so of \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s headings, as explained above.  In short, \xc2\xa742121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if it wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet chose to depart from that model in several important ways.  We should not presume that choice to be accidental.  See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 723,\n734 (1975)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority relies on statutory context as well, but its examples are unconvincing.  It first argues that the types of conduct prohibited by the statute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdischarge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly actions an employer takes against its own employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  The problem is that \xc2\xa71514A does not forbid retaliation by an \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d; it forbids retaliation by a \xe2\x80\x9c[public] company . . . or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.\xe2\x80\x9d  For the reasons already discussed, Congress could have reasonably included the five types of representatives not in their capacity as employers, but rather as representatives of the company who are barred from retaliating against a public company\xe2\x80\x99s employees on the company\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely \xe2\x80\x9cpositioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  That misconceives the nature of modern work forces, which increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and persons laboring under more typical employment relationships.  For example, public companies often hire \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contractors,\xe2\x80\x9d of whom there are more than 10 million,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] and contract workers,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] of whom there are more than 11 million.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  And they employ outside lawyers, accountants, and auditors as well.  While not every person who works for a public company in these nonemployee capacities may be positioned to threaten or harass em-</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">ployees of the public company, many are.  See, e.g., Tides v. The Boeing Co., 644 F. 3d 809, 811 (CA9 2011) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9capproximately seventy contract auditors from [an] accounting firm\xe2\x80\x9d possessed \xe2\x80\x9cmanagerial authority\xe2\x80\x9d over the 10 Boeing employees in the company\xe2\x80\x99s audit division).  Congress therefore had as much reason to shield a public company\xe2\x80\x99s employees from retaliation by the company\xe2\x80\x99s contractors as it had to bar retaliation by officers and employees.  Otherwise, the statute would have had a gaping hole\xe2\x80\x94a public company could evade \xc2\xa71514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee could not.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence of \xe2\x80\x9coutplacement\xe2\x80\x9d firms, or consultants that help companies determine whom to fire.  See ante, at 11.  Companies spent $3.6 billion on these services in 2009 alone.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Congress surely could have meant to protect public company employees against retaliation at the hands of such firms, especially in the event that the public company itself goes bankrupt (as companies engaged in fraud often do).  See, e.g., Kalkunte v. DVI Financial Servs., Inc., No. 05\xe2\x80\x93139 etc., ALJ No. 2004\xe2\x80\x93SOX\xe2\x80\x93056 (Feb. 27, 2009) (former employee of bankrupt public company permitted to bring \xc2\xa71514A action against corporate restructuring firm that terminated her employment).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority points next to the remedies afforded by \xc2\xa71514A(c), which authorizes \xe2\x80\x9call relief necessary to make the employee whole,\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to \xe2\x80\x9creinstatement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cback pay,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecial damages . . . including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority posits that Congress could not have intended to bar contractors from retaliating against public company employees because one of the remedies (reinstatement) would likely be outside of the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s power.  Ante, at 13.  But there is no requirement that a statute must make every type of remedy available against every type of defendant.  A contractor can compensate a whistleblower with backpay, costs, and fees, and that is more than</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">enough for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme to make sense.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the affirmative defense for public company \xe2\x80\x9cemployers\xe2\x80\x9d who lack \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that an employee has participated in a proceeding relating to the fraud report, ante, at 12 (citing \xc2\xa71514(A)(a)(2)), fails for a similar reason.  There is no rule that Congress may only provide an affirmative defense if it is available to every conceivable defendant.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading runs afoul of the precept that \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are avail-able.\xe2\x80\x9d  Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 564,\n575 (1982)\n.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation transforms \xc2\xa71514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress could not have intended.  As construed by the majority, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relationships between individuals and their nannies, housekeepers, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to litigation if their employees claim to have been harassed for providing information regarding any of a host of offenses.  If, for example, a nanny is discharged after expressing a concern to his employer that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s teenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud, the nanny can bring a \xc2\xa71514A suit.  The employer may prevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d the fraud report.  \xc2\xa71514A.  But there is little reason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes into federal court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to impose costly litigation burdens on any private business that happens to have an ongoing contract with a public company.  As the majority acknowledges, the purpose of the Act was to protect public company investors and the financial markets.  Yet the majority might well embroil federal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane labor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.  For instance, a construction worker could file a \xc2\xa71514A suit against her employer (that has a long-term contract with a public company) if the worker is demoted after reporting that another client has mailed the company a false invoice.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>] </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation also produces truly odd distinctions.  Under the rule it announces, a babysitter can bring a \xc2\xa71514A retaliation suit against his employerif his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart (a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the local Petco (a private company).  Likewise, the day laborer who works for a construction business can avail himself of \xc2\xa71514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the local Dick\xe2\x80\x99s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but not if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private company).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In light of the reasonable alternative reading of \xc2\xa71514A, there is no reason to accept these absurd results.  The majority begs to differ, arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is scant evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude of newly covered employees \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98who have no exposure to investor-related activities and thus could not possibly</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">assist in detecting investor fraud.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  Until today, however, no court has deemed \xc2\xa71514A applicable to household employees of individuals who work for public companies; even the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s ARB rejected that view.  Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\xe2\x80\x93SOX\xe2\x80\x93029, at 8.  And as the District Court noted, prior to the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 decision in Spinner, the ARB \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] yet to provide . . . definitive clarification\xe2\x80\x9d on the question whether \xc2\xa71514A extends to the employees of a public company\xe2\x80\x99s private contractors.  724 F. Supp. 2d 141, 155 (Mass. 2010).  So the fact that individuals and private businesses have yet to suffer burdensome litigation offers little assurance that the ma-jority\xe2\x80\x99s capacious reading of \xc2\xa71514A will produce no un-toward effects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, it must be noted that \xc2\xa71514A protects the reporting of a variety of frauds\xe2\x80\x94not only securities fraud, but also mail, wire, and bank fraud.  By interpreting a statute that already protects an expansive class of conduct also to cover a large class of employees, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion threatens to subject private companies to a costly new front of employment litigation.  Congress almost certainly did not intend the statute to have that reach.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority argues that the broader reading of \xc2\xa71514A is necessary because a small number of the millions of individuals and private companies affected by its ruling have a special role to play in preventing public company fraud.  If \xc2\xa71514A does not bar retaliation against employees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms and accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their employees when those employees report fraud on the part of their public company clients.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role that outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron debacle and the importance of encouraging them to play an active part in preventing future scandals.  But it hardly follows that Congress must have meant to apply \xc2\xa71514A to every employee of every public company contractor, subcontractor, officer, and employee as a result.  It is far more likely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and professional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and accountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the hands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Specifically, rather than imposing \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s generic approach on outside accounting firms, Congress established the PCAOB, which regulates \xe2\x80\x9cevery detail\xe2\x80\x9d of an accounting firm\xe2\x80\x99s practice, including \xe2\x80\x9csupervision of au-dit work,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinternal inspection procedures,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional ethics rules,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98such other requirements as the Board may prescribe.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).  Importantly, the PCAOB is empowered to levy \xe2\x80\x9csevere sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to and including the permanent revocation of a firm\xe2\x80\x99s registration . . . and money penalties of $15 million.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citing\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77215(c)(4)).  Such sanctions could well provide a more powerful incentive to prevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its employees than \xc2\xa71514A.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory authority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys.  The Act requires the SEC to establish rules of professional conduct for attorneys, \xc2\xa7307 (codified at\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77245), and confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys for \xe2\x80\x9cimproper professional conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d which would include, for example, a law firm partner\xe2\x80\x99s decision to retaliate against an associate who reports fraud.  \xc2\xa7602 (codified at\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x933).  Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the power to censure culpable attorneys and to deny \xe2\x80\x9cpermanently\xe2\x80\x9d to any such attorney the \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege of appearing of practicing before\xe2\x80\x9d the SEC \xe2\x80\x9cin any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7602.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress thus evidently made the judgment that decisions concerning how best to punish law firms and accounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department of Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB.  Such judgment should not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much less at the cost to congressional intent produced by today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  The majority does offer cogent policy arguments for why Congress might have been wiser to include certain types of contractors within \xc2\xa71514A, noting for example that a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retaliate against its employees for making reports required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Ante, at 19.  But as the majority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that precise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower incentive and protection program that unequivocally \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] any employer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94public or private\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfrom re-taliating against \xe2\x80\x98a whistleblower\xe2\x80\x99 for providing information to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or making disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-Oxley and certain other securities laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 26 (citing 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(a)(6), (b)(1), (h)).  The majority thus acknowledges that, moving forward, retaliation claims like the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 may \xe2\x80\x9cprocee[d] under [\xc2\xa778u-6],\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 26, n.\xc2\xa017.  In other words, to the extent the major-ity worries about a \xe2\x80\x9chole\xe2\x80\x9d in FMR\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, ante,at 14, Congress has already addressed it.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because the statute is ambiguous, and because the majority\xe2\x80\x99s broad interpretation has also been adopted by the ARB, there remains the question whether the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\xe2\x80\x93SOX\xe2\x80\x93029, is entitled to deference under Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837 (1984)\n.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  Under United States v. Mead Corp.,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93227 (2001), an agency may claim Chevron deference \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears [1] that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and [2] that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neither requirement is met here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, the agency interpretation for which petitioners claim deference is the position announced by the ARB, the board to which the Secretary of Labor has delegated authority \xe2\x80\x9cin review or on appeal\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with \xc2\xa71514A proceedings.  75 Fed. Reg. 3924 (2010).  According to petitioners, the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s rulings are entitled to deference because the \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary is responsible for enforcing Section 1514A both through investigation and through formal adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 61.  That is right as far as it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to investigate and adjudicate \xc2\xa71514A claims, Congress did not delegate authority to the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cmake rules carrying the force of law,\xe2\x80\x9d Mead, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  Congress instead delegated that power to the SEC: Section 3(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77202(a), provides that the SEC \xe2\x80\x9cshall promulgate such rules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and in furtherance of this Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  So if any agency has the authority to resolve ambiguities in \xc2\xa71514A with the forceof law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.See Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144,\n154 (1991)\n.  The SEC, however, has not issued a regulation applying \xc2\xa71514A whistleblower protection to employees of public company contractors.  And while the majority notes that the SEC may share the (incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has interpretive authority regarding \xc2\xa71514A, ante, at 9, n.\xc2\xa06, the majority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may transfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Congress to a different agency simply by signing onto an amicus brief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to resolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism for judicial review.  The statute does not merely permit courts to review the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s final adjudicatory rulings under the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s defer-ential standard.  It instead allows a claimant to bring an action in a federal district court, and allows district courts to adjudicate such actions de\xc2\xa0novo, in any case where the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.  That is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of the three-tiered process of agency review of \xc2\xa71514A claims.  See ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  As a result, even if Congress had not delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambiguities in \xc2\xa71514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review suggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts, and not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power.  See Mead, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs Service classifications where, among other things, the statute authorized \xe2\x80\x9cindependent review of Customs classifications by the [Court of International Trade]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress had delegated authority to the Secretary to make \xe2\x80\x9crules carrying the force of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cagency interpretation claiming deference\xe2\x80\x9d in this case was not \xe2\x80\x9cpromulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.  That is because the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymaking authority he may have with respect to \xc2\xa71514A in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) instead of the ARB.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002).  In fact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB any power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe [ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of any portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has been duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and shall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in its decisions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71514A.

As a result, the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s coverage in Spinner was not an \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of [the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s] authority\xe2\x80\x9d to make rules carrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227, but rather the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s necessary compliance with a regulation that no one claims is deserving of deference in the first place.  See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\xe2\x80\x93SOX\xe2\x80\x93029, at 10 (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ARB is bound by the [Department of Labor] regulations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the absence of Chevron deference, the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Spinner may claim only \xe2\x80\x9crespect according to its persuasiveness\xe2\x80\x9d under Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.\xc2\xa0S.134 (1944).  See Mead, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 221.  But the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already discussed. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A undeniably serves a laudatory purpose.  By covering employees of every of-ficer, employee, and contractor of every public company, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation extends \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s protections to the outside lawyers and accountants who could have helped prevent the Enron fraud.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But that is not the statute Congress wrote.  Congress envisioned a system in which public company employees would be covered by \xc2\xa71514A, and in which outside lawyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be regulated by the SEC and PCAOB.  Congress did not envision a system in which employees of other private businesses\xe2\x80\x94such as cleaning and construction company workers who have little interaction with investor-related activities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting fraud against shareholders\xe2\x80\x94would fall within \xc2\xa71514A.  Nor, needless to say, did it envision \xc2\xa71514A applying to the household employees of millions of individuals who happen to work for public companies\xe2\x80\x94housekeepers, gardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned to prevent fraud against public company investors.  And to the extent \xc2\xa71514A may have been underinclusive as first drafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any gaps.  See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7922, 929A,\n\n124Stat.\n1848,\n1852 (extending \xc2\xa71514A to credit rating agencies and public company subsidiaries); \xc2\xa7922, id., at 1841\xe2\x80\x931848 (codifying additional whistleblower incentive and protection program at\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upsets the balance struck by Congress.  Fortunately, just as Congress has added further protections to the system it originally designed when necessary, so too may Congress now respond to limit the far-reaching implications of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  But because that interpretation relies on a debatable view of \xc2\xa71514A\xe2\x80\x99s text, is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s titles and its context, and leads to absurd results that Congress did not intend, I respectfully dissent. </p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic company\xe2\x80\x9d as shorthand for\n\xe2\x80\x99s reference to companies that either have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98required to file reports under section 15(d).\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d   at 7\xe2\x80\x938.

It surely does, but that is the point\xe2\x80\x94the whole reason \xc2\xa71514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly forbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through \xe2\x80\x9cany officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The prohibition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain (hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to retaliate through its \xe2\x80\x9cofficers and employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, while the majority concedes that, under the narrower reading of \xc2\xa71514A, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d imposes secondary liability in the event a public company is judgment proof,  at 13, the majority fails to recognize that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the term also imposes primary liability against contractors who threaten public company employees without direction from the company.  Thus, for example, FMR\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71514A would prevent an outside accountant from threatening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the accountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the whistle on that fraud.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010, www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/01/getting_the_ax_from_george_clooney.html.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that an outplacement firm would likely be acting as an \xe2\x80\x9cagent\xe2\x80\x9d for the public company, such that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 additional inclusion of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontractor\xe2\x80\x9d would be superfluous under the narrower reading of \xc2\xa71514A.  at 11, n.\xc2\xa09.
