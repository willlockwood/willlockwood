Because this decision seemed to conflict with prior holdings of this Court, we granted certiorari.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/1050/case.html">474 U. S. 1050</a></span> (1986).  We conclude that the admissibility of this kind of statement is governed by state rules of evidence, rather than by our previous decisions regarding coerced confessions and <em>Miranda</em> waivers.  We therefore reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 479 U. S. 160</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On August 18, 1983, Officer Patrick Anderson of the Denver Police Department was in uniform, working in an off-duty capacity in downtown Denver.  Respondent Francis Connelly approached Officer Anderson and, without any prompting, stated that he had murdered someone and wanted to talk about it.  Anderson immediately advised respondent that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in court, and that he had the right to an attorney prior to any police questioning.  <em>See Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966).  Respondent stated that he understood these rights, but he still wanted to talk about the murder.  Understandably bewildered by this confession, Officer Anderson asked respondent several questions.  Connelly denied that he had been drinking, denied that he had been taking any drugs, and stated that, in the past, he had been a patient in several mental hospitals.  Officer Anderson again told Connelly that he was under no obligation to say anything.  Connelly replied that it was "all right," and that he would talk to Officer Anderson because his conscience had been bothering him.  To Officer Anderson, respondent appeared to understand fully the nature of his acts.  Tr. 19.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Homicide Detective Stephen Antuna arrived.  Respondent was again advised of his rights, and Detective Antuna asked him "what he had on his mind."  <em>Id.</em> at 24.  Respondent answered that he had come all the way from Boston to confess to the murder of Mary Ann Junta, a young girl whom he had killed in Denver sometime during November, 1982.  Respondent was taken to police headquarters, and a search of police records revealed that the body of an unidentified female had been found in April, 1983.  Respondent openly detailed his story to Detective Antuna and Sergeant Thomas Haney, and readily agreed to take the officers to the scene of the killing.  Under Connelly\'s sole direction, the two officers and respondent proceeded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 479 U. S. 161</a></p><p> in a police vehicle to the location of the crime.  Respondent pointed out the exact location of the murder.  Throughout this episode, Detective Antuna perceived no indication whatsoever that respondent was suffering from any kind of mental illness.  <em>Id.</em> at 33-34.</p>\n<p>Respondent was held overnight.  During an interview with the public defender\'s office the following morning, he became visibly disoriented.  He began giving confused answers to questions, and for the first time, stated that "voices" had told him to come to Denver and that he had followed the directions of these voices in confessing.  <em>Id.</em> at 42.  Respondent was sent to a state hospital for evaluation.  He was initially found incompetent to assist in his own defense.  By March, 1984, however, the doctors evaluating respondent determined that he was competent to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p>At a preliminary hearing, respondent moved to suppress all of his statements.  Dr. Jeffrey Metzner, a psychiatrist employed by the state hospital, testified that respondent was suffering from chronic schizophrenia and was in a psychotic state at least as of August 17, 1983, the day before he confessed.  Metzner\'s interviews with respondent revealed that respondent was following the "voice of God."  This voice instructed respondent to withdraw money from the bank, to buy an airplane ticket, and to fly from Boston to Denver.  When respondent arrived from Boston, God\'s voice became stronger and told respondent either to confess to the killing or to commit suicide.  Reluctantly following the command of the voices, respondent approached Officer Anderson </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 479 U. S. 162</a></p><p> and confessed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Metzner testified that, in his expert opinion, respondent was experiencing "command hallucinations."  <em>Id.</em> at 56.  This condition interfered with respondent\'s "volitional abilities -- that is, his ability to make free and rational choices."  <em>Ibid.</em>   Dr. Metzner further testified that Connelly\'s illness did not significantly impair his cognitive abilities.  Thus, respondent understood the rights he had when Officer Anderson and Detective Antuna advised him that he need not speak.  <em>Id.</em> at 56-57.  Dr. Metzner admitted that the "voices" could in reality be Connelly\'s interpretation of his own guilt, but explained that, in his opinion, Connelly\'s psychosis motivated his confession.</p>\n<p>On the basis of this evidence, the Colorado trial court decided that respondent\'s statements must be suppressed because they were "involuntary."  Relying on our decisions in <em>Townsend v. Sain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html">372 U. S. 293</a></span> (1963), and <em>Culombe v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/568/case.html">367 U. S. 568</a></span> (1961), the court ruled that a confession is admissible only if it is a product of the defendant\'s rational intellect and "free will."  Tr. 88.  Although the court found that the police had done nothing wrong or coercive in securing respondent\'s confession, Connelly\'s illness destroyed his volition and compelled him to confess.  <em>Id.</em> at 89.  The trial court also found that Connelly\'s mental state vitiated his attempted waiver of the right to counsel and the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.  Accordingly, respondent\'s initial statements and his custodial confession were suppressed.  <em>Id.</em> at 90.</p>\n<p>The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed.  702 P.2d 722 (1985).  In that court\'s view, the proper test for admissibility is whether the statements are "the product of a rational intellect and a free will."  <em>Id.</em> at 728.  Indeed,</p>\n<p>"the absence of police coercion or duress does not foreclose a finding of involuntariness.  One\'s capacity for rational judgment and free choice may be overborne as much by certain forms of severe mental illness as by external pressure."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The court found that the very admission of the evidence in a court of law was sufficient state action to implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The evidence fully supported the conclusion that respondent\'s initial statement was not the product of a rational intellect and a free will.  The court then considered respondent\'s attempted waiver of his constitutional rights and found that respondent\'s mental condition precluded his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="163">Page 479 U. S. 163</a></p><p> ability to make a valid waiver.  <em>Id.</em> at 729.  The Colorado Supreme Court thus affirmed the trial court\'s decision to suppress all of Connelly\'s statements.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."  Just last Term, in <em>Miller v. Fenton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html">474 U. S. 104</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html#109">474 U. S. 109</a></span> (1985), we held that, by virtue of the Due Process Clause,</p>\n<p>"certain interrogation techniques, either in isolation or as applied to the unique characteristics of a particular suspect, are so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned."</p>\n<p><em>See also Moran v. Burbine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html">475 U. S. 412</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#432">475 U. S. 432</a></span>-434 (1986).</p>\n<p>Indeed, coercive government misconduct was the catalyst for this Court\'s seminal confession case, <em>Brown v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html">297 U. S. 278</a></span> (1936).  In that case, police officers extracted confessions from the accused through brutal torture.  The Court had little difficulty concluding that, even though the Fifth Amendment did not at that time apply to the States, the actions of the police were "revolting to the sense of justice." <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html#286">297 U. S. 286</a></span>.  The Court has retained this due process focus, even after holding, in <em>Malloy v. Hogan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/1/case.html">378 U. S. 1</a></span> (1964), that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies to the States.  <em>See Miller v. Fenton, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html#109">474 U. S. 109</a></span>-110.</p>\n<p>Thus, the cases considered by this Court over the 50 years since <em>Brown v. Mississippi</em> have focused upon the crucial element of police overreaching. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  While each confession case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 479 U. S. 164</a></p><p> has turned on its own set of factors justifying the conclusion that police conduct was oppressive, all have contained a substantial element of coercive police conduct.  Absent police conduct causally related to the confession, there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent correctly notes that, as interrogators have turned to more subtle forms of psychological persuasion, courTs have found the mental condition of the defendant a more significant factor in the "voluntariness" calculus.  <em>See Spano v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/315/case.html">360 U. S. 315</a></span> (1959).  But this fact does not justify a conclusion that a defendant\'s mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry into constitutional "voluntariness."</p>\n<p>Respondent relies on <em>Blackburn v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/199/case.html">361 U. S. 199</a></span> (1960), and <em>Townsend v. Sain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html">372 U. S. 293</a></span> (1963), for the proposition that the "deficient mental condition of the defendants in those cases was sufficient to render their confessions involuntary."  Brief for Respondent 20.  But respondent\'s reading of <em>Blackburn</em> and <em>Townsend</em> ignores the integral element of police overreaching present in both cases.  In <em>Blackburn,</em> the Court found that the petitioner was probably insane at the time of his confession, and the police learned during the interrogation that he had a history of mental problems.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 479 U. S. 165</a></p><p> The police exploited this weakness with coercive tactics:</p>\n<p>"the eight- to nine-hour sustained interrogation in a tiny room which was upon occasion literally filled with police officers; the absence of Blackburn\'s friends, relatives, or legal counsel; [and] the composition of the confession by the Deputy Sheriff, rather than by Blackburn."</p>\n<p>361 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/199/case.html#207">361 U. S. 207</a></span>-208.  These tactics supported a finding that the confession was involuntary.  Indeed, the Court specifically condemned police activity that "wrings a confession out of an accused against his will."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/199/case.html#206">361 U. S. 206</a></span>-207.  <em>Townsend</em> presented a similar instance of police wrongdoing.  In that case, a police physician had given <em>Townsend</em> a drug with truth serum properties.  372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html#298">372 U. S. 298</a></span>-299.  The subsequent confession, obtained by officers who knew that <em>Townsend</em> had been given drugs, was held involuntary.  These two cases demonstrate that, while mental condition is surely relevant to an individual\'s susceptibility to police coercion, mere examination of the confessant\'s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry.</p>\n<p>Our "involuntary confession" jurisprudence is entirely consistent with the settled law requiring some sort of "state action" to support a claim of violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Colorado trial court, of course, found that the police committed no wrongful acts, and that finding has been neither challenged by respondent nor disturbed by the Supreme Court of Colorado.  The latter court, however, concluded that sufficient state action was present by virtue of the admission of the confession into evidence in a court of the State.  702 P.2d at 728-729.</p>\n<p>The difficulty with the approach of the Supreme Court of Colorado is that it fails to recognize the essential link between coercive activity of the State, on the one hand, and a resulting confession by a defendant, on the other.  The flaw in respondent\'s constitutional argument is that it would expand our previous line of "voluntariness" cases into a far-ranging requirement that courts must divine a defendant\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 479 U. S. 166</a></p><p> motivation for speaking or acting as he did even though there be no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision.</p>\n<p>The most outrageous behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that evidence inadmissible under the Due Process Clause.  <em>See Walter v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/649/case.html">447 U.

Moreover, suppressing respondent\'s statements would serve absolutely no purpose in enforcing constitutional guarantees.  The purpose of excluding evidence seized in violation of the Constitution is to substantially deter future violations of the Constitution.  <em>See United States v.

Only if we were to establish a brand new constitutional right -- the right of a criminal defendant to confess to his crime only when totally rational and properly motivated -- could respondent\'s present claim be sustained.</p>\n<p>We have previously cautioned against expanding</p>\n<p>"currently applicable exclusionary rules by erecting additional barriers to placing truthful and probative evidence before state juries. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Lego v.

"[T]he central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\'s guilt or innocence," <em>Delaware v.

Respondent would now have us require </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 479 U. S. 167</a></p><p> sweeping inquiries into the state of mind of a criminal defendant who has confessed, inquiries quite divorced from any coercion brought to bear on the defendant by the State.  We think the Constitution rightly leaves this sort of inquiry to be resolved by state laws governing the admission of evidence, and erects no standard of its own in this area.  A statement rendered by one in the condition of respondent might be proved to be quite unreliable, but this is a matter to be governed by the evidentiary laws of the forum, <em>see, e.g.,</em> Fed.Rule Evid. 601, and not by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>"The aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence, whether true or false."</p>\n<p><em>Lisenba v.

We also conclude that the taking of respondent\'s statements, and their admission into evidence, constitute no violation of that Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Colorado went on to affirm the trial court\'s ruling that respondent\'s later statements made while in custody should be suppressed because respondent had not waived his right to consult an attorney and his right to remain silent.  That court held that the State must bear its burden of proving waiver of these <em>Miranda</em> rights by "clear and convincing evidence."  702 P.2d at 729.  Although we have stated in passing that the State bears a "heavy" burden in proving waiver, <em>Tague v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/469/case.html">444 U.

Twomey, supra,</em> this Court upheld a procedure in which the State established the voluntariness of a confession by no more than a preponderance of the evidence.  We upheld it for two reasons.  First, the voluntariness determination has nothing to do with the reliability of jury verdicts; rather, it is designed to determine the presence of police coercion.  Thus, voluntariness is irrelevant to the presence or absence of the elements of a crime, which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>See In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U. S. 358</a></span> (1970).  Second, we rejected Lego\'s assertion that a high burden of proof was required to serve the values protected by the exclusionary rule.  We surveyed the various reasons for excluding evidence, including a violation of the requirements of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra,</em> and we stated that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n each instance, and without regard to its probative value, evidence is kept from the trier of guilt or innocence for reasons wholly apart from enhancing the reliability of verdicts."</p>\n<p><em>Lego v.

Moreover, we rejected the argument that</p>\n<p>"the importance of the values served by exclusionary rules is itself sufficient demonstration that the Constitution also requires admissibility to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Indeed, the Court found that</p>\n<p>"no substantial evidence has accumulated that federal rights have suffered from determining admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We now reaffirm our holding in <em>Lego:</em>  whenever the State bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the defendant claims was obtained in violation of our <em>Miranda</em> doctrine, the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>See Nix v. Williams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/431/case.html">467 U.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Of course, a waiver must at a minimum be "voluntary" to be effective against an accused.  <em>Miranda, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#444">384 U.

The Supreme Court of Colorado, in addressing this question, relied on the testimony of the court-appointed psychiatrist to the effect that respondent was not capable of making a</p>\n<p>"free decision with respect to his constitutional right of silence . . . and his constitutional right to confer with a lawyer before talking to the police."</p>\n<p>702 P.2d at 729.</p>\n<p>We think that the Supreme Court of Colorado erred in importing into this area of constitutional law notions of "free will" that have no place there.  There is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a "voluntariness" inquiry in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 479 U. S. 170</a></p><p> <em>Miranda</em> waiver context than in the Fourteenth Amendment confession context.  The sole concern of the Fifth Amendment, on which <em>Miranda</em> was based, is governmental coercion.  <em>See United States v. Washington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/181/case.html">431 U.

Indeed, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned "with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion."  <em>Oregon v.

The voluntariness of a waiver of this privilege has always depended on the absence of police overreaching, not on "free choice" in any broader sense of the word.  <em>See Moran v. Burbine,</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#421">475 U.

The officers did not intimidate or threaten respondent in any way.  Their questioning was restrained and free from the abuses that so concerned the Court in <em>Miranda</em>").</p>\n<p>Respondent urges this Court to adopt his "free will" rationale, and to find an attempted waiver invalid whenever the defendant feels compelled to waive his rights by reason of any compulsion, even if the compulsion does not flow from the police.  But such a treatment of the waiver issue would "cut this Court\'s holding in [<em>Miranda</em>] completely loose from its own explicitly stated rationale."  <em>Beckwith v.

Even if that is the case, however, we nonetheless reverse the judgment in its entirety because of our belief that the Supreme Court of Colorado\'s analysis was influenced by its mistaken view of "voluntariness" in the constitutional sense.

Whatever may be the merits of the issue discussed there, which concerns the level of the State\'s burden of proof in showing that respondent had waived his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), that issue was neither raised nor briefed by the parties, and, in my view, it is not necessary to the decision.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Respondent made incriminatory statements both before and after he was handcuffed and taken into custody.  The only question presented by the Colorado District Attorney in his certiorari petition concerned the admissibility of respondent\'s precustodial statements.  Pet. for Cert. i, 14-15. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 479 U. S. 172</a></p><p> agree with the State of Colorado that the United States Constitution does not require suppression of those statements, but, in reaching that conclusion, unlike the Court, I am perfectly willing to accept the state trial court\'s finding that the statements were involuntary.</p>\n<p>The state trial court found that, in view of the "overwhelming evidence presented by the Defense," the prosecution did not meet its burden of demonstrating that respondent\'s initial statements to Officer Anderson were voluntary.  App. 47-48.  Nevertheless, in my opinion, the use of these involuntary precustodial statements does not violate the Fifth Amendment, because they were not the product of state compulsion.  Although they may well be so unreliable that they could not support a conviction, at this stage of the proceeding, I could not say that they have no probative force whatever.  The fact that the statements were involuntary -- just as the product of Lady Macbeth\'s nightmare was involuntary [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] -- does not mean that their use for whatever evidentiary value they may have is fundamentally unfair or a denial of due process.</p>\n<p>The post-custodial statements raise an entirely distinct question.  When the officer whom respondent approached elected to handcuff him and to take him into custody, the police assumed a fundamentally different relationship with him.  Prior to that moment, the police had no duty to give respondent <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and had every right to continue their exploratory conversation with him. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Once the custodial relationship was established, however, the questioning assumed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 479 U.

In my opinion, the questioning could not thereafter go forward in the absence of a valid waiver of respondent\'s constitutional rights unless he was provided with counsel.  Since it is undisputed that respondent was not then competent to stand trial, I would also conclude that he was not competent to waive his constitutional right to remain silent. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court seems to believe that a waiver can be voluntary even if it is not the product of an exercise of the defendant\'s "<em>free will.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/case.html#169">479 U.

In <em>Townsend,</em> we overturned a murder conviction because the defendant\'s conviction was determined to be involuntary.  The defendant suffered from stomach pains induced by heroin withdrawal.  The police properly contacted a physician, who administered medications alleviating the withdrawal symptoms.  The defendant then confessed.  372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html#298">372 U. S. 298</a></span>.  Although the physician denied that he purposely administered "truth serum," there was an indication that the medications could have had such a side effect upon a narcotic addict.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/293/case.html#302">372 U.

And the <em>Townsend</em> Court expressly stated that police wrongdoing was not an essential factor:</p>\n<p>"It is not significant that the drug may have been administered and the questions asked by persons unfamiliar with hyoscine\'s properties as a \'truth serum,\' if these properties exist.  Any questioning by police officers which <em>in fact</em> produces a confession which is not the product of a free intellect renders that confession inadmissible.

The Court in <em>Townsend</em> stated:</p>\n<p>"[I]n <em>Blackburn v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/361/199/case.html">361 U.

Thus, the <em>Townsend</em> Court interpreted <em>Blackburn</em> as a case involving a confession by a mentally ill defendant in which the police harbored no improper purpose.</p>\n<p>This Court abandons this precedent in favor of the view that only confessions rendered involuntary by some state action are inadmissible, and that the only relevant form of state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 479 U.

The Colorado Supreme Court held that the trial court\'s admission of the involuntary confession into evidence is also state action.  The state court\'s analysis is consistent with <em>Brown v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/278/case.html">297 U.

Such a criticism, however, ignores the fact that we have traditionally examined the totality of the circumstances, including the motivation and competence of the defendant, in determining whether a confession is voluntary.

The Court\'s holding that involuntary confessions are only those procured through police misconduct is thus inconsistent with the Court\'s historical insistence that only confessions reflecting an exercise of free will be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Since the Court redefines voluntary confessions to include confessions by mentally ill individuals, the reliability of these confessions becomes a central concern.  A concern for reliability is inherent in our criminal justice system, which relies upon accusatorial, rather than inquisitorial, practices.

S. 183</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The instant case starkly highlights the danger of admitting a confession by a person with a severe mental illness.  The trial court made no findings concerning the reliability of Mr. Connelly\'s involuntary confession, since it believed that the confession was excludable on the basis of involuntariness.  However, the overwhelming evidence in the record points to the unreliability of Mr. Connelly\'s delusional mind.  Mr. Connelly was found incompetent to stand trial because he was unable to relate accurate information, and the court-appointed psychiatrist indicated that Mr. Connelly was actively hallucinating and exhibited delusional thinking at the time of his confession.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/case.html#174">479 U.

The Court, in fact, concedes that "[a] statement rendered by one in the condition of respondent might be proved to be quite unreliable. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/case.html#167">479 U. S. 167</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the record is barren of any corroboration of the mentally ill defendant\'s confession.  No physical evidence links the defendant to the alleged crime.  Police did not identify the alleged victim\'s body as the woman named by the defendant.  Mr. Connelly identified the alleged scene of the crime, but it has not been verified that the unidentified body was found there or that a crime actually occurred there.  There is not a shred of competent evidence in this record linking the defendant to the charged homicide.  There is only Mr. Connelly\'s confession.</p>\n<p>Minimum standards of due process should require that the trial court find substantial indicia of reliability, on the basis of evidence extrinsic to the confession itself, before admitting the confession of a mentally in person into evidence.  I would require the trial court to make such a finding on remand.  To hold otherwise allows the State to imprison and possibly to execute a mentally ill defendant based solely upon an inherently unreliable confession.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court inappropriately reaches out to address two <em>Miranda</em> issues not raised by the prosecutor in his petition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 479 U.

S. 482</a></span>-486.  Second, the four Justices constituting the majority in <em>Lego</em> rejected the petitioner\'s argument that proof beyond reasonable doubt would best serve the constitutional values that the exclusionary rule was meant to protect.  The four again emphasized that reliability of evidence was not a concern, since all involuntary confessions were excluded.  It found no evidence that federal rights had suffered by imposing the weakest standard of proof for exclusionary rules.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/477/case.html#487">404 U. S. 487</a></span>-489.</p>\n<p>I adhere to my <em>Lego</em> dissent.  The constitutional ideal that involuntary confessions should never be admitted against the defendant in criminal cases deserves protection by the highest standard of proof -- proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/477/case.html#491">404 U. S. 491</a></span>.  The lower standard of proof results</p>\n<p>"in the admission of more involuntary confessions than would be admitted were the prosecution required to meet a higher standard."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/477/case.html#493">404 U.

S. 494</a></span>.</p>\n<p>But even if the four Justices in <em>Lego</em> were correct, their holding is irrelevant to this case.  The presumption underlying the reasoning in <em>Lego</em> was that reliability was not an important concern, because involuntary confessions were always excluded.  Today the Court redefines voluntariness so that involuntary confessions that are not the result of police wrongdoing are no longer excluded under the voluntariness standard.  My analysis in Part II-B shows that reliability should now become a major concern in the admission of such confessions.  Since the reliability of verdicts is at stake, proof beyond a reasonable doubt constitutes the appropriate standard. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 479 U. S. 187</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Lego</em> involved a situation in which the defendant was not in custody.  By contrast, a <em>Miranda</em> waiver is found while a defendant is in police custody.  The coercive custodial interrogation atmosphere poses an increased danger of police overreaching.  The police establish the isolated conditions of custody, and can document the voluntary waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights through disinterested witnesses or recordings.  <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#475">384 U. S. 475</a></span>.  It is therefore appropriate to place a higher burden of proof on the government in establishing a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights.</p>\n<p>The ultimate irony is that, even accepting the preponderance of the evidence as the correct standard, the prosecution still failed to meet this burden of proof.  The Colorado Supreme Court found that Dr. Metzner, the court-appointed psychiatrist and the only expert to testify, "clearly established" that Mr. Connelly "was incapable" of making a "free decision" respecting his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  702 P.2d at 729.  Thus, the prosecution failed -- even by the modest standard imposed today -- to prove that Mr. Connelly voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court imports its voluntariness analysis, which makes police coercion a requirement for a finding of involuntariness, into its evaluation of the waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights.  My reasoning in Part II-A, <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/case.html#176">479 U. S. 176</a></span>-181, applies <em>a fortiori</em> to involuntary confessions made in custody involving the waiver of constitutional rights.  <em>See also Miranda v. Arizona, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#460">384 U. S. 460</a></span>.  I will not repeat here what I said there.</p>\n<p>I turn then to the second requirement, apart from the voluntariness requirement, that the State must satisfy to establish a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Besides being voluntary, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 479 U. S. 188</a></p><p> the waiver must be knowing and intelligent.  <em>See Moran v. Burbine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html">475 U. S. 412</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/case.html#421">475 U. S. 421</a></span> (1986).  We recently noted that</p>\n<p>"the waiver must have been made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The two requirements are independent:</p>\n<p>"Only if the \'totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\' reveals <em>both</em> an uncoerced choice <em>and</em> the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda</em> rights have been waived."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Since the Colorado Supreme Court found that Mr. Connelly was "clearly" unable to make an "intelligent" decision, clearly its judgment should be affirmed.  The Court reverses the entire judgment, however, without explaining how a "mistaken view of voluntariness" could "taint" this independent justification for suppressing the custodial confession, but leaving the Colorado Supreme Court free on remand to reconsider other issues, not inconsistent with the Court\'s opinion.  Such would include, in my view, whether the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver was satisfied.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/case.html#171">479 U. S. 171</a></span>, n. 4.  Moreover, on the remand, today\'s holding does not, of course, preclude a contrary resolution of this case based upon the State\'s separate interpretation of its own Constitution.  <em>See South Dakota v.

After plenary review of the record, <em>see Miller v. Fenton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html">474 U.

Quite apart from finding the <em>Miranda</em> waiver involuntary, the Colorado Supreme Court found that it was not an intelligent and knowing decision.
