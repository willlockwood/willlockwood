V. GENENTECH, INC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">MEDIMMUNE, INC. <em>v</em>. GENENTECH, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x93608.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 4, 2006\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 9, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">After the parties entered into a patent license agreement covering, <em>inter alia</em>, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 then-pending patent application, the application matured into the \xe2\x80\x9cCabilly II\xe2\x80\x9d patent.  Respondent Genentech, Inc., sent petitioner a letter stating that Synagis, a drug petitioner manufactured, was covered by the Cabilly II patent and that petitioner owed royalties under the agreement.  Although petitioner believed no royalties were due because the patent was invalid and unenforceable and because Synagis did not infringe the patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims, petitioner considered the letter a clear threat to enforce the patent, terminate the license agreement, and bring a patent infringement action if petitioner did not pay.  Because such an action could have resulted in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s being ordered to pay treble damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and enjoined from selling Synagis, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its sales revenue, petitioner paid the royalties under protest and filed this action for declaratory and other relief.  The District Court dismissed the declaratory-judgment claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because, under Federal Circuit precedent, a patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an Article III case or controversy with regard to the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity, enforceability, or scope.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that only a freestanding patent-invalidity claim is at issue, the record establishes that petitioner has raised and preserved the contract claim that, because of patent invalidity, unenforceability, and noninfringement, no royalties are owing.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.  The Federal Circuit erred in affirming the dismissal of this action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The standards for determining whether a particular declaratory-judgment action satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>\xe2\x80\x9cwhether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant\xe2\x80\x9d relief, <em>Maryland Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/270/index.html">312 U. S. 270</a>, 273\xe2\x80\x94are satisfied here even though petitioner did not refuse to make royalty payments under the license agreement.  Where threatened <em>government</em> action is concerned, a plaintiff is not required to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat.  His own action (or inaction) in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution, but nonetheless does not eliminate Article III jurisdiction because the threat-eliminating behavior was effectively coerced.  Similarly, where the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s self-avoidance of imminent injury is coerced by the threatened enforcement action of <em>a private party </em>rather than the government, lower federal and state courts have long accepted jurisdiction.  In its only decision in point, this Court held that a licensee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cease its royalty payments did not render nonjusticiable a dispute over the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity.  <em>Altvater</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/359/index.html">319 U. S. 359</a>, 364.  Though <em>Altvater</em> involved an injunction, it acknowledged that the licensees had the option of stopping payments in defiance of the injunction, but that the <em>consequence</em> of doing so would be to risk \xe2\x80\x9cactual [and] treble damages in infringement suits\xe2\x80\x9d by the patentees, a consequence also threatened in this case.  <em>Id.,</em> at 365.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that the parties in effect settled this dispute when they entered into their license agreement is mistaken.  Their appeal to the common-law rule that a party to a contract cannot both challenge its validity and continue to reap its benefits is also unpersuasive.  Lastly, because it was raised for the first time here, this Court does not decide respondents\xe2\x80\x99 request to affirm the dismissal of the declaratory-judgment claims on discretionary grounds.  That question and any merits-based arguments for denial of declaratory relief are left for the lower courts on remand.

Petitioner MedImmune, Inc., manufactures Synagis, a drug used to prevent respiratory tract disease in infants and young children.  In 1997, petitioner entered into a patent license agreement with respondent Genentech, Inc. (which acted on behalf of itself as patent assignee and on behalf of the coassignee, respondent City of Hope).  The license covered an existing patent relating to the production of \xe2\x80\x9cchimeric antibodies\xe2\x80\x9d and a then-pending patent application relating to \xe2\x80\x9cthe coexpression of immunoglobulin chains in recombinant host cells.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner agreed to pay royalties on sales of \xe2\x80\x9cLicensed Products,\xe2\x80\x9d and respondents granted petitioner the right to make, use, and sell them.  The agreement defined \xe2\x80\x9cLicensed Products\xe2\x80\x9d as a specified antibody, \xe2\x80\x9cthe manufacture, use or sale of which \xe2\x80\xa6 would, if not licensed under th[e] Agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or both of [the covered patents,] which have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has been or may be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 399.  The license agreement gave petitioner the right to terminate upon six months\xe2\x80\x99 written notice.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2001, the \xe2\x80\x9ccoexpression\xe2\x80\x9d application covered by the 1997 license agreement matured into the \xe2\x80\x9cCabilly II\xe2\x80\x9d patent.  Soon thereafter, respondent Genentech delivered petitioner a letter expressing its belief that Synagis was covered by the Cabilly II patent and its expectation that petitioner would pay royalties beginning March 1, 2002.  Petitioner did not think royalties were owing, believing that the Cabilly II patent was invalid and unenforceable,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and that its claims were in any event not infringed by Synagis.  Nevertheless, petitioner considered the letter to be a clear threat to enforce the Cabilly II patent, terminate the 1997 license agreement, and sue for patent infringement if petitioner did not make royalty payments as demanded.  If respondents were to prevail in a patent infringement action, petitioner could be ordered to pay treble damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and could be enjoined from selling Synagis, a product that has accounted for more than 80 percent of its revenue from sales since 1999.  Unwilling to risk such serious consequences, petitioner paid the demanded royalties \xe2\x80\x9cunder protest and with reservation of all of [its] rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 426.  This declaratory-judgment action followed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner sought the declaratory relief discussed in detail in Part II below.  Petitioner also requested damages and an injunction with respect to other federal and state claims not relevant here.  The District Court granted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the declaratory-judgment claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, relying on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <em>Gen-Probe Inc.</em> v. <em>Vysis, Inc.</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 1376 (2004).  <em>Gen-Probe</em> had held that a patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an Article III case or controversy with regard to validity, enforceability, or scope of the patent because the license agreement \xe2\x80\x9cobliterate[s] any reasonable apprehension\xe2\x80\x9d that the licensee will be sued for infringement.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1381.  The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court, also relying on <em>Gen-Probe</em>.  427 F.\xc2\xa03d 958 (2005).  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/1169/index.html">546 U. S. 1169</a> (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, we address a disagreement concerning the nature of the dispute at issue here\xe2\x80\x94whether it involves only a freestanding claim of patent invalidity or rather a claim that, both because of patent invalidity and because of noninfringement, no royalties are owing under the license agreement.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That probably makes no difference to the ultimate issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, but it is well to be clear about the nature of the case before us.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cis not seeking an interpretation of its present contractual obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Genentech 37; see also Brief for Respondent City of Hope 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  They claim this for two reasons: (1) because there is no dispute that Synagis infringes the Cabilly II patent, thereby making royalties payable; and (2) because while there is a dispute over patent validity, the contract calls for royalties on an infringing product whether or not the underlying patent is valid.  See Brief for Respondent Genentech 7, 37.  The first point simply does not comport with the allegations of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint.  The very first count requested a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ON CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cdisputes its obligation to make payments under the 1997 License Agreement because [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] sale of its Synagis<font super="1">\xc2\xae product does not infringe any valid claim of the [Cabilly II] Patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 136.  These contentions were repeated throughout the complaint.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104, 105, 108, 147.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not infringe any <em>valid </em>claim\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) cannot be thought to be no more than a challenge to the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity, since elsewhere the amended complaint states with unmistakable clarity that \xe2\x80\x9cthe patent is \xe2\x80\xa6 not infringed by [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] Synagis product and that [petitioner] owes no payments under license agreements with [respondents].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 104.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second point, petitioner assuredly did contend that it had no obligation under the license to pay royalties on an invalid patent.  <em>Id.</em>, at 104, 136, 147.  Nor is that contention frivolous.  True, the license requires petitioner to pay royalties <em>until</em> a patent claim has been held invalid by a competent body, and the Cabilly II patent has not.  But the license at issue in <em>Lear, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/653/index.html">395 U. S. 653</a>, 673 (1969), similarly provided that \xe2\x80\x9croyalties are to be paid until such time as the \xe2\x80\x98patent \xe2\x80\xa6 is held invalid,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and we rejected the argument that a repudiating licensee must comply with its contract and pay royalties until its claim is vindicated in court.  We express no opinion on whether a <em>nonrepudiating licensee</em> is similarly relieved of its contract obligation during a successful challenge to a patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity\xe2\x80\x94that is, on the applicability of licensee estoppel under these circumstances.  Cf. <em>Studiengesellschaft Kohle, M.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0H.</em> v. <em>Shell Oil Co.</em>, 112 F.\xc2\xa03d 1561, 1568 (CA Fed. 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] licensee \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot invoke the protection of the <em>Lear</em> doctrine until it (i) actually ceases payment of royalties, and (ii) provides notice to the licensor that the reason for ceasing payment of royalties is because it has deemed the relevant claims to be invalid\xe2\x80\x9d).  All we need determine is whether petitioner has alleged a contractual dispute.  It has done so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents further argue that petitioner waived its contract claim by failing to argue it below.  Brief for Respondent Genentech 10\xe2\x80\x9311; Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  The record reveals, however, that petitioner raised the contract point before the Federal Circuit.  See Brief for Plantiff-Appellant MedImmune, Inc. in Nos. 04\xe2\x80\x931300, 04\xe2\x80\x931384 (CA Fed.), p.\xc2\xa038 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, MedImmune is seeking to define its rights and obligations under its contract with Genentech\xe2\x80\x94precisely the type of action the Declaratory Judgment Act contemplates\xe2\x80\x9d).  That petitioner limited its contract argument to a few pages of its appellate brief does not suggest a waiver; it merely reflects counsel\xe2\x80\x99s sound assessment that the argument would be futile.  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Gen-Probe</em> precedent precluded jurisdiction over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contract claims, and the panel below had no authority to overrule <em>Gen-Probe</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Having determined that petitioner has raised and preserved a contract claim,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] we turn to the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 any court of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72201(a).  There was a time when this Court harbored doubts about the compatibility of declaratory-judgment actions with Article III\xe2\x80\x99s case-or-controversy requirement.  See <em>Willing</em> v. <em>Chicago Auditorium Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/274/index.html"></a><a href="/us/277/274/index.html">277 U. S. 274</a>, 289 (1928); <em>Liberty Warehouse Co.</em> v. <em>Grannis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/273/70/index.html">273 U. S. 70</a> (1927); see also <em>Gordon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 117 U. S. Appx. 697, 702 (1864) (the last opinion of Taney, C.\xc2\xa0J., published posthumously) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe award of execution is \xe2\x80\xa6 an essential part of every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d).  We dispelled those doubts, however, in <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Wallace</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/288/249/index.html">288 U. S. 249</a> (1933), holding (in a case involving a declaratory judgment rendered in state court) that an appropriate action for declaratory relief <em>can</em> be a case or controversy under Article III.  The federal Declaratory Judgment Act was signed into law the following year, and we upheld its constitutionality in <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Haworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/index.html"></a><a href="/us/300/227/index.html">300 U. S. 227</a> (1937).  Our opinion explained that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccase of actual controversy\xe2\x80\x9d in the Act refers to the type of \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies\xe2\x80\x9d that are justiciable under Article III.  <em>Id.,</em> at 240.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Aetna</em> and the cases following it do not draw the brightest of lines between those declaratory-judgment actions that satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement and those that do not.  Our decisions have required that the dispute be \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests\xe2\x80\x9d; and that it be \xe2\x80\x9creal and substantial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadmi[t] of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 240\xe2\x80\x93241.  In <em>Maryland Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/270/index.html"></a><a href="/us/312/270/index.html">312 U. S. 270</a>, 273 (1941), we summarized as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that these standards would have been satisfied if petitioner had taken the final step of refusing to make royalty payments under the 1997 license agreement.  Respondents claim a right to royalties under the licensing agreement.  Petitioner asserts that no royalties are owing because the Cabilly II patent is invalid and not infringed; and alleges (without contradiction) a threat by respondents to enjoin sales if royalties are not forthcoming.  The factual and legal dimensions of the dispute are well defined and, but for petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to make royalty payments, nothing about the dispute would render it unfit for judicial resolution.  Assuming (without deciding) that respondents here could not claim an anticipatory breach and repudiate the license, the continuation of royalty payments makes what would otherwise be an imminent threat at least remote, if not nonexistent.  As long as those payments are made, there is no risk that respondents will seek to enjoin petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sales.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own acts, in other words, eliminate the imminent threat of harm.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The question before us is whether this causes the dispute no longer to be a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis must begin with the recognition that, where threatened action by <em>government</em> is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat\xe2\x80\x94for example, the constitutionality of a law threatened to be enforced.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s own action (or inaction) in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution, but nonetheless does not eliminate Article III jurisdiction.  For example, in <em>Terrace</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/263/197/index.html">263 U. S. 197</a> (1923), the State threatened the plaintiff with forfeiture of his farm, fines, and penalties if he entered into a lease with an alien in violation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s anti-alien land law.  Given this genuine threat of enforcement, we did not require, as a prerequisite to testing the validity of the law in a suit for injunction, that the plaintiff bet the farm, so to speak, by taking the violative action.  <em>Id.,</em> at 216.  See also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Village of Euclid</em> v. <em>Ambler Realty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/index.html">272 U. S. 365</a> (1926); <em>Ex parte Young</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/index.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908).  Likewise, in <em>Steffel</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/452/index.html">415 U. S. 452</a> (1974), we did not require the plaintiff to proceed to distribute handbills and risk actual prosecution before he could seek a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of a state statute prohibiting such distribution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 458\xe2\x80\x93460.  As then-Justice Rehnquist put it in his concurrence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe declaratory judgment procedure is an alternative to pursuit of the arguably illegal activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 480.  In each of these cases, the plaintiff had eliminated the imminent threat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do (enter into a lease, or distribute handbills at the shopping center).  That did not preclude subject-matter jurisdiction because the threat-eliminating behavior was effectively coerced.  See <em>Terrace</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 215\xe2\x80\x93216; <em>Steffel</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 459.  The dilemma posed by that coercion\xe2\x80\x94putting the challenger to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking prosecution\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9ca dilemma that it was the very purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to ameliorate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/387/136/index.html">387 U. S. 136</a>, 152 (1967).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Supreme Court jurisprudence is more rare regarding application of the Declaratory Judgment Act to situations in which the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s self-avoidance of imminent injury is coerced by threatened enforcement action of <em>a private party </em>rather than the government.  Lower federal courts, however (and state courts interpreting declaratory judgment Acts requiring \xe2\x80\x9cactual controversy\xe2\x80\x9d), have long accepted jurisdiction in such cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Keener Oil &amp; Gas Co.</em> v. <em>Consolidated Gas Utilities Corp.</em>, 190 F.\xc2\xa02d 985, 989 (CA10 1951); <em>American Machine &amp; Metals, Inc.</em> v. <em>De Bothezat Impeller Co.</em>, 166 F.\xc2\xa02d 535 (CA2 1948); <em>Hess</em> v. <em>Country Club Park</em>, 213 Cal. 613, 614, 2 P.\xc2\xa02d 782, 783 (1931) (in bank); <em>Washington-Detroit Theater Co.</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 249 Mich. 673, 675, 229 N.\xc2\xa0W. 618, 618\xe2\x80\x93619 (1930); see also Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Note on Fed.

S. 359</a> (1943), held that a licensee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cease its payment of royalties did not render nonjusticiable a dispute over the validity of the patent.  In that litigation, several patentees had sued their licensees to enforce territorial restrictions in the license.  The licensees filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that the underlying patents were invalid, in the meantime paying \xe2\x80\x9cunder protest\xe2\x80\x9d royalties required by an injunction the patentees had obtained in an earlier case.  The patentees argued that \xe2\x80\x9cso long as [licensees] continue to pay royalties, there is only an academic, not a real controversy, between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 364.  We rejected that argument and held that the declaratory-judgment claim presented a justiciable case or controversy: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that royalties were being paid did not make this a \xe2\x80\x98difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Aetna</em>, 300 U. S., at 240).  The royalties \xe2\x80\x9cwere being paid under protest and under the compulsion of an injunction decree,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless the injunction decree were modified, the only other course [of action] was to defy it, and to risk not only actual but treble damages in infringement suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 U. S., at 365.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe requirements of [a] case or controversy are met where payment of a claim is demanded as of right and where payment is made, but where the involuntary or coercive nature of the exaction preserves the right to recover the sums paid or to challenge the legality of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Gen-Probe</em> decision distinguished <em>Altvater</em> on the ground that it<em> </em>involved the compulsion of an injunction.  But <em>Altvater</em> cannot be so readily dismissed.  Never mind that the injunction had been privately obtained and was ultimately within the control of the patentees, who could permit its modification.  More fundamentally, and contrary to the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, <em>Altvater</em> did not say that the coercion dispositive of the case was governmental, but suggested just the opposite.   The opinion acknowledged that the licensees had the option of stopping payments in defiance of the injunction, but explained that the <em>consequence</em> of doing so would be to risk \xe2\x80\x9cactual [and] treble damages in infringement suits\xe2\x80\x9d by the patentees.  319 U. S., at 365.  It significantly did not mention the threat of prosecution for contempt, or any other sort of governmental sanction.  Moreover, it cited approvingly a treatise which said that an \xe2\x80\x9cactual or threatened serious injury to business or employment\xe2\x80\x9d by a private party can be as coercive as other forms of coercion supporting restitution actions at common law; and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o imperil a man\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood, his business enterprises, or his solvency, [was] ordinarily quite as coercive\xe2\x80\x9d as, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cdetaining his property.\xe2\x80\x9d  F. Woodward, The Law of Quasi Contracts \xc2\xa7218 (1913), cited in <em>Altvater, supra, </em>at 365.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jurisdiction over the present case is not contradicted by <em>Willing</em> v. <em>Chicago Auditorium Association</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/274/index.html"></a><a href="/us/277/274/index.html">277 U. S. 274</a>.  There a ground lessee wanted to demolish an antiquated auditorium and replace it with a modern commercial building.  The lessee believed it had the right to do this without the lessors\xe2\x80\x99 consent, but was unwilling to drop the wrecking ball first and test its belief later.  Because there was no declaratory judgment act at the time under federal or applicable state law, the lessee filed an action to remove a \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d on its lease.  This Court held that an Article III case or controversy had not arisen because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o defendant ha[d] wronged the plaintiff or ha[d] threatened to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 288, 290.  It was true that one of the colessors had disagreed with the lessee\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the lease, but that happened in an \xe2\x80\x9cinformal, friendly, private conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 286, a year before the lawsuit was filed; and the lessee never even bothered to approach the other co-lessors.  The Court went on to remark that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat the plaintiff seeks is simply a declaratory judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o grant that relief is beyond the power conferred upon the federal judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 289.  Had <em>Willing</em> been decided after the enactment (and our upholding) of the Declaratory Judgment Act, and had the legal disagreement between the parties been as lively as this one, we are confident a different result would have obtained.  The rule that a plaintiff must destroy a large building, bet the farm, or (as here) risk treble damages and the loss of 80 percent of its business, before seeking a declaration of its actively contested legal rights finds no support in Article III.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents assert that the parties in effect settled this dispute when they entered into the 1997 license agreement.  When a licensee enters such an agreement, they contend, it essentially purchases an insurance policy, immunizing it from suits for infringement so long as it continues to pay royalties and does not challenge the covered patents.  Permitting it to challenge the validity of the patent without terminating or breaking the agreement alters the deal, allowing the licensee to continue enjoying its immunity while bringing a suit, the elimination of which was part of the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>quid pro quo.  </em>Of course even if it were valid, this argument would have no force with regard to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the agreement does not call for royalties because their product does not infringe the patent.  But even as to the patent invalidity claim, the point seems to us mistaken.  To begin with, it is not clear where the prohibition against challenging the validity of the patents is to be found.  It can hardly be implied from the mere promise to pay royalties on patents \xe2\x80\x9cwhich have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has been or may be taken,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 399.  Promising to pay royalties on patents that have not been held invalid does not amount to a promise <em>not to seek </em>a holding of their invalidity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents appeal to the common-law rule that a party to a contract cannot at one and the same time challenge its validity and continue to reap its benefits, citing <em>Commodity Credit Corp. </em>v.<em> Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co.</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa02d 504, 512 (CA9 1957), and <em>Kingman &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Stoddard</em>, 85 F. 740, 745 (CA7 1898)<em>.  Lear, </em>they contend, did not suspend that rule for patent licensing agreements, since the plaintiff in that case had already repudiated the contract.  Even if <em>Lear\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>repudiation of the doctrine of licensee estoppel was so limited (a point on which, as we have said earlier, we do not opine), it is hard to see how the common-law rule has any application here.  Petitioner is not repudiating or impugning the contract while continuing to reap its benefits.  Rather, it is asserting that the contract, properly interpreted, does not prevent it from challenging the patents, and does not require the payment of royalties because the patents do not cover its products and are invalid.  Of course even if respondents were correct that the licensing agreement or the common-law rule precludes this suit, the consequence would be that respondents win this case <em>on the merits</em>\xe2\x80\x94<em>not </em>that the very genuine contract dispute disappears, so that Article III jurisdiction is somehow defeated.  In short, Article III jurisdiction has nothing to do with this \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance-policy\xe2\x80\x9d contention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lastly, respondents urge us to affirm the dismissal of the declaratory-judgment claims on discretionary grounds.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that a court \xe2\x80\x9c<em>may</em> declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party,\xe2\x80\x9d 28  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72201(a) (emphasis added), not that it <em>must</em> do so.

We have found it \xe2\x80\x9cmore consistent with the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cto vest district courts with discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on the usefulness of the declaratory judgment remedy, and the fitness of the case for resolution, are peculiarly within their grasp.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilton, supra,</em> at 289.  The District Court here gave no consideration to discretionary dismissal, since, despite its \xe2\x80\x9cserious misgivings\xe2\x80\x9d about the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule, it considered itself bound to dismiss by <em>Gen-Probe</em>.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a.  Discretionary dismissal was irrelevant to the Federal Circuit for the same reason.  Respondents have raised the issue for the first time before this Court, exchanging competing accusations of inequitable conduct with petitioner.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondent Genentech 42\xe2\x80\x9344; Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, and n.\xc2\xa015.  Under these circumstances, it would be imprudent for us to decide whether the District Court should, or must, decline to issue the requested declaratory relief.  We leave the equitable, prudential, and policy arguments in favor of such a discretionary dismissal for the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 consideration on remand.

There, a patent owner sued to enjoin his licensee from paying accrued royalties to the Government under the Royalty Adjustment Act of 1942, and sought to attack the constitutionality of the Act.  The Court held the request for declaratory judgment and injunction nonjusticiable because the patent owner asserted no right to recover the royalties and there was no indication that the licensee would even raise the Act as a defense to suit for the royalties.

Here is the full quotation:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe District Court [in <em>Electrical Fittings</em>] adjudged a claim of a patent valid although it dismissed the bill for failure to prove infringement. We held that the finding of validity was immaterial to the disposition of the cause and that the winning party might appeal to obtain a reformation of the decree.  To hold a patent valid if it is not infringed is to decide a hypothetical case.  But the situation in the present case is quite different.  We have here not only bill and answer but a counterclaim.  Though the decision of non-infringement disposes of the bill and answer, it does not dispose of the counterclaim which raises the question of validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Altvater</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 363 (footnote\nomitted).</p>\n<p>\n\nAs the full quotation makes clear, the snippet quoted by the dissent has nothing to do with whether infringement must be actual or merely threatened.  Indeed, it makes clear that in appropriate cases to hold a noninfringed patent valid is <em>not </em>to decide a hypothetical case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the dissent acknowledges the central lesson of <em>Altvater, post, </em>at 8\xe2\x80\x94that payment of royalties under \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances does not eliminate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94it attempts to limit that rationale to the particular facts of <em>Altvater</em>.  But none of <em>Altvater</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunique facts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8, suggests that a different test applies to the royalty payments here.  Other than a conclusory assertion that the payments here were \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily made,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 10, the dissent never explains why the threat of treble damages and the loss of 80 percent of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s business does not fall within <em>Altvater</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>coercion rationale.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even if <em>Altvater</em> could be distinguished as an \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction\xe2\x80\x9d case, it would still contradict the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable apprehension of suit\xe2\x80\x9d test (or, in its evolved form, the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable apprehension of <em>imminent</em> suit\xe2\x80\x9d test, <em>Teva Pharm.

S. C. \xc2\xa72201.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/1169/index.html">546 U. S. 1169</a> (2006).  The answer to that question is yes.  We have consistently held that parties do not have standing to obtain rulings on matters that remain hypothetical or conjectural.  We have also held that the declaratory judgment procedure cannot be used to obtain advanced rulings on matters that would be addressed in a future case of actual controversy.  MedImmune has sought a declaratory judgment for precisely that purpose, and I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding that there is no Article III jurisdiction over MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The Court reaches the opposite result by extending the holding of <em>Steffel</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/452/index.html">415 U. S. 452</a> (1974), to private contractual obligations.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power to the adjudication of \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.  We have held that the Declaratory Judgment Act extends \xe2\x80\x9cto controversies which are such in the constitutional sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Haworth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/index.html">300 U. S. 227</a>, 240 (1937).  In the context of declaratory judgment actions, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have provided a uniform framework for assessing whether an Article III case or controversy exists.  In the constitutional sense, a \xe2\x80\x9cControversy\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alaska S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/253/113/index.html">253 U. S. 113</a>, 116 (1920)).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  300 U. S., at 240\xe2\x80\x93241.  Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t must be a real and substantial controversy\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 241.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Declaratory Judgment Act did not (and could not) alter the constitutional definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccase or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d or relax Article III\xe2\x80\x99s command that an actual case or controversy exist before federal courts may adjudicate a question.  See <em>Maryland Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/270/index.html">312 U. S. 270</a>, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (1941).  Thus, this Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Life Ins.</em>, 300 U. S.,<em> </em>at 240<em>.  </em>In other words, the Act merely provides a different procedure for bringing an actual case or controversy before a federal court.  The Court applied that principle in <em>Aetna Life Ins.</em>, where an insurance company brought a declaratory judgment action against an insured who claimed he had become disabled, had formally presented his claims, and had refused to make any more insurance payments.  <em>Id.,</em> at 242.  In the course of deciding that it could entertain the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s declaratory judgment action, the Court specifically noted that, had the insured filed his traditional cause of action first, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would have been no question that the controversy was of a justiciable nature\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 243.  Accordingly, the Act merely provided a different procedural tool that allowed the insurance company to bring an otherwise justiciable controversy before a federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have also held that no controversy exists when a declaratory judgment plaintiff attempts to obtain a premature ruling on potential defenses that would typically be adjudicated in a later actual controversy.  In <em>Coffman</em> v. <em>Breeze Corps.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/316/index.html">323 U. S. 316</a> (1945), a patent owner brought a declaratory judgment action against his licensees seeking to have the Royalty Adjustment Act of 1942 declared unconstitutional and to enjoin his licensees from paying accrued royalties to the Government.  This Court held that no case or controversy existed because the validity of the Royalty Adjustment Act would properly arise only as a defense in a suit by the patentholder against the licensees to recover royalties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 323\xe2\x80\x93324.  Accordingly, the complaint at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cbut a request for an advisory opinion as to the validity of a defense to a suit for recovery of the royalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 324.  And the Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he declaratory judgment procedure \xe2\x80\xa6 may not be made the medium for securing an advisory opinion in a controversy which has not arisen.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Calderon</em> v. <em>Ashmus</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/740/index.html">523 U. S. 740</a>, 747 (1998) (holding that a prisoner may not use a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of a defense that a State might raise in a future habeas proceeding).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles apply with equal force in the patent licensing context.  In <em>Altvater</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/359/index.html">319 U. S. 359</a>, 365\xe2\x80\x93366 (1943), the Court, quite unremarkably, held that a \xe2\x80\x9clicensee\xe2\x80\x9d had standing to bring a declaratory judgment counterclaim asserting the affirmative defense of patent invalidity in response to a patent infringement suit.  But not to be mistaken, the <em>Altvater</em> Court expressly stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o hold a patent valid if it is not infringed is to decide a hypothetical case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 363.  So too, in <em>Cardinal Chemical Co.</em> v. <em>Morton Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/508/83/index.html">508 U. S. 83</a>, 86 (1993), the affirmative defense of patent invalidity was raised as a counterclaim to a patent infringement suit.  Although we held that a finding of noninfringement on appeal did not moot a counterclaim alleging invalidity, <em>id.,</em> at 102\xe2\x80\x93103, we stated that our holding was limited to the jurisdiction of an appellate court and reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the trial court, of course, a party seeking a declaratory judgment has the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 95.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against the foregoing background, the case before us is not a justiciable case or controversy under Article III.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a threshold matter, I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of this case as including a \xe2\x80\x9ccontractual dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  To substantiate this characterization, the Court points to a three-paragraph count in MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s complaint entitled \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ON CONTACTUAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s broad allegations that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98its Synagis<font super="1">\xc2\xae product does not infringe any valid claim of the [Cabilly II] Patent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 4<em>.</em>  Nowhere in its complaint did MedImmune state why \xe2\x80\x9csale[s] of its Synagis<font super="1">\xc2\xae product\nd[o] not infringe any valid claim of the [Cabilly II] Patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 136.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Given the lack of specificity in the complaint, it is hardly surprising that the Court never explains what the supposed contract dispute is actually about.  A fair reading of the amended complaint (and a review of the litigation thus far) shows that MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontract count\xe2\x80\x9d simply posits that because the patent is invalid and unenforceable (as alleged in counts II and III), MedImmune is not bound by its contractual obligations.  As the Court admits, \xe2\x80\x9cthe license requires [MedImmune] to pay royalties <em>until</em> a patent claim has been held invalid by a competent body\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (emphasis in original).  Thus, even assuming the existence of a cognizable contract claim, the validity of that claim hinges entirely upon a determination of the patent\xe2\x80\x99s validity, independent of any contractual question.  As such, MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontract claim\xe2\x80\x9d simply repackages its patent invalidity claim.</font></font></f></p><font super="1"><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Probably for this reason, MedImmune has not pursued a contract claim at any level of the litigation.  The District Court stated that the product that was the subject of the license, Synagis, was \xe2\x80\x9ccovered by the patents at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 349\xe2\x80\x93350, and MedImmune has never challenged that characterization.  The Federal Circuit decided this case on the sole ground that a licensee in good standing may not bring a declaratory judgment action to challenge the validity of the underlying patent without some threat or apprehension of a patent infringement suit.  See 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 958, 965 (2005).  The question MedImmune presented in its petition for certiorari, which we accepted without alteration, says nothing about a contract claim.  Neither does MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief allege a contractual dispute.  Even at oral argument, it was not MedImmune, but an <em>amicus</em>, that alleged there was a contract dispute at issue in this case.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 21\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, MedImmune did not \xe2\x80\x9crais[e] and preserv[e] a contract claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court states that its identification of a contract claim \xe2\x80\x9cprobably makes no difference to the ultimate\xe2\x80\x9d outcome of this case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  This may very well be true, if only because of the broad scope of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts before us present no case or controversy under Article III.  When MedImmune filed this declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the Cabilly II patent, it was under no threat of being sued by Genentech for patent infringement.  This was so because MedImmune was a licensee in good standing that had made all necessary royalty payments.  Thus, by voluntarily entering into and abiding by a license agreement with Genentech, MedImmune removed any threat of suit.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9 (stating the threat of suit was \xe2\x80\x9cremote, if not nonexistent\xe2\x80\x9d).  MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s actions in entering into and continuing to comply with the license agreement deprived Genentech of any cause of action against MedImmune.  Additionally, MedImmune had no cause of action against Genentech.  Patent invalidity is an affirmative defense to patent infringement, not a freestanding cause of action.  See 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7282(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  Therefore, here, the Declaratory Judgment Act must be something more than an alternative procedure for bringing on otherwise actual case or controversy before a federal court.  But see <em>Aetna Life Ins.</em>, 300 U. S., at 240 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because neither Genentech nor MedImmune had a cause of action, MedImmune\xe2\x80\x99s prayer for declaratory relief can be reasonably understood only as seeking an advisory opinion about an affirmative defense it might use in some future litigation.  MedImmune wants to know whether, if it decides to breach its license agreement with Genentech, and if Genentech sues it for patent infringement, it will have a successful affirmative defense.  Presumably, upon a favorable determination, MedImmune would then stop making royalty payments, knowing in advance that the federal courts stand behind its decision.  Yet as demonstrated above, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not allow federal courts to give advisory rulings on the potential success of an affirmative defense before a cause of action has even accrued.  <em>Calderon</em>, 523 U. S., at 747 (dismissing a suit that \xe2\x80\x9cattempt[ed] to gain a litigation advantage by obtaining an advance ruling on an affirmative defense\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Coffman</em>, 323 U. S., at 324 (rejecting use of the Declaratory Judgment Act as a \xe2\x80\x9cmedium for securing an advisory opinion in a controversy which has not arisen\xe2\x80\x9d).  MedImmune has therefore asked the courts to render \xe2\x80\x9can opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aetna Life Ins.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 241; see also <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Utah</em> v. <em>Wycoff Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/237/index.html">344 U. S. 237</a>, 244 (1952) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe disagreement must not be nebulous or contingent but must have taken on fixed and final shape\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  A federal court cannot, consistent with Article III, provide MedImmune with such an opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, as this Court has plainly stated in the context of a counterclaim declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of a patent, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o hold a patent valid if it is not infringed is to decide a hypothetical case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Altvater</em>, 319 U. S., at 363.  Of course, MedImmune presents exactly that case.  Based on a clear reading of our precedent, I would hold that this case presents no actual case or controversy.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To reach today\xe2\x80\x99s result, the Court misreads our precedent and expands the concept of coercion from <em>Steffel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/452/index.html">415 U. S. 452</a>, to reach voluntarily accepted contractual obligations between private parties.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court inappropriately relies on <em>Altvater</em>, which is inapplicable to this case for three reasons.  First, in <em>Altvater</em>, the affirmative defense of patent invalidity arose in a declaratory judgment motion filed as a counterclaim to a patent infringement suit.  See 319 U. S.<em>,</em> at 360.  Second, the opinion in <em>Altvater</em> proceeds on the understanding that no license existed.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals had already held that the underlying license had been terminated prior to the filing of the case.  <em>Id.,</em> at 365 (\xe2\x80\x9cRoyalties were being demanded and royalties were being paid.  But they were being paid \xe2\x80\xa6 under the compulsion of an injunction decree\xe2\x80\x9d).  Third, and related, though the one-time licensee continued to pay royalties, it did so under the compulsion of an injunction that had been entered in a prior case.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>Altvater</em> simply held that under the unique facts of that case, the Court of Appeals erred in considering the declaratory judgment counterclaim moot because the \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary or coercive nature of the exaction preserve[d] the right to recover the sums paid or to challenge the legality of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cardinal Chemical Co.</em> v. <em>Morton Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/508/83/index.html">508 U. S. 83</a> (1993), is similarly inapt here.  In that case, as in <em>Altvater</em>, the defendant raised the affirmative defense of patent invalidity in a counterclaim to a patent infringement suit.  508 U. S., at 86.  We specifically held that a finding of noninfringement on appeal did not moot a counterclaim alleging invalidity.  <em>Id.,</em> at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  But we stressed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he issue before us, therefore[,] concern[s] the jurisdiction of an intermediate appellate court\xe2\x80\x94not the jurisdiction of a trial \xe2\x80\xa6 court\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  In the trial court, of course, a party seeking a declaratory judgment has the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case or controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 95.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We went on to offer a hypothetical that showed a party could seek a declaratory judgment \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n patent litigation \xe2\x80\xa6 even if the patentee has not filed an infringement action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  However, that hypothetical involved a patent-holder that threatened an infringement suit against a competitor (<em>not</em> a licensee) that continued to sell the allegedly infringing product and faced growing liability.  In doing so, we hypothesized a situation that paralleled the facts in <em>Aetna Life Ins.:</em> The patentee had a cause of action against an alleged infringer and could have brought suit at any moment, and the declaratory judgment procedure simply offered the alleged infringer a different method of bringing an otherwise justiciable case or controversy into court.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s more serious error is its extension of <em>Steffel</em>, <em>supra</em>, to apply to voluntarily accepted contractual obligations between private parties.  No court has ever taken such a broad view of <em>Steffel</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Steffel</em>, the Court held that in certain limited circumstances, a party\xe2\x80\x99s anticipatory cause of action qualified as a case or controversy under Article III.  Based expressly on the coercive nature of governmental power, the Court found that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to <em>actual arrest</em> or <em>prosecution</em> to be entitled to challenge a <em>statute</em> that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 459 (emphasis added).  Limited, as it is, to governmental power, particularly the power of arrest and prosecution, <em>Steffel</em> says nothing about coercion in the context of private contractual obligations.  It is therefore not surprising that, until today, this Court has never applied <em>Steffel</em> and its theory of coercion to private contractual obligations; indeed, no court has ever done so.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority not only extends <em>Steffel</em> to cases that do not involve governmental coercion, but also extends <em>Steffel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  If \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d were understood as the Court used that term in <em>Steffel</em>, it would apply only if Genentech had threatened MedImmune with a patent infringement suit <em>in the absence of a license agreement</em>.  At that point, MedImmune would have had a choice, as did the declaratory plaintiff in <em>Steffel</em>, either to cease the otherwise protected activity (here, selling Synagis) or to continue in that activity and face the threat of a lawsuit.  But MedImmune faced no such choice.  Here, MedImmune could continue selling its product without threat of suit because it had eliminated any risk of suit by entering into a license agreement.  By holding that the voluntary choice to enter an agreement to avoid some other coerced choice is itself coerced, the Court goes far beyond <em>Steffel</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority explains that the \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive nature of the exaction preserves the right \xe2\x80\xa6 to challenge the legality of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The coercive nature of what \xe2\x80\x9cexaction\xe2\x80\x9d?  The answer has to be the voluntarily made license payments because there was no threat of suit here.  By holding that contractual obligations are sufficiently coercive to allow a party to bring a declaratory judgment action, the majority has given every patent licensee a cause of action and a free pass around Article\xc2\xa0III\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for challenging the validity of licensed patents.  But the reasoning of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion applies not just to patent validity suits.  Indeed, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion contains no limiting principle whatsoever, casting aside Justice Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that <em>Steffel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s use would \xe2\x80\x9cbe exceedingly rare.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U.

It addressed the propriety and extent of the common-law doctrine of licensee estoppel, and the licensee in <em>Lear </em>had ceased making payments under the license agreement\xe2\x80\x94a fact that makes the case singularly inapposite here.  <em>Id.,</em> at 659\xe2\x80\x93660.  <em>Lear</em> did not involve the Declaratory Judgment Act because the case was brought as a breach-of-contract action for failure to pay royalties.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Admitting that such decisions are \xe2\x80\x9crare,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9, the Court cites cases predating <em>Steffel</em> that hold that a court may construe contractual provisions prior to breach.  Those cases do not rely on the coercion inherent in making contractual payments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Keener Oil &amp; Gas Co.</em> v. <em>Consolidated Gas Util. Corp.</em>, 190 F.\xc2\xa02d 985, 989 (CA10 1951).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="1">\n</font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="1">\n</font></font></font></font></font></div>'
