JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and V, finding that:</p>\n<p>1. Appellee Population Planning Associates (PPA), a corporation that makes mail-order sales of nonmedical contraceptive devices from its North Carolina offices and regularly advertises its products in New York periodicals and fills mail orders from New York residents without limiting availability of the products to persons of any particular age, has the requisite standing to maintain the action not only in its own right but also on behalf of its potential customers, <em>Craig v.

Regulations imposing a burden on a decision as fundamental as whether to bear or beget a child may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.

The provision prohibiting distribution of nonmedical contraceptives to persons 16 or over except through licensed pharmacists clearly burdens the right of such individuals to use contraceptives if they so desire, and the provision serves no compelling state interests.  It cannot be justified by an interest in protecting health insofar as it applies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 431 U. S. 679</a></p><p> to nonhazardous contraceptives or in protecting potential life, nor can it be justified by a concern that young people not sell contraceptives, or as being designed to serve as a quality control device or as facilitating enforcement of the other provisions of the statute.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#686">431 U. S. 686</a></span>-691.</p>\n<p>4. The prohibition of any advertisement or display of contraceptives that seeks to suppress completely any information about the availability and price of contraceptives cannot be justified on the ground that advertisements of contraceptive products would offend and embarrass those exposed to them, and that permitting them would legitimize sexual activity of young people.  These are classically not justifications validating suppression of expression protected by the First Amendment, and here the advertisements in question merely state the availability of products that are not only entirely legal, but constitutionally protected.   Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#700">431 U. S. 700</a></span>-702.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part IV that the provision prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16, as applied to nonprescription contraceptives, cannot be justified as a permissible regulation of minors\' morality in furtherance of the State\'s policy against promiscuous sexual intercourse among the young.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#691">431 U. S. 691</a></span>-699.</p>\n<p>(a) The right to privacy in connection with decisions affecting procreation extends to minors as well as to adults, and since a State may not impose a blanket prohibition, or even a blanket requirement of parental consent, on the choice of a minor to terminate her pregnancy, <em>Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html">428 U. S. 52</a></span>, the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition of the distribution of contraceptives to minors is <em>a fortiori</em> foreclosed.

S. 693</a></span>-694.</p>\n<p>(b) The argument that sexual activity may be deterred by increasing the hazards attendant on it has been rejected by the Court as a justification for restrictions on the freedom to choose whether to bear or beget a child.  <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html">405 U. S. 438</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#448">405 U.

Moreover, there is substantial doubt whether limiting access to contraceptives will, in fact, substantially discourage early sexual behavior.  When a State, as here, burdens the exercise of a fundamental right, its attempt to justify that burden as a rational means for the accomplishment of some state policy requires more than the unsupported assertion (appellants here having conceded that there is no evidence that teenage extramarital sexual activity increases in proportion to the availability of contraceptives) that the burden is connected to such a policy.

JUSTICE POWELL concluded that the prohibition against distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16 is defective both because it infringes the privacy interests of married females between the ages of 14 and 16 and because it prohibits parents from distributing contraceptives to their children, thus unjustifiably interfering with parental interests in rearing children.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN Joined.</p>\n<p>Under New York Educ. Law $ 6811(8) (McKinney 1972), it is a crime (1) for any person to sell or distribute any contraceptive of any kind to a minor under the age of 16 years; (2) for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute contraceptives to persons 16 or over; and (3) for anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives.

We noted probable jurisdiction, 426 U.S. 918 (1976).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>We must address a preliminary question of the standing of the various appellees to maintain the action.  We conclude that appellee Population Planning Associates, Inc. (PPA) has the requisite standing, and therefore have no occasion to decide the standing of the other appellees. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>PPA is a corporation primarily engaged in the mail-order retail sale of nonmedical contraceptive devices from its offices in North Carolina.  PPA regularly advertises its products in periodicals published or circulated in New York, accepts orders from New York residents, and fills orders by mailing contraceptives to New York purchasers.  Neither the advertisements nor the order forms accompanying them limit availability of PPA\'s products to persons of any particular age.</p>\n<p>Various New York officials have advised PPA that its activities violate New York law. A letter of December 1, 1971, notified PPA that a PPA advertisement in a New York college newspaper violated $ 6811(8), citing each of the three challenged provisions, and requested "future compliance" with the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="683">Page 431 U. S. 683</a></p><p> law.  A second letter, dated February 23, 1973, notifying PPA that PPA\'s magazine advertisements of contraceptives violated the statute, referred particularly to the provisions prohibiting sales to minors and sales by nonpharmacists, and threatened:  "In the event you fail to comply, the matter will be referred to our Attorney General for legal action."  Finally, PPA was served with a copy of a report of inspectors of the State Board of Pharmacy, dated September 4, 1974, which recorded that PPA advertised male contraceptives, and had been advised to cease selling contraceptives in violation of the state law.</p>\n<p>That PPA has standing to challenge $ 6811(8) not only in its own right, but also on behalf of its potential customers, is settled by <em>Craig v.

In this case, as did the statute in <em>Craig,</em> \xc2\xa7 6811(8) inflicts on the vendor PPA "injury in fact" that satisfies Art.

That decision holds a particularly important place in the history of the right of privacy, a right first explicitly recognized in an opinion holding unconstitutional a statute prohibiting the use of contraceptives, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, supra,</em> and most prominently vindicated in recent years in the contexts of contraception, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra; and abortion, Roe v.

This is understandable, for in a field that, by definition, concerns the most intimate of human activities and relationships, decisions whether to accomplish or to prevent conception are among the most private and sensitive.</p>\n<p>"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free of unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."</p>\n<p><em>Eisenstadt v.

(Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p>That the constitutionally protected right of privacy extends to an individual\'s liberty to make choices regarding contraception does not, however, automatically invalidate every state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 431 U. S. 686</a></p><p> regulation in this area.  The business of manufacturing and selling contraceptives may be regulated in ways that do not infringe protected individual choices.  And even a burdensome regulation may be validated by a sufficiently compelling state interest.  In <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> for example, after determining that the "right of privacy . . . encompass[es] a woman\'s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy," 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#153">410 U. S. 153</a></span>, we cautioned that the right is not absolute, and that certain state interests (in that case, "interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life") may at some point "become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#154">410 U. S. 154</a></span>.  "Compelling" is of course the key word; where a decision as fundamental as that whether to bear or beget a child is involved, regulations imposing a burden on it may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#155">410 U.

They emphasize that <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em> struck down a state prohibition of the use of contraceptives, and so had no occasion to discuss laws "regulating their manufacture or sale."  381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#485">381 U. S. 485</a></span>.  <em>Eisenstadt v.

Thus appellants argue that neither case should be treated as reflecting upon the State\'s power to limit or prohibit distribution of contraceptives to any persons, married or unmarried.  <em>But see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#463">405 U.

This intrusion into "the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms" made that statute particularly "repulsive."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#485">381 U. S. 485</a></span>-486.  But subsequent decisions have made clear that the constitutional protection of individual autonomy in matters of childbearing is not dependent on that element.  <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</em> holding that the protection is not limited to married couples, characterized the protected right as the "<em>decision</em> whether to bear or beget a child."  405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#453">405 U. S. 453</a></span> (emphasis added).  Similarly, <em>Roe v. Wade</em> held that the Constitution protects "a woman\'s <em>decision</em> whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."  410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#153">410 U. S. 153</a></span> (emphasis added).  <em>See also Whalen v. Roe, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/case.html#599">429 U. S. 599</a></span>-600, and n. 26.  These decisions put <em>Griswold</em> in proper perspective.  <em>Griswold</em> may no longer be read as holding only that a State may not prohibit a married couple\'s use of contraceptives.  Read in light of its progeny, the teaching of <em>Griswold</em> is that the Constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing from unjustified intrusion by the State.</p>\n<p>Restrictions on the distribution of contraceptives clearly burden the freedom to make such decisions.  A total prohibition against sale of contraceptives, for example, would intrude </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 431 U. S. 688</a></p><p> upon individual decisions in matters of procreation and contraception as harshly as a direct ban on their use.  Indeed, in practice, a prohibition against all sales, since more easily and less offensively enforced, might have an even more devastating effect upon the freedom to choose contraception.  <em>Cf. Poe v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>An instructive analogy is found in decisions after <em>Roe v. Wade, supra,</em> that held unconstitutional statutes that did not prohibit abortions outright but limited in a variety of ways a woman\'s access to them.  <em>Doe v. Bolton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html">410 U. S. 179</a></span> (1973); <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v.

Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html">421 U. S. 809</a></span> (1975).  The significance of these cases is that they establish that the same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual\'s right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely.  Both types of regulation</p>\n<p>"may be justified only by a \'compelling state interest\' . . . , and . . . must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake."</p>\n<p><em>Roe v. Wade, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#155">410 U. S. 155</a></span>. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>See also Eisentadt v.

This is so not because there is an independent fundamental "right of access to contraceptives," but because such access is essential to exercise of the constitutionally protected right of decision in matters of childbearing that is the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 431 U. S. 689</a></p><p> underlying foundation of the holdings in <em>Griswold, Eisenstadt v. Baird,</em> and <em>Roe v. Wade.</em></p>\n<p>Limiting the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives to licensed pharmacists clearly imposes a significant burden on the right of the individuals to use contraceptives if they choose to do so.  <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#461">405 U. S. 461</a></span>-464 (WHITE, J., concurring in result).  The burden is, of course, not as great as that under a total ban on distribution.  Nevertheless, the restriction of distribution channels to a small fraction of the total number of possible retail outlets renders contraceptive devices considerably less accessible to the public, reduces the opportunity for privacy of selection and purchase, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and lessens the possibility of price competition. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Cf. Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#503">381 U. S. 503</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).  Of particular relevance here is <em>Doe v. Bolton, supra,</em> in which the Court struck down, as unconstitutionally burdening the right of a woman to choose abortion, a statute requiring that abortions be performed only in accredited hospitals, in the absence of proof that the requirement was substantially related to the State\'s interest in protecting the patient\'s health.  410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html#193">410 U. S. 193</a></span>-195.  The same infirmity infuses the limitation in \xc2\xa7 6811(8).</p>\n<p>"Just as in <em>Griswold,</em> where the right of married persons to use contraceptives was \'diluted or adversely affected\' by permitting a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 431 U. S. 690</a></p><p> conviction for giving advice as to its exercise, . . . so here, to sanction a medical restriction upon distribution of a contraceptive not proved hazardous to health would impair the exercise of the constitutional right."</p>\n<p><em>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</em> 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#464">405 U. S. 464</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in result).</p>\n<p>There remains the inquiry whether the provision serves a compelling state interest.  Clearly, "interests . . . in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life," <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#154">410 U. S. 154</a></span>, cannot be invoked to justify this statute.  Insofar as \xc2\xa7 6811(8) applies to nonhazardous contraceptives, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] it bears no relation to the State\'s interest in protecting health.  <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#450">450 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Nor is the interest in protecting potential life implicated in state regulation of contraceptives.  <em>Roe v. Wade, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163">410 U. S. 163</a></span>-164.</p>\n<p>Appellants therefore suggest that \xc2\xa7 6811(8) furthers other state interests.  But none of them is comparable to those the Court has heretofore recognized as compelling.  Appellants argue that the limitation of retail sales of nonmedical contraceptives to pharmacists (1) expresses "a proper concern that young people not sell contraceptives"; (2) "allows purchasers to inquire as to the relative qualities of the varying products and prevents anyone from tampering with them"; and (3) facilitates enforcement of the other provisions of the statute.  Brief for Appellants 14.  The first hardly can justify the statute\'s incursion into constitutionally protected rights, and, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 431 U. S. 691</a></p><p> in any event, the statute is obviously not substantially related to any goal of preventing young people from selling contraceptives. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Nor is the statute designed to serve as a quality control device.  Nothing in the record suggests that pharmacists are particularly qualified to give advice on the merits of different nonmedical contraceptives, or that such advice is more necessary to the purchaser of contraceptive products than to consumers of other nonprescription items.  Why pharmacists are better able or more inclined than other retailers to prevent tampering with prepackaged products, or, if they are, why contraceptives are singled out for this special protection, is also unexplained. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As to ease of enforcement, the prospect of additional administrative inconvenience has not been thought to justify invasion of fundamental constitutional rights.  <em>See, e.g., Morrssey v. Brewer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/471/case.html">408 U. S. 471</a></span> (1972); <em>Gloldberg v.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The argument is that minors\' sexual activity may be deterred by increasing the hazards attendant on it.  The same argument, however, would support a ban on abortions for minors, or indeed support a prohibition on abortions, or access to contraceptives, for the unmarried, whose sexual activity is also against the public policy of many State.  Yet, in each of these areas, the Court has rejected the argument, noting in <em>Roe v.

The reason for this unanimous rejection was stated in <em>Eisenstadt v.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is substantial reason for doubt whether limiting access to contraceptives will, in fact, substantially discourage early sexual behavior.  Appellants themselves conceded in the District Court that "there is no evidence that teenage extramarital sexual activity increases in proportion to the availability of contraceptives," 398 F.Supp. at 332, and n. 10, and accordingly offered none, in the District Court or here.  Appellees, on the other hand, cite a considerable body of evidence and opinion indicating that there is no such deterrent effect. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Although we take judicial notice, as did the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 431 U.

It is enough that we again confirm the principle that, when a State, as here, burdens the exercise of a fundamental right, its attempt to justify that burden as a rational means for the accomplishment of some significant state policy requires more than a bare assertion, based on a conceded complete absence of supporting evidence, that the burden is connected to such a policy.

S. 697</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants argue that New York does not totally prohibit distribution of contraceptives to minors under 16, and that, accordingly, \xc2\xa7 611(8) cannot be held unconstitutional.  Although \xc2\xa7 6811(8), on its face, is a flat unqualified prohibition, Educ.Law \xc2\xa7 6807(b) (McKinney, Supp. 1976 1977), <em>see</em> nn.  <a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a> <a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a> and  <a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a> <em>supra,</em> provides that nothing in Education Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6800-6826 shall be construed to prevent "[a]ny physician . . . from supplying his patients with such drugs as [he] . . . deems proper in connection with his practice."  This narrow exception, however, does not save the statute.  As we have held above as to limitations upon distribution to adults, less than total restrictions on access to contraceptives that significantly burden the right to decide whether to bear children must also pass constitutional scrutiny.  Appellants assert no medical necessity for imposing a medical limitation on the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives to minors.  Rather, they argue that such a restriction serves to emphasize to young people the seriousness with which the State views the decision to engage in sexual intercourse at an early age. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  But this is only another form of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="698">Page 431 U.

PPA alleges that it has violated the challenged statute in the past, and continues to violate it in the regular course of its business; that it has been advised by the authorities responsible for enforcing the statute that it is in violation; and that, on at least one occasion, it has been threatened with prosecution.

In that case, the challenged state law had fallen into virtual desuetude through lack of prosecution over some 80 years, and plaintiffs alleged no explicit threat of prosecution.

In any event, it is unnecessary to pass upon this contention of appellees, and our decision proceeds on the assumption that the Constitution does not bar state regulation of the sexual behavior of minors.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>We note, moreover, that other provisions of New York law argue strongly against any conclusion that the deterrence of illegal sexual conduct among minors was an objective of \xc2\xa7 6811(8).  First, a girl in New York may marry as young as 14, with the consent of her parents and a family court judge.  N.Y.Dom.Rel.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa715-a, 15(2), 15(3) (McKinney 1964 and Supp. 1976-1977).  Yet, although sexual intercourse by a married woman of that age violates no state law, \xc2\xa7 6811(8) prohibits distribution of contraceptives to her.  Second, New York requires that birth control information and services be provided to recipients of certain welfare programs, provided only that they are "of childbearing age, including children who can be considered sexually active."  N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7350(1)(e) (McKinney 1976); <em>cf.</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(15)(A) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  <em>See also</em> N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7 365-a(3)(c) (McKinney 1976); <em>cf.</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71396d(a) (vii)(4)(C) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Although extramarital intercourse is presumably as contrary to state policy among minors covered by those programs as among others, state law requires distribution of contraceptives to them and prohibits their distribution to all others.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> Settlage, Baroff, &amp; Cooper, Sexual Experience of Younger Teenage Girls Seeking Contraceptive Assistance for the First Time, Family Planning Perspectives 223 (fall 1973); Pilpel &amp; Wechsler, Birth Control, Teenagers and the Law:  A New Look 1971, Family Planning Perspectives 37 (July 1971); Stein, Furnishing Information and Medical Treatment to Minors for Prevention, Termination and Treatment of Pregnancy, Clearinghouse Review 131, 132 (July 1971); Reiss, Contraceptive Information and Sexual Morality, Journal of Sex Research 51 (Apr.1966).  <em>See also</em> Note, Parental Consent Requirements and Privacy Rights of Minors:  The Contraceptive Controversy, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 1001, 1010, and n. 67 (1975); Jordan, A Minor\'s Right to Contraceptives, 7 U.Calif.Davis L.Rev. 270, 272-273 (1974).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 271-273; Kanter &amp; Zelnick, Sexual Experience of Young Unmarried Women in the United States, Family Planning Perspectives 9 (Oct.1972).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Although this is not the occasion for a full examination of these problems, the following data sketchily indicate their extent.

But <em>Ginsberg</em> concerned a statute prohibiting dissemination of obscene material that it held was not constitutionally protected.  In contrast, \xc2\xa7 6811(8) concerns distribution of material access to which is essential to exercise of a fundamental right.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>There is considerable doubt that appellants accurately identify the legislative purposes in enacting Educ.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6807(b) and 6811(8).  Section 6811(8) (formerly Educ.Law \xc2\xa7 6804-b and before that Penal Law \xc2\xa71142(2)) was first enacted in 1965 as a modification, apparently in response to <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965), of former Penal Law \xc2\xa71142, titled "Indecent articles."  1965 N.Y.Laws, c. 637.  This statute, which dated back at least to \xc2\xa7 318 of the Penal Code of 1881, 1881 N.Y.Laws, c. 676, had made it a misdemeanor for any person to distribute or advertise "any instrument or article, or any drug or medicine, for the prevention of conception."  Section 6807(b), on the other hand, general excepts the distribution of drugs by a physician in the course of his practice from all the licensing requirements and restrictions imposed on the practice of pharmacy by Education Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6800-6826 (subject to certain provisos not here relevant).  Such a provision, in one form or another and bearing several different numbers, has been included in the article concerning the practice of pharmacy since that article was first incorporated in the Education Law in 1927, <em>see</em> former Education Law \xc2\xa71361, 1927 N.Y.Laws, c. 85, and before that a similar provision was included in the statutes regulating pharmacy in the Public Health Law.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Public Health Law of 1893, \xc2\xa7187, 1893 N.Y.Laws, c. 661.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 6807(b) and its predecessors long predate the inclusion of \xc2\xa7 6811(8) in the Education Law.</p>\n<p>Even more significantly, when \xc2\xa76811(8) was first enacted as Penal Law \xc2\xa71142(2), it was not subject to the physicians\' exception of \xc2\xa7 6807(b).  Rather, it was apparently subject to a different physicians\' exception, former Penal Law \xc2\xa71145 (\xc2\xa7321 of the Penal Code of 1881), which provided:</p>\n<p>"An article or instrument, used or applied by physicians lawfully practicing, or by their direction or prescription, for the cure or prevention of disease, is not an article of indecent or immoral nature or use within this chapter.  The supplying of such articles to such physicians or by their direction or prescription is not an offense under this chapter."</p>\n<p>This was interpreted by the New York Court of Appeals to permit a physician "in good faith" to use contraceptives to treat "a married person to cure or prevent disease," but not to permit "promiscuous advice to patients irrespective of their condition."  <em>People v. Sanger,</em> 222 N.Y.192, 194-195, 118 N.E. 637, 637-638 (1918), <em>appeal dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,</em> 251 U.S. 537 (1919) (per curiam).  <em>See also People v. Byrne,</em> 99 Misc. 1, 163 N.Y.S. 682 (1917); <em>People v. Baird,</em> 47 Misc.2d 478, 262 N.Y.S.2d 947 (1965).</p>\n<p>In light of this history, it appears that, insofar as the legislature had \xc2\xa7 6807(b) in mind at all when it transferred the prohibition of distribution of contraceptives to those under 16 from the Penal Law to the Education Law, it thought of that section as at most a narrow exception, analogous to \xc2\xa7 1145, permitting physicians, "in connection with [their] practice," to treat or prevent disease, rather than, as appellants assert, intending that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6807(b) and 6811(8) be read together as establishing a scheme under which contraceptives would be freely available to those under 16, but limiting the distribution function to physicians.  The legislative history of attempts in 1972 and 1974 to modify \xc2\xa7 6811(8), to which appellants refer, supports this construction.  The legislators debating those bills seem to have thought of \xc2\xa7 6811(8) as a flat prohibition of the distribution of contraceptives to minors, and made no reference to \xc2\xa7 6807(b).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Doe v.

Here, however, no medical judgment is involved at all; the State purport to commission physicians to engage in moral counseling that can reflect little other than their private views on the morality of premarital sex among the young.  It seems evident that many physicians are likely to have views on this subject to a significant degree more permissive or more restrictive than those of the State, the minor, or the minor\'s parents.  Moreover, nothing in \xc2\xa7 6807(b) suggests that the role of the physician is limited to such "counseling."  The statute does nothing more than to permit the physician to provide his patients with such drugs or devices as he "deems proper."  Such "absolute, and possibly arbitrary" discretion over the privacy rights of minors is precisely what <em>Planned Parenthood</em> condemned.  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#74">428 U.

Under today\'s decision, such regulation "may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#686">431 U.

In my view, the extraordinary protection the Court would give to all personal decisions in matters of sex is neither required by the Constitution nor supported by our prior decisions.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The cases on which the Court relies for its "compelling interest" standard do not support the sweeping principle it adopts today.  Those cases generally involved direct and substantial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="704">Page 431 U. S. 704</a></p><p> interference with constitutionally protected rights.  In <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965), the Court invalidated a state statute prohibiting the use of contraceptives and making it illegal for physicians to give advice to married persons regarding contraception.  The statute was viewed as one "operat[ing] directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician\'s role in one aspect of that relation," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#482">381 U.

Despite the fact that Missouri normally did not require written consent for other surgical procedures, the Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="705">Page 431 U. S. 705</a></p><p> sustained this regulation without requiring any demonstration of compelling state interests.  The Court recognized that the decision to abort "is an important, and often a stressful one," and the State thus constitutionally could assure that the woman was aware of the significance of the decision.  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U. S. 67</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court quite unnecessarily extends the reach of cases like <em>Griswold</em> and <em>Roe.</em>  Neither our precedents nor sound principles of constitutional analysis require state legislation to meet the exacting "compelling state interest" standard whenever it implicates sexual freedom.  In my view, those cases make clear that that standard has been invoked only when the state regulation entirely frustrates or heavily burdens the exercise of constitutional rights in this area.  <em>See Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html#147">428 U. S. 147</a></span> (1976).  This is not to say that other state regulation is free from judicial review.  But a test so severe that legislation rarely can meet it should be imposed by courts with deliberate restraint in view of the respect that properly should be accorded legislative judgments.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>There is also no justification for subjecting restrictions on the sexual activity of the young to heightened judicial review.  Under our prior cases, the States have broad latitude to legislate with respect to adolescents.  The principle is well settled that</p>\n<p>"a State may permissibly determine that, at least in some precisely delineated areas, a child . . . is not possessed of that full capacity for individual choice"</p>\n<p>which is essential to the exercise of various constitutionally protected interests.  <em>Ginsberg v.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>New York has exercised its responsibility over minors in areas falling within the "cluster of constitutionally protected choices" relating to sex and marriage.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#685">431 U.

At issue in <em>Ginsberg v.

Similarly, the relevant question in any case where state laws impinge on the freedom of action of young people in sexual matters is whether the restriction rationally serves valid state interests.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>With these considerations in mind, I turn to the specific provisions of the New York statute limiting the distribution of contraceptives.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>New York has made it a crime for anyone other than a physician to sell or distribute contraceptives to minors under the age of 16 years.  Educ.Law \xc2\xa7 6811(8) (McKinney 1972).  This element of New York\'s program of regulation for the protection of its minor citizens is said to evidence the State\'s judgment that the health and wellbeing of minors would be better assured if they are not encouraged to engage in sexual intercourse without guidance.  Although I have no doubt that properly framed legislation serving this purpose would meet constitutional standards, the New York provision is defective in two respects.  First, it infringes the privacy interests of married females between the ages of 14 and 16, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#695">431 U. S. 695</a></span> n. 18, in that it prohibits the distribution of contraceptives to such females except by a physician.  In authorizing marriage at that age, the State also sanctions sexual intercourse between the partners and expressly recognizes that once the marriage relationship exists the husband and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="708">Page 431 U. S. 708</a></p><p> wife are presumed to possess the requisite understanding and maturity to make decisions concerning sex and procreation.  Consequently, the state interest that justifies a requirement of prior counseling with respect to minors in general simply is inapplicable with respect to minors for whom the State has affirmatively approved marriage.</p>\n<p>Second, this provision prohibits parents from distributing contraceptives to their children, a restriction that unjustifiably interferes with parental interests in rearing their children.  <em>Cf. Ginsberg v. New York,</em> 390 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/629/case.html#639">390 U. S. 639</a></span> and n. 7.</p>\n<p>"[C]onstitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents\' claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic in the structure of our society.  \'It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.,</em> quoting <em>Prince v.

Moreover, this statute would allow the State "to enquire into, prove, and punish," <em>Poe v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#548">367 U. S. 548</a></span> (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting), the exercise of this parental responsibility.  The State points to no interest of sufficient magnitude to justify this direct interference with the parental guidance that is especially appropriate in this sensitive area of child development. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="709">Page 431 U. S. 709</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But, in my view, there is considerably more room for state regulation in this area than would be permissible under the plurality\'s opinion.  It seems clear to me, for example, that the State would further a constitutionally permissible end if it encouraged adolescents to seek the advice and guidance of their parents before deciding whether to engage in sexual intercourse.  <em>Planned Parenthood,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#91">428 U. S. 91</a></span> (STEWART, J., concurring).  The State justifiably may take note of the psychological pressures that might influence children at a time in their lives when they generally do not possess the maturity necessary to understand and control their responses.  Participation in sexual intercourse at an early age may have both physical and psychological consequences.  These include the risks of venereal disease and pregnancy, and the less obvious mental and emotional problems that may result from sexual activity by children.  Moreover, society has long adhered to the view that sexual intercourse should not be engaged in promiscuously, a judgment that an adolescent may be less likely to heed than an adult.</p>\n<p>Requiring minors to seek parental guidance would be consistent with our prior cases.  In <em>Planned Parenthood,</em> we considered whether there was "any significant state interest in conditioning [a minor\'s] abortion [decision] on the consent of a parent or person <em>in loco parentis</em> that is not present in the case of an adult."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#75">428 U. S. 75</a></span>.  Observing that the minor necessarily would be consulting with a physician on all aspects of the abortion decision, we concluded that the Missouri requirement was invalid because it imposed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 431 U. S. 710</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"a special consent provision, exercisable by a person other than the woman and her physician, as a prerequisite to a minor\'s termination of her pregnancy, and [did] so without a sufficient justification for the restriction."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  But we explicitly suggested that a materially different constitutional issue would be presented with respect to a statute assuring in most instances consultation between the parent and child.  <em>Ibid.,</em> citing <em>Bellotti v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html">428 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976).  <em>See Planned Parenthood, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#90">428 U. S. 90</a></span>-91 (STEWART, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>A requirement of prior parental consultation is merely one illustration of permissible regulation in this area.  As long as parental distribution is permitted, a State should have substantial latitude in regulating the distribution of contraceptives to minors. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>New York also makes it a crime for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to sell or distribute contraceptives to adults and to minors aged 16 or over.  The only serious justification offered by the State for this prohibition is that it is necessary to facilitate enforcement of the limitation on distribution to children under 16 years of age.  Since the Court invalidates that limitation today, the pharmacy restriction lacks any rational justification.  I therefore agree with the Court that \xc2\xa7 6811(8)\'s limitation on the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>But even if New York were to enact constitutionally permissible limitations on access for children, I doubt that it could justify the present pharmacy restriction as an enforcement measure.  Restricting the kinds of retail outlets that may distribute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 431 U. S. 711</a></p><p> contraceptives may well be justified, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] but the present statute even prohibits distribution by mail to adults.  In this respect, the statute works a significant invasion of the constitutionally protected privacy in decisions concerning sexual relations.  By requiring individuals to buy contraceptives over the counter, the statute heavily burdens constitutionally protected freedom. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>I also agree with the Court that New York cannot lawfully prohibit all "advertisement or display" of contraceptives.  But it seems to me that the Court\'s opinion may be read too broadly.  It flatly dismisses, as justifications "classically irrelevant," the State\'s contentions that the indiscriminate advertisement of contraceptive products in some settings could be unduly offensive and could be viewed by the young as legitimation of sexual promiscuity.  I agree that these justifications </p><p><a class="page-number" name="712">Page 431 U. S. 712</a></p><p> cannot support a complete ban on advertising, but I see no reason to cast any doubt on the authority of the State to impose carefully tailored restrictions designed to serve legitimate governmental concerns as to the effect of commercial advertising on the young. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS recently provided the following example, deeply rooted in our traditions and law:</p>\n<p>"Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain.  He may not lawfully word or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures.  Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent.  Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant."</p>\n<p>428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#102">428 U. S. 102</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The particular provision at issue makes it a crime for</p>\n<p>"[a]ny person to sell or distribute any instrument or article, or any recipe, drug or medicine for the prevention of contraception to a minor under the age of sixteen years. . . ."</p>\n<p>Educ.Law \xc2\xa7 6811(8) (McKinney 1972).  For the reasons stated in the text, this provision unjustifiably infringes the constitutionally protected interests of parents and married female minors, and it is invalid in those two respects.  Although the prohibition on distribution might be sustained as to other individuals if the restrictions on parental distribution and distribution to married female minors could be treated as severable, the result "would be to create a program quite different from the one the legislature actually adopted."  <em>Sloan v. Lemon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/825/case.html">413 U. S. 825</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/825/case.html#834">413 U. S. 834</a></span> (1973).  I therefore agree with the Court that the entire provision must be invalidated.  <em>See Dorchy v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/286/case.html">264 U.

S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> warrants a reasonable limitation on the means for marketing contraceptives.  Without some limitations on the number and type of retail outlets it would be difficult -- if not impossible -- to effectuate the state interest in assuring that minors are counseled before purchasing contraceptive devices.  As pharmacists are licensed professionals, the State may be justified in relying on them to act responsibly in observing regulations applicable to minors.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>It is not a satisfactory answer that an individual may preserve anonymity as one of a number of customers in a retail outlet.  However impersonal the marketplace may be, it does not approach the privacy of the home.  There may be some risk that mail distribution will occasionally permit circumvention of permissible restrictions with respect to children, but this does not justify the concomitant burden on the constitutional rights of adults.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The State argues that unregulated commercial advertisement of contraceptive products would be viewed by the young as "legitimation" of --  if not an open invitation to -- sexual promiscuity.  The Court simply finds on the basis of the advertisements in the record before us that this interest does not justify total suppression of advertising concerning contraceptives.  The Court does leave open the question whether this or other state interests would justify regulation of the time, place, or manner of such commercial advertising.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#702">431 U.

As Judge Leventhal recently observed in that context:</p>\n<p>"[T]here is a distinction between the all-out prohibition of a censor, and regulation of time and place of speaking out, which still leaves access to a substantial part of the mature audience.

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in Parts I, II, and III of the opinion of the Court, which I join, I agree that Population Planning Associates, Inc., has standing to challenge the New York statute and that the grant to licensed pharmacists of a monopoly in the distribution of nonmedical contraceptives is unconstitutional.  I also agree with the conclusion that New York\'s prohibition against the distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16 years of age is unconstitutional, and with the Court\'s conclusion that the total suppression of advertising or display of contraceptives is invalid, but my reasons differ from those set forth in Part IV of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="713">Page 431 U. S. 713</a></p><p> opinion and I wish to add emphasis to the limitation on the Court\'s holding in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#700">431 U. S. </a></span></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>There are two reasons why I do not join  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#691">431 U. S. </a></span> First, the holding in <em>Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html">428 U. S. 52</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#72">428 U. S. 72</a></span>-75, that a minor\'s decision to abort her pregnancy may not be conditioned on parental consent, is not dispositive here.  The options available to the already pregnant minor are fundamentally different from those available to nonpregnant minors.  The former must bear a child unless she aborts; but persons in the latter category can and generally will avoid childbearing by abstention.  Consequently, even if I had joined that part of <em>Planned Parenthood,</em> I could not agree that the Constitution provides the same measure of protection to the minor\'s right to use contraceptives as to the pregnant female\'s right to abort.</p>\n<p>Second, I would not leave open the question whether there is a significant state interest in discouraging sexual activity among unmarried persons under 16 years of age.  Indeed, I would describe as "frivolous" appellees\' argument that a minor has the constitutional right to put contraceptives to their intended use, notwithstanding the combined objection of both parents and the State.</p>\n<p>For the reasons explained by MR. JUSTICE POWELL, I agree that the statute may not be applied to married females between the ages of 14 and 16, or to distribution by parents.  I am not persuaded, however, that these glaring defects alone justify an injunction against other applications of the statute.  Only one of the three plaintiffs in this case is a parent who wishes to give contraceptives to his children.  The others are an Episcopal minister who sponsors a program against venereal disease, and a mail-order firm, which presumably has no way to determine the age of its customers.  I am satisfied, for the reasons that follow, that the statute is also invalid as applied to them. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="714">Page 431 U. S. 714</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The State\'s important interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a number of protective measures.  <em>See Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v Danforth, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#102">428 U. S. 102</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Such special legislation is premised on the fact that young persons frequently make unwise choices with harmful consequences; the State may properly ameliorate those consequences by providing, for example, that a minor may not be required to honor his bargain.  It is almost unprecedented, however, for a State to require that an ill-advised act by a minor give rise to greater risk of irreparable harm than a similar act by an adult. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Common sense indicates that many young people will engage in sexual activity regardless of what the New York Legislature does; and further, that the incidence of venereal disease and premarital pregnancy is affected by the availability or unavailability of contraceptives.  Although young persons theoretically may avoid those harms by practicing total abstention, inevitably many will not.  The statutory prohibition denies them and their parents a choice which, if available, would reduce their exposure to disease or unwanted pregnancy. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="715">Page 431 U. S. 715</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The State\'s asserted justification is a desire to inhibit sexual conduct by minors under 16.  Appellants do not seriously contend that, if contraceptives are available, significant numbers of minors who now abstain from sex will cease abstaining because they will no longer fear pregnancy or disease. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Rather, appellants\' central argument is that the statute has the important symbolic effect of communicating disapproval of sexual activity by minors. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  In essence, therefore, the statute is defended as a form of propaganda, rather than a regulation of behavior. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the State may properly perform a teaching function, it seems to me that an attempt to persuade by inflicting harm on the listener is an unacceptable means of conveying a message that is otherwise legitimate.  The propaganda technique used in this case significantly increases the risk of unwanted pregnancy and venereal disease.  It is as though a State decided to dramatize its disapproval of motorcycles by forbidding the use of safety helmets.  One need not posit a constitutional right to ride a motorcycle to characterize such a restriction as irrational and perverse.</p>\n<p>Even as a regulation of behavior, such a statute would be defective.  Assuming that the State could impose a uniform </p><p><a class="page-number" name="716">Page 431 U. S. 716</a></p><p> sanction upon young persons who risk self-inflicted harm by operating motorcycles, or by engaging in sexual activity, surely that sanction could not take the form of deliberately injuring the cyclist or infecting the promiscuous child.  If such punishment may not be administered deliberately, after trial and a finding of guilt, it manifestly cannot be imposed by a legislature, indiscriminately and at random.  This kind of government-mandated harm, is, in my judgment, appropriately characterized as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#700">431 U. S. </a></span> the Court holds that New York\'s total ban on contraceptive advertising is unconstitutional under <em>Bigelow v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html">421 U. S. 809</a></span>, and <em>Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/748/case.html">425 U. S. 748</a></span>.  Specifically, the Court holds that all contraceptive advertising may not be suppressed because some advertising of that subject may be offensive and embarrassing to the reader or listener.  I also agree with that holding.</p>\n<p>The Court properly does not decide whether the State may impose any regulation on the content of contraceptive advertising in order to minimize its offensive character.

If those responsible for these Amendments, by feats of valor or efforts of draftsmanship, could have lived to know that their efforts had enshrined in the Constitution the right of commercial vendors of contraceptives to peddle them to unmarried minors through such means as window displays and vending machines located in the men\'s room of truck stops, notwithstanding the considered judgment of the New York Legislature to the contrary, it is not difficult to imagine their reaction.

S. 718</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I do not believe that the cases discussed in the Court\'s opinion require any such result, but to debate the Court\'s treatment of the question on a case-by-case basis would concede more validity to the result reached by the Court than I am willing to do. [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  There comes a point when endless and ill-considered extension of principles originally formulated in quite different cases produces such an indefensible result that no logic chopping can possibly make the fallacy of the result more obvious.  The Court here in effect holds that the First and Fourteenth Amendments not only guarantee full and free debate <em>before</em> a legislative judgment as to the moral dangers to which minors within the jurisdiction of the State should not be subjected, but goes further and absolutely prevents the representatives of the majority from carrying out such a policy <em>after</em> the issues have been fully aired.</p>\n<p>No questions of religious belief, compelled allegiance to a secular creed, or decisions on the part of married couples as to procreation, are involved here.  New York has simply decided that it wishes to discourage unmarried minors under 16 from having promiscuous sexual intercourse with one another.  Even the Court would scarcely go so far as to say that this is not a subject with which the New York Legislature may properly concern itself.</p>\n<p>That legislature has not chosen to deny to a pregnant woman, after the <em>fait accompli</em> of pregnancy, the one remedy which would enable her to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.  It has instead sought to deter the conduct which will produce such <em>faits accomplis.</em>  The majority of New York\'s citizens are in effect told that however deeply they may be concerned about the problem of promiscuous sex and intercourse among unmarried teenagers, they may not adopt this means of dealing with it.  The Court holds that New York may not use its police power to legislate in the interests of its concept of the public morality as it pertains to minors.  The Court\'s denial of a power so fundamental to self-government must, in the long run, prove to be but a temporary departure from a wise and heretofore settled course of adjudication to the contrary.  I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>As well as striking down the New York prohibitions of commercial advertising and sales to persons under 16, the Court holds invalid the State\'s requirement that all ales be made by licensed pharmacists. Whatever New York\'s reasons for this particular restriction on distribution -- and several can be imagined -- I cannot believe that it could significantly impair the access to these products of a person with a settled and deliberate intention to procure them.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/2" name="F4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]</p>\n<p>I cannot, however, let pass without comment the statement that</p>\n<p>"the Court has not definitively answered the difficult question whether and to what extent the Constitution prohibits state statutes regulating [private] consensual sexual behavior among adults."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#688">431 U.
