C. \xc2\xa7 924(a) (1)(D) to the Criminal Code to prohibit anyone from "willfully" violating, <i>inter alia, </i>\xc2\xa7 922(a)(I)(A), which forbids dealing in firearms without a federal license. The evidence at petitioner\'s unlicensed dealing trial was adequate to prove that he was dealing in firearms and that he knew his conduct was unlawful, but there was no evidence that he was aware of the federal licensing requirement. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that he could be convicted only if he knew of the federal licensing requirement, instructing, instead, that a person acts "willfully" if he acts with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law, but that he need not be aware of the specific law that his conduct may be violating. The jury found petitioner guilty. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited "ample proof" that petitioner had acted willfully.</p><p><i>Held: </i>The term "willfully" in \xc2\xa7 924(a)(I)(D) requires proof only that the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful, not that he also knew of the federal licensing requirement. pp. 191-200.</p><p>(a) When used in the criminal context, a "willful" act is generally one undertaken with a "bad purpose." See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Heikkinen </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/273/case.html">355 U. S. 273</a>, 279.

The Court rejects petitioner\'s argument that, for two principal reasons, a more particularized showing is required here. His first contention-that the "knowingly" requirement in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 924(a)(I)(A)-(C) for three categories of acts made unlawful by \xc2\xa7 922 demonstrates that the Government must prove knowledge of the law-is not persuasive because "knowingly" refers to knowledge of the facts constituting the offense, as distinguished from knowledge of the law, see, <i>e. </i>g., <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bailey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/394/case.html">444 U.

With respect to the three \xc2\xa7 924 "knowingly" categories, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove an evil-meaning mind. As regards the "willfully" category here at issue, however, the jury must find that the defendant acted with such a mind, i. <i>e., </i>with knowledge that his</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="185">185</a></p><p>conduct was unlawful. Also rejected is petitioner\'s second argument: that \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) must be read to require knowledge of the law in light of this Court\'s adoption of a similar interpretation in cases concerned with willful violations of the tax laws, see, <i>e. g., Cheek </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/192/case.html">498 U. S. 192</a>, 201, and the willful structuring of cash transactions to avoid a bank reporting requirement, see <i>Ratzlaj, </i>510 U. S., at 138, 149. Those cases are readily distinguishable because they involved highly technical statutes that threatened to ensnare individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct. That danger is not present here because the jury found that this petitioner knew that his conduct was unlawful.

His next argumentthat, at the time FOPA was passed, the "willfulness" requirements in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 923(d)(1)(C)-(D) had uniformly been interpreted to require knowledge of the law-is inaccurate because a number of courts had reached different conclusions. Moreover, the cases adopting petitioner\'s view support the notion that disregard of a known legal obligation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, but in no way make it necessary. Petitioner\'s final argument-that \xc2\xa7 922(b)(3), which is governed by \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D), indicates that Congress intended "willfully" to include knowledge of the law-fails for a similar reason.

In Title IV of that Act Congress made findings concerning the impact of the traffic in firearms on the prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States 1 and amended the Criminal Code</p><p>*Briefs of <i>amici curiae </i>urging reversal were filed for the Gun Owners Foundation by <i>James H. Jeffries III </i>and <i>James H. Wentzel; </i>and for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by <i>Barbara Bergman </i>and <i>Stephen P. Halbrook.</i></p><p>1 "Sec. 901. (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares-</p><p>"(1) that there is a widespread traffic in firearms moving in or otherwise affecting interstate or foreign commerce, and that the existing Federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power;</p><p>"(2) that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms other than a rifle or shotgun (including criminals, juveniles without the knowledge or consent of their parents or guardians, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, armed groups who would supplant the functions of duly constituted public authorities, and others whose possession of such weapons is similarly contrary to the public interest) is a significant factor in the prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States;</p><p>"(3) that only through adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and over all persons engaging in the businesses of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can this grave</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="187">187</a></p><p>to include detailed provisions regulating the use and sale of firearms. As amended, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 922 defined a number of "unlawful acts"; subsection (a)(l) made it unlawful for any person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.2 Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and \xc2\xa7 924 specified the penalties for violating "any provision of this chapter." Read literally, \xc2\xa7 924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, "or both," on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.3 As enacted in 1968, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 922(a)(1) and 924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms. The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the term "engaged in the business" even though that conduct was an element of the unlawful act prohibited by \xc2\xa7 922(a)(1).</p><p>In 1986 Congress enacted the Firearms Owners\' Protection Act (FOPA), in part, to cure these omissions. The findings in that statute explained that additional legislation was necessary to protect law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for lawful pur-</p><p>problem be properly dealt with, and effective State and local regulation of this traffic be made possible .... " 82 Stat. 225.</p><p>282 Stat. 228. The current version of this provision, which is substantially the same as the 1968 version, is codified at 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 922(a)(I)(A). It states:</p><p>"(a) It shall be unlawful"(1) for any person-</p><p>"(A) except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce."</p><p>3 "\xc2\xa7 924. Penalties</p><p>"(a) Whoever violates any provision of this chapter ... shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both." 82 Stat. 233.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="188">188</a></p><p>poses.4 FOPA therefore amended \xc2\xa7 921 to include a definition of the term "engaged in the business," 5 and amended \xc2\xa7 924 to add a scienter requirement as a condition to the imposition of penalties for most of the unlawful acts defined in \xc2\xa7 922. For three categories of offenses the intent required is that the defendant acted "knowingly"; for the fourth category, which includes "any other provision of this chapter," the required intent is that the defendant acted "willfully." 6</p><p>4 "The Congress finds that-</p><p>"(b)(2) additional legislation is required to reaffirm the intent of the Congress, as expressed in section 101 of the Gun Control Act of 1968, that \'it is not the purpose of this title to place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other lawful activity, and that this title is not intended to discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\'\'\' 100 Stat. 449.</p><p>5 "Section 921 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-</p><p>"(21) The term \'engaged in the business\' means-</p><p>"(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921 (a)(ll)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms ... ." 100 Stat. 449-450.</p><p>6 Title 18 U.

That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called "straw purchasers" in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing. The evidence was unquestionably adequate to prove that petitioner was dealing in firearms, and that he knew that his conduct was unlawful.8 There was, however, no evidence that he was aware of the federal law that prohibits dealing in firearms without a federal license.</p><p>Petitioner was charged with a conspiracy to violate 18 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 922(a)(1)(A), by willfully engaging in the business of dealing in firearms, and with a substantive violation of that provision.9 After the close of evidence, petitioner requested that the trial judge instruct the jury that petitioner could be convicted only if he knew of the federal</p><p>"(C) knowingly imports or brings into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition in violation of section 922(l); or "(D) willfully violates any other provision of this chapter,</p><p>"shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years, or both."</p><p>7 See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p><p>8 Why else would he make use of straw purchasers and assure them that he would shave the serial numbers off the guns? Moreover, the street corner sales are not consistent with a good-faith belief in the legality of the enterprise.</p><p>9 Although the prohibition against unlicensed dealing in firearms is set forth in \xc2\xa7 922, see n. 2, <i>supra, </i>the criminal sanction is set forth in \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1), see n. 6, <i>supra.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="190">190</a></p><p>licensing requirement,lO but the judge rejected this request. Instead, the trial judge gave this explanation of the term "willfully":</p><blockquote><p>\n"A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and purposely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law. Now, the person need not be aware of the specific law or rule that his conduct may be violating. But he must act with the intent to do something that the law forbids." 11</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner was found guilty on both counts. On appeal he argued that the evidence was insufficient because there was no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failing to instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essential element of the offense. The Court of Appeals affirmed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/122/90/">122 F.3d 90</a> (CA2 1997). It concluded that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited "ample proof" that petitioner had acted willfully.

The jury apparently found, and the evidence clearly shows, that Bryan was aware in a general way that some aspect of his conduct was unlawful. See <i>ante, </i>at 189, and n. 8. The issue is whether that general knowledge of illegality is enough to sustain the conviction, or whether a "willful" violation of the licensing provision requires proof that the defendant knew that his conduct was unlawful specifically because he lacked the necessary license. On that point the statute is, in my view, genuinely ambiguous. Most of the Court\'s opinion is devoted to confirming half of that ambiguity by refuting Bryan\'s various arguments that the statute clearly requires specific knowledge of the licensing requirement. <i>Ante, </i>at 192-199. The Court offers no real justification for its implicit conclusion that either (1) the statute unambiguously requires only general knowledge of illegality, or (2) ambiguously requiring only general knowledge is enough.

S. 135</a>, 141 (1994), quoting <i>Spies </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/492/case.html">317 U. S. 492</a>, 497 (1943). In some contexts it connotes nothing more than "an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Murdock, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/389/case.html">290 U. S. 389</a>, 394 (1933). In the present context, however, inasmuch as the preceding three subparagraphs of \xc2\xa7 924 specify a <i>mens rea </i>of "knowingly" for <i>other </i>firearms offenses, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(A)-(C), a "willful" violation under \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) must require some mental state more culpable than mere intent to perform the forbidden act. The United States concedes (and the Court apparently agrees) that the violation is not "willful" unless the defendant knows in a general way that his conduct is unlawful. Brief for United States 7-9; <i>ante, </i>at 193 ("The jury must find that the defendant acted with an evil-meaning mind, that is to say, that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful").</p><p>That concession takes this case beyond any useful application of the maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Everyone agrees that \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) requires some knowledge of the law; the only real question is <i>which </i>law? The Court\'s answer is that knowledge of <i>any </i>law is enough-or, put another way, that the defendant must be ignorant of <i>every </i>law violated by his course of conduct to be innocent of willfully violating the licensing requirement. The Court points to no</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="202">202</a></p><p>textual basis for that conclusion other than the notoriously malleable word "willfully" itself. Instead, it seems to fall back on a presumption (apparently derived from the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse) that even where ignorance of the law <i>is </i>an excuse, that excuse should be construed as narrowly as the statutory language permits.</p><p>I do not believe that the Court\'s approach makes sense of the statute that Congress enacted. I have no quarrel with the Court\'s assertion that "willfully" in \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) requires only "general" knowledge of illegality-in the sense that the defendant need not be able to recite chapter and verse from Title 18 of the United States Code. It is enough, in my view, if the defendant is generally aware that the <i>actus reus </i>punished by the statute-dealing in firearms without a license-is illegal. But the Court is willing to accept a <i>mens rea </i>so "general" that it is entirely divorced from the <i>actus reus </i>this statute was enacted to punish. That approach turns \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) into a strange and unlikely creature. Bryan would be guilty of "willfully" dealing in firearms without a federal license even if, for example, he had never heard of the licensing requirement but was aware that he had violated the law by using straw purchasers or filing the serial numbers off the pistols. <i>Ante, </i>at 189, n. 8. The Court does not even limit (for there is no rational basis to limit) the universe of relevant laws to federal <i>firearms </i>statutes. Bryan would also be "act[ing] with an evil-meaning mind," and hence presumably be guilty of "willfully" dealing in firearms without a license, if he knew that his streetcorner transactions violated New York City\'s business licensing or sales tax ordinances. (For that matter, it ought to suffice if Bryan knew that the car out of which he sold the guns was illegally double-parked, or if, in order to meet the appointed time for the sale, he intentionally violated Pennsylvania\'s speed limit on the drive back from the gun purchase in Ohio.) Once we stop focusing on the conduct the defendant is actually charged with (i. <i>e., </i>selling guns without</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="203">203</a></p><p>a license), I see no principled way to determine <i>what </i>law the defendant must be conscious of violating. See, <i>e. g., Lewis </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/155/case.html">523 U. S. 155</a>, 174-175 (1998) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (pointing out a similar interpretive problem potentially raised by the Assimilative Crimes Act).</p><p>Congress is free, of course, to make criminal liability under one statute turn on knowledge of another, to use its firearms dealer statutes to encourage compliance with New York City\'s tax collection efforts, and to put judges and juries through the kind of mental gymnastics described above. But these are strange results, and I would not lightly assume that Congress intended to make liability under a federal criminal statute depend so heavily upon the vagaries of local law-particularly local law dealing with completely unrelated subjects. If we must have a presumption in cases like this one, I think it would be more reasonable to presume that, when Congress makes ignorance of the law a defense to a criminal prohibition, it ordinarily means ignorance of the unlawfulness of the specific conduct punished <i>by that criminal prohibition.</i></p><p>That is the meaning we have given the word "willfully" in other contexts where we have concluded it requires knowledge of the law. See, <i>e. g., Ratzlaj, supra, </i>at 149 ("To convict Ratzlaf of the crime with which he was charged, ... the jury had to find he knew the structuring in which he engaged was unlawful"); <i>Cheek </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/192/case.html">498 U. S. 192</a>, 201 (1991) ("[T]he standard for the statutory willfulness requirement is the \'voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.\' ... [T]he issue is whether the defendant knew of the duty purportedly imposed by the provision of the statute or regulation he is accused of violating"). The Court explains these cases on the ground that they involved "highly technical statutes that presented the danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct." <i>Ante, </i>at 194. That is no explanation at all. The complexity of the tax and currency laws may explain why the Court interpreted</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="204">204</a></p><p>"willful" to require some awareness of illegality, as opposed to merely "an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental." <i>Murdock, </i>290 U. S., at 394. But it <i>in no way </i>justifies the distinction the Court seeks to draw today between knowledge of the law the defendant is actually charged with violating and knowledge of <i>any </i>law the defendant could conceivably be charged with violating. To protect the pure of heart, it is not necessary to forgive someone whose surreptitious laundering of drug money violates, unbeknownst to him, a technical currency statute. There, as here, regardless of how "complex" the violated statute may be, the defendant would have acted "with an evil-meaning mind."</p><p>It seems to me likely that Congress had a presumption of offense-specific knowledge of illegality in mind when it enacted the provision here at issue. Another section of the Firearms Owners\' Protection Act, Pub. L. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449, prohibits licensed dealers from selling firearms to outof-state residents unless they fully comply with the laws of both States. 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 922(b)(3). The provision goes on to state that all licensed dealers "shall be presumed, for purposes of this subparagraph, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States." <i>Ibid. </i>Like the dealer-licensing provision at issue here, a violation of \xc2\xa7 922(b)(3) is a criminal offense only if committed "willfully" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D). The Court is quite correct that this provision does not establish beyond doubt that "willfully" requires knowledge of the particular prohibitions violated: the fact that knowledge (attributed knowledge) of those prohibitions will be <i>sufficient </i>does not demonstrate conclusively that knowledge of <i>other </i>prohibitions will <i>not </i>be sufficient. <i>Ante, </i>at 198-199. But though it does not <i>demonstrate, </i>it certainly <i>suggests. </i>To say that only willful violation of a certain law is criminal, but that knowledge of the existence of that law is presumed, fairly reflects, I think, a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="205">205</a></p><p>presumption that willful violation requires knowledge of the law violated.</p><p>If one had to choose, therefore, I think a presumption of statutory intent that is the opposite of the one the Court applies would be more reasonable. I would not, however, decide this case on the basis of any presumption at all. It is common ground that the statutory context here requires some awareness of the law for a \xc2\xa7 924(a)(1)(D) conviction, but the statute is simply ambiguous, or silent, as to the precise contours of that <i>mens rea </i>requirement. In the face of that ambiguity, I would invoke the rule that" \'ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity,\'" <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bass, </i>404 U. S., at 347, quoting <i>Rewis </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/808/case.html">401 U. S. 808</a>, 812 (1971).</p><blockquote><p>\n"The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Wiltberger, 5 </i>Wheat. 76, 95 (1820).</p></blockquote><p>In our era of multiplying new federal crimes, there is more reason than ever to give this ancient canon of construction consistent application: by fostering uniformity in the interpretation of criminal statutes, it will reduce the occasions on which this Court will have to produce judicial havoc by resolving in defendants\' favor a Circuit conflict regarding the substantive elements of a federal crime, see, <i>e. g., Bousley </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/614/case.html">523 U.
