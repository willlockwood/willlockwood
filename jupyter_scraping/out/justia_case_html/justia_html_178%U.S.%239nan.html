The bill stated the Western Union Telegraph Company to be "a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, and a citizen of the said State of New York," and the Ann Arbor Railroad Company to be "a corporation organized and existing under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 178 U.

The bill alleged that, on the 25th day of September, 1890, the Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company, a corporation of the State of Michigan, owned and operated a railroad from Frankfort to near Copemish, Michigan; that, on that day, complainant entered into a contract with the Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company for the construction and maintenance of a telegraph line along the entire length of its road; that in pursuance of the contract and in May, June, and July, 1891, complainant built the telegraph lines provided for therein; that one wire was erected for the joint use of the railroad company and complainant, and a loop to Frankfort and back was put on the poles for the exclusive use of complainant.  It was further alleged that the railroad of the Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company was sold sometime in May, 1892, and transferred to the Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; North Michigan Railroad Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Michigan; that afterwards said last-mentioned company mortgaged their entire railroad to the Farmers\' Loan &amp; Trust Company as trustee, and said mortgage being in default a bill was filed to foreclose it in September, 1893, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Michigan, to which foreclosure suit complainant was not a party; that the whole road was sold under order of court and conveyed to the Ann Arbor Railroad Company, and the sale and conveyance were confirmed; that the last-mentioned company now claimed to be in possession and operating the road formerly known as the Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad.  And further, that the Ann Arbor Railroad Company purchased the road with full knowledge of complainant\'s rights, but that it insisted that it was not bound by the contract made with the Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company, and had given complainant written notice to that effect.</p>\n<p>The sixth and seventh paragraphs of the bill were as follows:</p>\n<p>"6th.

From this decree an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals, and that court affirmed the decree.  90 F. 379.  From the decree of the circuit court of appeals the Western Union Telegraph Company appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Western Union Telegraph Company might have instituted its suit in the circuit court, but it sought the state tribunals, as it had the right to do, and the defendant could not remove the case on the ground of diverse citizenship, although that fact existed, because it was itself a resident of the state.  Defendant\'s application to remove therefore was based on the averment that the suit arose "under the Constitution and laws of the United States."  Whether it did so arise depended on complainant\'s statement of its own case.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/454/case.html">Tennessee v. Bank,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 178 U. S. 243</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/152/454/case.html">152 U. S. 454</a></span>.  And the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the bill contain all that defendant could have relied on as bringing the case within that category.  These paragraphs were to the effect that complainant had accepted the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 24, 1866, and that, independent of the contract, it had</p>\n<p>"a right to maintain its telegraph line on what was formerly said Frankfort &amp; Southeastern Railroad, under the provisions of the statute of the United States."</p>\n<p>The bill was in legal effect a bill for the specific performance of the contract set up in the pleadings, and the prayer was for injunction against interference with complainant\'s alleged rights, and that defendant allow complainant to reconnect its said wires, and use them in the same way as before they were disturbed by defendant, "and that defendant be required to carry out said contract in good faith," and for general relief.</p>\n<p>It was not argued by counsel for the telegraph company that the telegraph company had any right under the statute, and independently of the contract, to maintain and operate this telegraph line over the railroad company\'s property, and it has been long settled that that statute did not confer on telegraph companies the right to enter on private property without the consent of the owner, and erect the necessary structures for their business;</p>\n<p>"but it does provide that, whenever the consent of the owner is obtained, no state legislation shall prevent the occupation of post roads for telegraph purposes by such corporations as are willing to avail themselves of its privileges."</p>\n<p><em>Pensacola Telegraph Company v. Western Union Telegraph Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/1/case.html">96 U. S. 1</a></span>.  In that case, Mr. Chief Justice Waite further said:</p>\n<p>"No question arises as to the authority of Congress to provide for the appropriation of private property to the uses of the telegraph, for no such attempt has been made.  The use of public property alone is granted.  If private property is required, it must, so far as the present legislation is concerned, be obtained by private arrangement with its owner.  No compulsory proceedings are authorized."</p>\n<p>When a suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States upon the determination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 178 U. S. 244</a></p><p> of which the result depends, it is not a suit arising under the Constitution or laws.  And it must appear on the record, by a statement in legal and logical form such as is required in good pleading, that the suit is one which does really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to a right which depends on the construction of the Constitution or some law or treaty of the United States, before jurisdiction can be maintained on this ground.  <em>Gold-Washing &amp; Water Co. v. Keyes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/199/case.html">96 U. S. 199</a></span>; <em>Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/571/case.html">175 U. S. 571</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We are unable to perceive that paragraphs sixth and seventh met this requirement, and it does not appear to us that they were intended to do so by the pleader.  As we have said, it was not asserted in argument that the telegraph company had the right independently of the contract to maintain its line on the railroad company\'s property, and in view of the settled construction of the statute, we could not permit such a contention to be recognized as the basis of jurisdiction.  But it was argued that, by virtue of the statute, the telegraph company was possessed of a public character and was discharging public duties, and that, although the interest it acquired by its contract was subject to the prior mortgage, it could not be absolutely deprived thereof by foreclosure, but that  the circuit court should have so framed its decree as to preserve the occupancy of the telegraph company, subject to making compensation to the railroad company, the value of the alleged easement to be ascertained by the court.  It is sufficient to say that the bill was not framed in that aspect, and, though there was a prayer for general relief, relief cannot be awarded under that prayed unless it is such relief as is agreeable to the case made by the bill.  And it is entirely clear that there were no averments in the bill in respect of this contention which would bring the case within the category of cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States so that jurisdiction could be held to have rested on that ground.</p>\n<p><em>The result is that the decrees of the circuit court of appeals and of the circuit court must be reversed, and the cause be remanded to the latter court with a direction to remand it to the state court.  And it is so ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
