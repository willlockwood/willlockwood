Nken acknowledged that Circuit precedent required an alien seeking such a stay to satisfy 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(f)(2), which sharply restricts the availability of injunctions blocking the removal of an alien from this country, but argued that a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to stay a removal order should instead be controlled by the traditional criteria governing stays.  The Court of Appeals denied the stay motion without comment.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Traditional stay factors, not the demanding \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) standard, govern a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 authority to stay an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal pending judicial review.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This question stems from changes made in the Illegal Im-\nmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA), which \xe2\x80\x9crepealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in\n[8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa71105a [(1994 ed.),] and instituted a new (and significantly more restrictive) one in \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa71252,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/471/index.html">525 U. S. 471</a>, 475 (<em>AAADC</em>).  Because courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction before IIRIRA to review the removal order of an alien who had already left the United States, see \xc2\xa71105a(c), most aliens who appealed such a decision were given an automatic stay of the removal order pending judicial review, see \xc2\xa71105a(a)(3).  Three changes IIRIRA made are of particular importance here.  First, the repeal of \xc2\xa71105a allows courts to adjudicate a petition for review even if the alien is removed while the petition is pending.  Second, the presumption of an automatic stay was repealed and replaced with a provision stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ervice of the petition \xe2\x80\xa6 does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B).  Finally, IIRIRA provided that \xe2\x80\x9cno court shall enjoin the removal of any alien \xe2\x80\xa6 unless [he] shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The parties dispute what standard a court should apply when determining whether to grant a stay.  Petitioner argues that the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d stay standard should apply, meaning a court should consider \xe2\x80\x9c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether [he] will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0; and (4) where the public interest lies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>Braunskill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/770/index.html">481 U. S. 770</a>, 776.  The Government argues that \xc2\xa71252(f) should govern, meaning an alien must show \xe2\x80\x9cby clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of [the removal] order is prohibited as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0An appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s power to hold an order in abeyance while it assesses the order\xe2\x80\x99s legality has been described as inherent, and part of a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional equipment for the administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/4/index.html">316 U. S. 4</a>, 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  That power allows a court to act responsibly, by ensuring that the time the court takes to bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it does not result in irreparable injury to the party aggrieved by the order under review.  But a stay \xe2\x80\x9cis not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginian R. Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/658/index.html">272 U. S. 658</a>, 672.  The parties and the public, while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are also entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature has made final.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Section 1252(f) does not refer to \xe2\x80\x9cstays,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to authority to \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin the removal of any alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  An injunction and a stay serve different purposes.  The former is the means by which a court tells someone what to do or not to do.  While in a general sense many orders may be considered injunctions, the term is typically used to refer to orders that operate <em>in personam</em>.  By contrast, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding itself, either by halting or postponing some portion of it, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.  An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication of a petition for review does not ask for a coercive order against the government, but instead asks to temporarily set aside the removal order.  That kind of stay, \xe2\x80\x9crelat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</em> v. <em>Mayacamas Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/271/index.html">485 U. S. 271</a>, 279.  That \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays is evident in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(3)(B) but not subsection (f)(2), particularly since those subsections were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s structure also clearly supports petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading: Because subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering stays of removal, the natural place to locate an amendment to the standard governing stays would have been subsection (b)(3)(B), not a provision four subsections later that makes no mention of stays.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Subsection (f)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s application would not fulfill the historic office of a stay, which is to hold the matter under review in abeyance to allow the appellate court sufficient time to decide the merits.  Under subsection (f)(2), a stay would only be granted after the court in effect <em>decides </em>the merits, in an expedited manner.  The court would have to do so under a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard that does not so much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it redundant.  Nor would subsection (f)(2) allow courts \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent irreparable injury to the parties or to the public\xe2\x80\x9d pending review, <em>Scripps-Howard</em>, 316 U. S., at 9; the subsection on its face does not permit any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise.  In short, applying \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) in the stay context would result in something that does not remotely look like a stay.  As in <em>Scripps-Howard</em>, the Court is loath to conclude that Congress would, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary power to stay orders under review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11.  The Court is not convinced Congress did so in \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(f)\xc2\xa0The parties dispute what the traditional four-factor standard entails.  A stay is not a matter of right, and its issuance depends on the circumstances of a particular case.  The first factor, a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, requires more than a mere possibility that relief will be granted.  Similarly, simply showing some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy the second factor.  See <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, that burden alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.  An alien who has been removed may continue to pursue a petition for review, and those aliens who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigration status they had upon removal.  The third and fourth factors, harm to the opposing party and the public interest, merge when the Government is the opposing party.  In considering them, courts must be mindful that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s role as the respondent in every removal proceeding does not make its interest in each one negligible.  There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders, see <em>AAADC, supra</em>, at 490, and that interest may be heightened by circumstances such as a particularly dangerous alien, or an alien who has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes provided to him.  A court asked to stay removal cannot simply assume that the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s favor.

Sometimes a little; sometimes a lot.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo court can make time stand still\xe2\x80\x9d while it considers an appeal, <em>Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/316/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/316/4/index.html">316 U. S. 4</a>, 9 (1942), and if a court takes the time it needs, the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision may in some cases come too late for the party seeking review.  That is why it \xe2\x80\x9chas always been held, \xe2\x80\xa6 that as part of its traditional equipment for the administration of justice, a federal court can stay the enforcement of a judgment pending the outcome of an appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (footnote omitted).  A stay does not make time stand still, but does hold a ruling in abeyance to allow an appellate court the time necessary to review it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case involves a statutory provision that sharply restricts the circumstances under which a court may issue an injunction blocking the removal of an alien from this country.  The Court of Appeals concluded, and the Government contends, that this provision applies to the granting of a stay by a court of appeals while it considers the legality of a removal order.  Petitioner disagrees, and maintains that the authority of a court of appeals to stay an order of removal under the traditional criteria governing stays remains fully intact, and is not affected by the statutory provision governing injunctions.  We agree with petitioner, and vacate and remand for application of the traditional criteria.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jean Marc Nken, a citizen of Cameroon, entered the United States on a transit visa in April 2001.  In December 2001, he applied for asylum under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71158, withholding of removal under \xc2\xa71231(b)(3), and deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, art. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\xe2\x80\x9320, p.\xc2\xa020, 1465 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S. 85, see 8 CFR \xc2\xa7208.17 (2008).  In his application, Nken claimed he had been persecuted in the past for participation in protests against the Cameroonian Government, and would be subject to further persecution if he returns to Cameroon.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An Immigration Judge denied Nken relief after concluding that he was not credible.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, and also declined to remand for consideration of Nken\xe2\x80\x99s application for adjustment of status based on his marriage to an American citizen.  After the BIA denied a motion to reopen, Nken filed a petition for review of the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s removal order in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  His petition was denied.  Nken then filed a second motion to reopen, which was also denied, followed by a second petition for review, which was denied as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nken filed a third motion to reopen, this time alleging that changed circumstances in Cameroon made his persecution more likely.  The BIA denied the motion, finding that Nken had not presented sufficient facts or evidence of changed country conditions.  Nken again sought review in the Court of Appeals, and also moved to stay his deportation pending resolution of his appeal.  In his motion, Nken recognized that Fourth Circuit precedent required an alien seeking to stay a removal order to show by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the order was \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited as a matter of law,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).  See <em>Teshome-Gebreegziabher</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 528 F. 3d 330 (CA4 2008).  Nken argued, however, that this standard did not govern.  The Court of Appeals denied Nken\xe2\x80\x99s motion without comment.  App. 74.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nken then applied to this Court for a stay of removal pending adjudication of his petition for review, and asked in the alternative that we grant certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on what standard governs a request for such a stay.  Compare <em>Teshome-Gebreegziabher</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 335, and <em>Weng</em> v. <em>U. S. Attorney General</em>, 287 F.\xc2\xa03d 1335 (CA11 2002), with <em>Arevalo</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 344 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (CA1 2003), <em>Mohammed</em> v. <em>Reno</em>, 309 F. 3d 95 (CA2 2002), <em>Douglas</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 374 F. 3d 230 (CA3 2004), <em>Tesfamichael</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 411 F. 3d 169 (CA5 2005), <em>Bejjani</em> v. <em>INS</em>, 271 F. 3d 670 (CA6 2001), <em>Hor</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 400 F. 3d 482 (CA7 2005), and <em>Andreiu</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 253 F.\xc2\xa03d 477 (CA9 2001) (en banc).  We granted certiorari, and stayed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s removal pending further order of this Court.  <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question we agreed to resolve stems from changes in judicial review of immigration procedures brought on by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93546, which substantially amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq</em>.  When Congress passed IIRIRA, it \xe2\x80\x9crepealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in [8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa71105a and instituted a new (and significantly more restrictive) one in 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/471/index.html">525 U. S. 471</a>, 475 (1999)<em> </em>(<em>AAADC</em>).  The new review system substantially limited the availability of judicial review and streamlined all challenges to a removal order into a single proceeding: the petition for review.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2) (barring review of certain removal orders and exercises of executive discretion); \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(C) (establishing strict filing and briefing deadlines for review proceedings); \xc2\xa71252(b)(9) (consolidating challenges into petition for review).  Three changes effected by IIRIRA are of particular importance to this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before IIRIRA, courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the deportation order of an alien who had already left the United States.  See \xc2\xa71105a(c) (1994 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court \xe2\x80\xa6 if [the alien] has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, an alien who appealed a decision of the BIA was typically entitled to remain in the United States for the duration of judicial review.  This was achieved through a provision providing most aliens with an automatic stay of their removal order while judicial review was pending.  See \xc2\xa71105a(a)(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe service of the petition for review \xe2\x80\xa6 shall stay the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition by the court, unless the court otherwise directs\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IIRIRA inverted these provisions to allow for more prompt removal.  First, Congress lifted the ban on adjudication of a petition for review once an alien has departed.  See IIRIRA \xc2\xa7306(b), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93612 (repealing \xc2\xa71105a).  Second, because courts were no longer prohibited from proceeding with review once an alien departed, see <em>Dada</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/1/index.html">554 U. S. 1</a>, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320), Congress repealed the presumption of an automatic stay, and replaced it with the following: \xe2\x80\x9cService of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, IIRIRA restricted the availability of injunctive relief:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLimit on injunctive relief</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) In general</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter, as amended by [IIRIRA], other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) Particular cases</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(f).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis provision, particularly subsection (f)(2), is the source of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreement.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties agree that courts of appeals considering a petition for review of a removal order may prevent that order from taking effect and therefore block removal while adjudicating the petition.  They disagree over the standard a court should apply in deciding whether to do so.  Nken argues that the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d standard for a stay applies.  Under that standard, a court considers four factors: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>Braunskill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/770/index.html">481 U. S. 770</a>, 776 (1987).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government disagrees, arguing that a stay is simply a form of injunction, or alternatively that the relief petitioner seeks is more accurately characterized as injunctive, and therefore that the limits on injunctive relief set forth in subsection (f)(2) apply.  Under that provision, a court may not \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin\xe2\x80\x9d the removal of an alien subject to a final removal order, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.

Nor did the Court consider under what circumstances Congress could deny that authority.  See <em>ibid.</em>  The power to grant a stay pending review, however, was described as part of a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional equipment for the administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  That authority was \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly imbedded in our judicial system,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconsonant with the historic procedures of federal appellate courts,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca power as old as the judicial system of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13, 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The authority to hold an order in abeyance pending review allows an appellate court to act responsibly.  A reviewing court must bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it, but that cannot always be done quickly enough to afford relief to the party aggrieved by the order under review.  The choice for a reviewing court should not be between justice on the fly or participation in what may be an \xe2\x80\x9cidle ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.  The ability to grant interim relief is accordingly not simply \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n historic procedure for preserving rights during the pendency of an appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 15, but also a means of ensuring that appellate courts can responsibly fulfill their role in the judicial process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, a reviewing court may not resolve a conflict between considered review and effective relief by reflexively holding a final order in abeyance pending review.  A stay is an \xe2\x80\x9cintrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Assn.</em> v. <em>Federal Power Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 259 F.\xc2\xa02d 921, 925 (CADC 1958) (<em>per curiam</em>), and accordingly \xe2\x80\x9cis not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Virginian R. Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/658/index.html">272 U. S. 658</a>, 672 (1926).  The parties and the public, while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are also generally entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature has made final.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (f)(2) does not by its terms refer to \xe2\x80\x9cstays\xe2\x80\x9d but instead to the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin the removal of any alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  The parties accordingly begin by disputing whether a stay is simply a type of injunction, covered by the term \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin,\xe2\x80\x9d or a different form of relief.  An injunction and a stay have typically been understood to serve different purposes.  The former is a means by which a court tells someone what to do or not to do.  When a court employs \xe2\x80\x9cthe extraordinary remedy of injunction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Romero-Barcelo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/305/index.html">456 U. S. 305</a>, 312 (1982), it directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 784 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] court order prohibiting someone from doing some specified act or commanding someone to undo some wrong or\ninjury\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n a general sense, every order of a court which commands or forbids is an injunction; but in its accepted legal sense, an injunction is a judicial process or mandate operating <em>in personam.</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 800 (8th ed. 2004) (quoting 1 H. Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating to Injunctions \xc2\xa71, pp. 2\xe2\x80\x933 (1909)).  This is so whether the injunction is preliminary or final; in both contexts, the order is directed at someone, and governs that party\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, instead of directing the conduct of a particular actor, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding itself.  It does so either by halting or postponing some portion of the proceeding, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s, <em>supra</em>, at 1413 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca suspension of the case or some designated proceedings within it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A stay pending appeal certainly has some functional overlap with an injunction, particularly a preliminary one.  Both can have the practical effect of preventing some action before the legality of that action has been conclusively determined.  But a stay achieves this result by temporarily suspending the source of authority to act\xe2\x80\x94the order or judgment in question\xe2\x80\x94not by directing an actor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  A stay \xe2\x80\x9csimply suspend[s] judicial alteration of the status quo,\xe2\x80\x9d while injunctive relief \xe2\x80\x9cgrants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.</em> v. <em>NRC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/1312/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/1312/index.html">479 U.

Although such a stay acts to \xe2\x80\x9cba[r] Executive branch officials from removing [the applicant] from the country,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> post</em>, at 7 (Alito, J., dissenting), it does so by returning to the status quo\xe2\x80\x94the state of affairs before the removal order was entered.<footcall num="*">  That kind of stay, \xe2\x80\x9crelat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</em> v. <em>Mayacamas Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/271/index.html">485 U.

Whether such a stay might technically be called an injunction is beside the point; that is not the label by which it is generally known.  The sun may be a star, but \xe2\x80\x9cstarry sky\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to a bright summer day.  The terminology of subsection (f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that when Congress wanted to refer to a stay pending adjudication of a petition for review in \xc2\xa71252, it used the word \xe2\x80\x9cstay.\xe2\x80\x9d  In subsection (b)(3)(B), under the heading \xe2\x80\x9cStay of order,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress provided that service of a petition for review \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not stay the removal of an alien pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B).  By contrast, the language of subsection (f) says nothing about stays, but is instead titled \xe2\x80\x9cLimit on injunctive relief,\xe2\x80\x9d and refers to the authority of courts to \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin the removal of any alien.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/index.html">480 U. S. 421</a>, 432 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is particularly true here, where subsections (b)(3)(B) and (f)(2) were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering stays of removal, and would have been the natural place to locate an amendment to the traditional standard governing the grant of stays.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, however, Congress placed such a provision four subsections later, in a subsection that makes no mention of stays, next to a provision prohibiting classwide injunctions against the operation of removal provisions.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(f)(1) (permitting injunctions only \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>AAADC</em>, 525 U. S., at 481\xe2\x80\x93482.  Although the dissent \xe2\x80\x9cwould not read too much into Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to locate such a provision in one subsection rather than in another,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 8, the Court frequently takes Congress\xe2\x80\x99s structural choices into consideration when interpreting statutory provisions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Florida Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government counters that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view \xe2\x80\x9cfails to give any operative effect to Section 1252(f)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 32.  Initially, this argument undercuts the Government\xe2\x80\x99s textual reading.  It is one thing to propose that \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (f)(2) covers a broad spectrum of court orders and relief, including both stays and more typical injunctions.  It is quite another to suggest that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin\xe2\x80\x9d to refer <em>exclusively </em>to stays, so that a failure to include stays in subsection (f)(2) would render the provision superfluous. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If nothing else, the terms are by no means synonymous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Leaving that aside, there is something to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s point; the exact role of subsection (f)(2) under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view is not easy to explain.  Congress may have been concerned about the possibility that courts would enjoin application of particular provisions of the INA, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(f)(1) (prohibiting injunctions \xe2\x80\x9cother than with respect to the application of [Section IV of the INA] to an individual alien\xe2\x80\x9d), or about injunctions that might be available under the limited habeas provisions of subsection (e).  Or perhaps subsection (f)(2) was simply included as a catchall provision raising the bar on any availability (even unforeseeable availability) of \xe2\x80\x9cthe extraordinary remedy of injunction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weinberger</em>, 456 U. S., at 312.  In any event, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s point is not enough to outweigh the strong indications that subsection (f)(2) is not reasonably understood to be directed at stays.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the subsection (f)(2) standard to stays pending appeal would not fulfill the historic office of such a stay.  The whole idea is to hold the matter under review in abeyance because the appellate court lacks sufficient time to decide the merits.  Under the subsection (f)(2) standard, however, a stay would only be granted after the court in effect <em>decides </em>the merits, in an expedited manner.  The court would have to do so under a standard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that does not so much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it redundant.  Subsection (f)(2), in short, would invert the customary role of a stay, requiring a definitive merits decision earlier rather than later.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The authority to grant stays has historically been justified by the perceived need \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent irreparable injury to the parties or to the public\xe2\x80\x9d pending review.  <em>Scripps-Howard</em>, 316 U. S., at 9.  Subsection (f)(2) on its face, however, does not allow any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise, even harm that may deprive the movant of his right to petition for review of the removal order.  Subsection (f)(2) does not resolve the dilemma stays historically addressed: what to do when there is insufficient time to resolve the merits and irreparable harm may result from delay.  The provision instead requires deciding the merits under a higher standard, without regard to the prospect of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, applying the subsection (f)(2) standard in the stay context results in something that does not remotely look like a stay.  Just like the Court in <em>Scripps-Howard</em>, we are loath to conclude that Congress would, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary power to stay orders under review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11.  Subsection (f)(2) would certainly deprive courts of their \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary\xe2\x80\x9d stay power.  Our review does not convince us that Congress did that in subsection (f)(2).  The four-factor test is the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d one, <em>Hilton</em>, 481 U. S., at 777, and the Government has not overcome the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Isbrandtsen Co.</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/779/index.html">343 U. S. 779</a>, 783 (1952).  We agree with petitioner that an alien need not satisfy the demanding standard of \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) when asking a court of appeals to stay removal pending judicial review.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So what standard does govern?  The question presented, as noted, offers the alternative of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the traditional test for stays,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 555 U.

See Brief for Respondent 46 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he four-part standard requires a more demanding showing than petitioner suggests\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief for Petitioner 26 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government argues \xe2\x80\xa6 that the [stay] test should be reformulated\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginian R. Co.</em>, 272 U. S., at 672.  It is instead \xe2\x80\x9can exercise of judicial discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 672\xe2\x80\x93673; see <em>Hilton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 777 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he traditional stay factors contemplate individualized judgments in each case\xe2\x80\x9d).  The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/681/index.html">520 U. S. 681</a>, 708 (1997); <em>Landis</em> v. <em>North American Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/248/index.html">299 U. S. 248</a>, 255 (1936).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the issuance of a stay is left to the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mean that no legal standard governs that discretion\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98[A] motion to [a court\xe2\x80\x99s] discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Franklin Capital Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/132/index.html">546 U. S. 132</a>, 139 (2005) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.)).  As noted earlier, those legal principles have been distilled into consideration of four factors: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hilton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 776.  There is substantial overlap between these and the factors governing preliminary injunctions, see <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14); not because the two are one and the same, but because similar concerns arise whenever a court order may allow or disallow anticipated action before the legality of that action has been conclusively determined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two factors of the traditional standard are the most critical.  It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than negligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sofinet</em> v. <em>INS</em>, 188 F.\xc2\xa03d 703, 707 (CA7 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even petitioner acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ore than a mere \xe2\x80\x98possibility\xe2\x80\x99 of relief is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 21 (quoting Brief for Respondent 47).  By the same token, simply showing some \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of irreparable injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Abbassi</em> v. <em>INS</em>, 143 F.\xc2\xa03d 513, 514 (CA9 1998), fails to satisfy the second factor.  As the Court pointed out earlier this Term, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possibility\xe2\x80\x99 standard is too lenient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Winter</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, it is not categorically irreparable, as some courts have said.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ofosu</em> v. <em>McElroy</em>, 98 F. 3d 694, 699 (CA2 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]rdinarily, when a party seeks [a stay] pending appeal, it is deemed that exclusion is an irreparable harm\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Motion for a Stay 12 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he equities particularly favor the alien facing deportation in immigration cases where failure to grant the stay would result in deportation before the alien has been able to obtain judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The automatic stay prior to IIRIRA reflected a recognition of the irreparable nature of harm from removal before decision on a petition for review, given that the petition abated upon removal.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision in IIRIRA to allow continued prosecution of a petition after removal eliminated the reason for categorical stays, as reflected in the repeal of the automatic stay in subsection (b)(3)(B).  It is accordingly plain that the burden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.  Aliens who are removed may continue to pursue their petitions for review, and those who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigration status they had upon removal.  See Brief for Respondent 44.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once an applicant satisfies the first two factors, the traditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest.  These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.  In considering them, courts must be mindful that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s role as the respondent in every removal proceeding does not make the public interest in each individual one negligible, as some courts have concluded.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mohammed</em>, 309 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 102 (Government harm is nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cone alien [being] permitted to remain while an appeal is decided\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ofosu</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 699 (the Government \xe2\x80\x9csuffers no offsetting injury\xe2\x80\x9d in removal cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course there is a public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries where they are likely to face substantial harm.  But that is no basis for the blithe assertion of an \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of any injury to the public interest\xe2\x80\x9d when a stay is granted.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Motion for a Stay 13.  There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders: The continued presence of an alien lawfully deemed removable undermines the streamlined removal proceedings IIRIRA established, and \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>AAADC</em>, 525 U.

The interest in prompt removal may be heightened by the circumstances as well\xe2\x80\x94if, for example, the alien is particularly dangerous, or has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes provided to him.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cPostponing justifiable deportation (in the hope that the alien\xe2\x80\x99s status will change\xe2\x80\x94by, for example, marriage to an American citizen\xe2\x80\x94or simply with the object of extending the alien\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful stay) is often the principal object of resistance to a deportation proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d).  A court asked to stay removal cannot simply assume that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]rdinarily, the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Andreiu</em>, 253 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 484.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did not indicate what standard it applied in denying Nken a stay, but Circuit precedent required the application of \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).

But the relief sought here would simply suspend <em>administrative </em>alteration of the status quo, and we have long recognized that such temporary relief from an administrative order\xe2\x80\x94just like temporary relief from a court order\xe2\x80\x94is considered a stay.  See <em>Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/316/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/316/4/index.html">316 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. for Respondent 42 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the motion to reopen is granted, that vacates the final order of removal and, therefore, there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to which the alien could be removed\xe2\x80\x9d).  The relief sought here is properly termed a \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d because it suspends the effect of the removal order.  </p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962981">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nNKEN V.

This is the less stringent of the two standards at issue.  See <em>Kenyeres</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/1301/index.html">538 U. S. 1301</a>, 1303\xe2\x80\x931305 (2003) (Kennedy, J., in chambers).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems appropriate to underscore that in most cases the debate about which standard should apply will have little practical effect provided the court considering the stay application adheres to the demanding standard set forth.  A stay of removal is an extraordinary remedy that should not be granted in the ordinary case, much less awarded as of right.  <em>Virginian R. Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/658/index.html">272 U. S. 658</a>, 672\xe2\x80\x93673 (1926); see also <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No party has provided the Court with empirical data on the number of stays granted, the correlation between stays granted and ultimate success on the merits, or similar matters.  The statistics would be helpful so that experience can demonstrate whether this decision yields a fair and effective result.  Then, too, Congress can evaluate whether its policy objectives are being realized by the legislation it has enacted.  Based on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s representations at oral argument, however, there are grounds for concern.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not have empirical data, . . . but [stays of removal] are\xe2\x80\x94in the Ninth Circuit in our experience\xe2\x80\x94 . . . granted quite frequently\xe2\x80\x9d).  This concern is of particular importance in those Circuits with States on our international borders.  The Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, for example, considers over half of all immigration petitions filed nationwide, and immigration cases compose nearly half of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s docket.  See Catterson, Symposium, Ninth Circuit Conference: Changes in Appellate Caseload and Its Processing, 48 Ariz. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 287, 297 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under either standard, even the less stringent standard the Court adopts today, courts should not grant stays of removal on a routine basis.  The passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93546, reinforces this point.  Before IIRIRA, aliens who left the United States no longer had the ability to seek review of their removal orders, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a(c) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996), so they could more easily have established irreparable harm due to their removal.  It is perhaps for this reason Congress decided to \xe2\x80\x9cstay the deportation of [an] alien pending determination of the petition by the court, unless the court otherwise direct[ed].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71105a(a)(3) (same).  IIRIRA, however, removed that prohibition (as well as the automatic stay provision), and courts may now review petitions after aliens have been removed.  See Brief for Respondent 44; <em>ante</em>, at 4, 15; <em>post</em>, at 5, 9 (Alito, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This change should mean that obtaining a stay of removal is more difficult.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s four-part standard, the alien must show both irreparable injury and a likelihood of success on the merits, in addition to establishing that the interests of the parties and the public weigh in his or her favor.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  As the Court explains, because aliens may continue to seek review and obtain relief after removal, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  As a result of IIRIRA there must be a particularized, irreparable harm beyond mere removal to justify a stay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not to say that demonstration of irreparable harm, without more, is sufficient to justify a stay of removal.  The Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginian R. Co., supra</em>, at 672.  When considering success on the merits and irreparable harm, courts cannot dispense with the required showing of one simply because there is a strong likelihood of the other.  This is evident in the decisions of Justices of the Court applying the traditional factors.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Curry</em> v. <em>Baker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/1301/index.html">479 U. S. 1301</a>, 1302 (1986) (Powell, J., in chambers) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no doubt true that, absent [a stay], the applicant here will suffer irreparable injury.  This fact alone is not sufficient to justify a stay\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ruckelshaus</em> v. <em>Monsanto Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1315/index.html">463 U. S. 1315</a>, 1317 (1983) (Blackmun, J., in chambers) (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]ikelihood of success on the merits need not be considered \xe2\x80\xa6 if the applicant fails to show irreparable injury from the denial of the stay\xe2\x80\x9d).  As those decisions make clear, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the applicant must meet a heavy burden of showing not only that the judgment of the lower court was erroneous on the merits, but also that the applicant will suffer irreparable injury if the judgment is not stayed pending his appeal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Zbaraz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/1309/index.html">442 U.

I would give effect to that provision, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When an alien is charged with being removable from the United States, an Immigration Judge (IJ) conducts a hearing, receives and considers evidence, and determines whether the alien is removable.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(a); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71240.1(a)(1)(i), (c) (2008).  If the IJ enters an order of removal, that order becomes final when the alien\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) is unsuccessful or the alien declines to appeal to the Board.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(47)(B); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71241.1, 1241.31.  Once an order of removal has become final, it may be executed at any time.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71231(a)(1)(B)(i), 1252(b)(8)(C); 8 CFR \xc2\xa71241.33.  Removal orders \xe2\x80\x9care self-executing orders, not dependent upon judicial enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stone </em>v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/386/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/386/index.html">514 U. S. 386</a>, 398 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the removal order is final and enforceable, the alien may file a motion to reopen before the IJ, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7), or a petition for review before the appropriate court of appeals, see \xc2\xa71252(a)(1).  While either challenge is pending, the alien may ask the Executive Branch to stay its own hand.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7241.6(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 1241.6(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  If, however, the alien wants <em>a court</em> to restrain the Executive from executing a final and enforceable removal order, the alien must seek an injunction to do so.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(1) (making a final order of removal subject to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72349(b), which provides that an \xe2\x80\x9cinterlocutory injunction\xe2\x80\x9d can \xe2\x80\x9crestrain\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cexecution of\xe2\x80\x9d a final order).  The plain text of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93546, provides the relevant legal standard for granting such relief: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.

Petitioner appealed to the Board, and on June 16, 2006, the Board affirmed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9349.  On that date, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s order of removal became administratively final, and the Executive Branch became legally entitled to remove him from the United States.  See 8 U.

When an alien subject to a final order of removal seeks to bar executive officials from acting upon that order pending judicial consideration of a petition for review, the alien is seeking to \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin\xe2\x80\x9d his or her removal.

This Court should interpret it accordingly.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IIRIRA was designed to expedite removal and restrict the ability of aliens to remain in this country pending judicial review.  Before IIRIRA, the filing of a petition for review automatically stayed removal unless the court of appeals directed otherwise.  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a(a)(3) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996).  IIRIRA repealed this provision and, to drive home the point, specifically provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ervice of the petition [for judicial review] . . . <em>does not</em> stay the removal of an alien pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).  In addition, \xe2\x80\x9cmany provisions of IIRIRA are aimed at protecting the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s discretion from the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/471/index.html">525 U.

Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cprotecting the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s discretion from the courts . . . can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Section 1252(f)(2), which provides that a court may not block removal during the judicial review process unless a heightened standard is met, fits perfectly within this scheme.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, by contrast, produces anomalous results.  If \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) does not provide the standard to be used by the courts in determining whether an alien should be permitted to remain in this country pending judicial review, then IIRIRA left the formulation of that standard entirely to the discretion of the courts.  A Congress that sought to expedite removal and limit judicial discretion is unlikely to have taken that approach.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More important, if \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) does not set the standard for blocking removal pending judicial review, then, as the Court concedes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe exact role of subsection (f)(2) . . . is not easy to explain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Sonotone Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/index.html">442 U. S. 330</a>, 339 (1979).  We should not lightly conclude that Congress enacted a provision that serves no function, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-technical distinction between an injunction and a stay does not provide a sufficient justification for adopting an interpretation that renders \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) meaningless.  That result is particularly anomalous in the context of \xc2\xa71252(f)(2), which Congress said should apply \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, if stays and injunctions really are two entirely distinct concepts, the order that petitioner sought here is best viewed as an injunction.  Insofar as there is a difference between the two concepts, I agree with the Court that it boils down to this: \xe2\x80\x9cA stay \xe2\x80\x98simply suspend[s] judicial alteration of the status quo,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whereas an injunction \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (quoting <em>Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.</em> v. <em>NRC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/1312/index.html">479 U. S. 1312</a>, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers)).  See also Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1413 (defining a stay as an \xe2\x80\x9cact of arresting a judicial proceeding by the order of a court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, petitioner did not seek an order \xe2\x80\x9csuspend[ing] judicial alteration of the status quo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, he sought an order barring Executive branch officials from removing him from the country.  Such an order is best viewed as an injunction.  See <em>McCarthy </em>v.<em> Briscoe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/1317/index.html">429 U. S. 1317</a>, 1317, n.\xc2\xa01 (1976) (Powell, J., in chambers) (although applicants claimed to seek a \xe2\x80\x9cstay,\xe2\x80\x9d the court granted an \xe2\x80\x9cinjunction\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicants actually [sought] affirmative relief\xe2\x80\x9d against executive officials).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if petitioner had sought to block his removal pending judicial review of the order of removal, any interim order blocking his removal would best be termed an injunction.  When the Board affirmed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s final removal order in 2006, it gave the Executive Branch all of the legal authority it needed to remove petitioner from the United States immediately.  An order preventing an executive officer from exercising that authority does not \xe2\x80\x9csimply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1313.  Instead, such an order is most properly termed an injunction because it blocks executive officials from carrying out what they view as proper enforcement of the immigration laws.  And in that regard, it is significant that the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x94which governs judicial review under IIRIRA, see 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94refers to an \xe2\x80\x9capplication for an <em>interlocutory injunction</em> restraining or suspending the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside\xe2\x80\x9d a final administrative order.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72349(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, however, petitioner did not seek to block his removal pending judicial review of his final order of removal.  That review concluded long ago.  What petitioner asked for was an order barring the Executive Branch from removing him pending judicial review of an entirely different order, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s order denying his third motion to reopen the proceedings.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s current petition for review does not contest the correctness of the removal order.  Rather, he argues that the Board should have set aside that order due to alleged changes in conditions in his home country.  A motion to reopen an administrative proceeding that is no longer subject to direct judicial review surely seeks \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an order <em>altering</em> the status quo.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9 (quoting <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/1301/index.html">507 U.

Consequently, the relief that petitioner sought here is best categorized as an\ninjunction.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to its highly technical distinction between an injunction and a stay, the Court advances several other justifications for its decision, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court argues that applying 8 U.

And Congress is free to regulate or eliminate the relief that federal courts may award, within constitutional limits that the Court does not invoke here.  Cf. <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 299\xe2\x80\x93300 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court opines that subsection (b)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x94not subsection (f)(2)\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural place to locate an amendment to the traditional standard governing the grant of stays.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But I would not read too much into Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to locate such a provision in one subsection rather than in another subsection of the same provision.  In addition, there is also nothing \xe2\x80\x9cunnatural\xe2\x80\x9d about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of two separate subsections of \xc2\xa71252 to address a common subject.  For example, \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(A) lists several matters over which \xe2\x80\x9cno court shall have jurisdiction to review,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xc2\xa71252(g) lists another subject over which \xe2\x80\x9cno court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that those provisions are separated by five subsections and framed in slightly different terms does not justify ignoring them, just as the space and difference in terminology between \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) and \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) cannot justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Noting that the term \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d is used in \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) but not in \xc2\xa71252(f)(2), the Court infers that Congress did not intend that the latter provision apply to stays.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(3)(B) is easy to explain.  As noted above, prior to IIRIRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act provided for an automatic \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d of deportation upon the filing of a petition for review unless the court of appeals directed otherwise.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a(a)(3) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996).  The statute provided: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe service of the petition for review upon [the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s agents] shall <em>stay </em>the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition by the court \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the court otherwise directs \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p align="left">\nIn IIRIRA, Congress repealed that provision and, to make sure that the pre-IIRIRA practice would not be continued, enacted a new provision that explicitly inverted the prior rule:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cService of the petition on the officer or employee does not <em>stay</em> the removal of an alien pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt is thus apparent that \xc2\xa71252(b)(3)(B) uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d because that is the term that was used in the provision that it replaced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court worries that applying \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) would create inequitable results by allowing removable aliens to remain in the United States only if they can prove the merits of their claims under a \xe2\x80\x9chigher standard\xe2\x80\x9d than the one they would otherwise have to satisfy.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But as the Court acknowledges, <em>ante</em>, at 4, IIRIRA specifically contemplated that most aliens wishing to contest final orders of removal would be forced to pursue their appeals from abroad.  See \xc2\xa7306(b), 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93612 (repealing 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a (1994 ed.)).  If such an alien seeks to remain in the United States pending judicial review, IIRIRA provides that the alien must make the heightened showing required under \xc2\xa71252(f)(2).  Congress did not think that this scheme is inequitable, and we must heed what \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) prescribes.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the Fourth Circuit was correct to apply \xc2\xa71252(f)(2) and to deny petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s application for an order barring his removal pending judicial review.  Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Thus, it is unremarkable that we have used the word \xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d to describe an injunction blocking an administrative order pending judicial review.
