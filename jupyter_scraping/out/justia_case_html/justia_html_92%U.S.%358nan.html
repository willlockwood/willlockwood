CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We have no jurisdiction in this case.  Writs of error and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 92 U. S. 361</a></p><p> appeals lie to this Court from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana only in cases where the value of the property or the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $1,000, and from decision upon writs of habeas corpus involving the question of personal freedom.  Rev.Stat., sec. 1909.</p>\n<p>In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/46/103/case.html#120">Barry v. Mercien,</a></span></em> 5 How. 120, it was held, Chief Justice Taney speaking for the Court, that, in order to give us jurisdiction in a case dependent upon the amount in controversy, "the matter in dispute must be money, or some right, the value of which in money can be calculated and ascertained."  This rule has been followed in many cases.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/66/273/case.html">Pratt v. Fitzhugh,</a></span></em> 1 Black 273; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/67/704/case.html#714">De Krafft v. Barry,</a></span></em> 2 Black 714.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the contest is not for money, or any right the value of which can be measured by money.  The petitioners, to show that they have such a special interest in the question presented for adjudication as entitles them to commence and maintain the action, allege that they are attorneys and counselors at law, and that, by the removal of the seat of government from Helena to Virginia City, their expenses will be increased while in attendance upon the courts pursuant to their professional engagements.  But this is not the matter in controversy.  The contest is as to the validity of certain proceedings for the removal of the seat of government for the territory.  The interest which the petitioners have in that contest is not in any sense property.  Besides, they do not complain.</p>\n<p>The defendants, who are the plaintiffs in the error here, do not claim to be personally interested pecuniarily in the litigation.  They only state in their answer that if a removal is had, the United States will be put to an expense of $3,000.  But in this proceeding they do not represent the United States.  They are government officials, but they do not appear here in their official capacity.  By a law of the territory, it has been made their duty to canvass the votes cast at a territorial election.  In this they act for the people of the territory, and not for the United States.  They derive all their authority for this purpose from a law of the territory, and not from a law of Congress.  If a judgment is given against them, they will not lose any money; neither will the petitioners gain any from them.</p>\n<p><em>Writ dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
