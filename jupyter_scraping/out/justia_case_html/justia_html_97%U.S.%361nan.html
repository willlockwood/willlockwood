Salamon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/434/case.html">94 U.

After the mandate was filed in the circuit court, Stewart and Cutts petitioned for leave to file a plea of <em>lis pendens</em> and an amended answer to the original bill.  The petition having been overruled, and a final decree entered in accordance with the mandate, they appealed here.  The appellees now move to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>An appeal will not be entertained by this Court from a decree </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 97 U. S. 362</a></p><p> entered in the circuit or other inferior court in exact accordance with our mandate upon a previous appeal.  Such a decree, when entered, is in effect our decree, and the appeal would be from ourselves to ourselves.  If such an appeal is taken, however, we will, upon the application of the appellee, examine the decree entered, and if it conforms to the mandate, dismiss the case with costs.  If it does not, the case will be remanded with appropriate directions for the correction of the error.  The same rule applies to writs of error.  This is not intended to interfere with any remedy the parties may have by mandamus.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from a decree entered upon our mandate.  No complaint is made as to its form, and it seems to be in all respects according to our directions.  The effort of the appellant was to open the case below and to obtain leave to file new pleadings, introducing new defenses.  This he could not do.  The rights of the parties in the subject matter of the suit were finally determined upon the original appeal, and all that remained for the circuit court to do was to enter a decree in accordance with our instructions and carry it into effect.  If in the progress of the execution of the decree, after its entry, either party is aggrieved, he may appeal from the final decree in that behalf; but such an appeal will bring up for reexamination only the proceedings subsequent to the mandate.</p>\n<p>The appeal will be dismissed with costs, and it is</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Second appeals or writs of error, as the case may be, will lie in certain cases where it is alleged that the mandate of the appellate court has not been properly executed, but the appeal or writ of error in such a case will bring up nothing for reexamination except the proceedings subsequent to the mandate.  Needful explanations may be derived from the original record, but the reexamination cannot extend to any thing that was decided in the antecedent appeal or writ of error.  <em>The Lady Pike,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/461/case.html">96 U.

Consequently, in a case which comes here from a state court, it must appear by the record that some one of the questions stated in that section arose in the court below, and that it was determined as there required, otherwise this Court is wholly without jurisdiction, and can only dismiss the writ of error.</p>\n<p>Unlike that, if the case is brought up from a circuit court by writ of error or appeal, it is the writ of error or appeal which gives this Court jurisdiction, and if the proceedings in bringing up the case are correct, the jurisdiction of the Court is beyond question, and by the express words of the section the Supreme Court must reverse or affirm.  1 Stat. 84; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/67/481/case.html#484">Taylor v. Morton,</a></span></em> 2 Black 484.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any alteration of that provision in that regard, except that the appellate court may affirm, modify, or reverse the judgment, the rule still being that it is the writ of error or appeal in such cases that gives the jurisdiction, and that the appellate court can only affirm, modify, or reverse the judgment, or decree where there is no error in bringing up the case.  17 Stat. 147.</p>\n<p>Reported cases almost without number decide that a case regularly brought up under the twenty-second section of the Judiciary Act cannot be dismissed because the record presents no question for reexamination, the universal rule being that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 97 U. S. 364</a></p><p> the plaintiff or appellant is entitled to be heard in order that he may show, if he can, that the error of which he complains appears in the record, and whether it does so appear or not cannot be inquired into in the form of a motion to dismiss.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/42/287/case.html">Minor v.

Nor is anything of the kind pretended.  Instead of that, the only objection is that it is a second appeal, which is not a valid objection.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
