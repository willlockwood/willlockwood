Two and a half years later, the Federal District Court ruled against Artis on her sole federal claim and dismissed the D.\xc2\xa0C.-law claims under \xc2\xa71367(c).  Fifty-nine days after the dismissal, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Superior Court, but that court dismissed them as time barred.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that \xc2\xa71367(d) accorded Artis only a 30-day grace period to refile in state court and rejecting her argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71367(d) means that the limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Section 1367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, <i>i.e., </i>to stop the clock.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.  First, the period of limitations may be \xe2\x80\x9ctolled,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>suspended, while the claim is pending elsewhere; the time clock starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  A legislature may instead elect simply to provide a grace period, permitting the statute of limitations to run while the claim is pending in another forum and averting the risk of a time bar by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  The District has identified no federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d or any word similarly rooted.  And the one case in which this Court used tolling language to describe a grace period, see <i>Hardin</i> v. <i>Straub</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536\n, is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \xe2\x80\x9ctolling\xe2\x80\x9d a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Considering first the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, \xc2\xa71367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations both while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation is a natural fit with this language.  The District, in contrast, reads \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d to mean to remove, temporarily, the bar that would ordinarily accompany the expiration of the limitations period.  But the District offers no reason to home in only on the word \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d itself and ignore information about the verb\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object, \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  That object sheds light on what it means to \xe2\x80\x9cbe tolled.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District\xe2\x80\x99s reading also tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d; makes the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim\xe2\x80\x99s pendency in federal court, superfluous; and could yield an absurdity, permitting a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Congress adopted an American Law Institute (ALI) recommendation to allow refiling in state court only for 30 days after a dismissal.  The ALI provision, like \xc2\xa71367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, but it did not provide for tolling \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the [state] claim is pending\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The 30-day provision casts no large shadow on Artis\xe2\x80\x99 stop-the-clock interpretation.  The provision accounts for cases in which a plaintiff commenced a federal action close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations, by giving such a plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.  Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>\n\n46 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa753911.  Section 1367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s proviso \xe2\x80\x9cunless State law provides for a longer tolling period\xe2\x80\x9d could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The stop-the-clock interpretation of \xc2\xa71367(d) does not present a serious constitutional problem.  In <i>Jinks</i> v. <i>Richland County</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 456\n, the Court rejected an argument that \xc2\xa71367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 464\xe2\x80\x93465.  The District contends that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \xe2\x80\x9cno federal purpose\xe2\x80\x9d that could not be served by a grace-period prescription.  But both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 discretion than this Court has countenanced.  A concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription may also be more theoretical than real.  Finally, a stop-the-clock rule like \xc2\xa71367(d) is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preventing surprises\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to defendants and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr.

Included within this supplemental jurisdiction are state claims brought along with federal claims arising from the same episode.  When district courts dismiss all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, they ordinarily dismiss as well all related state claims.  See \xc2\xa71367(c)(3).  A district court may also dismiss the related state claims if there is a good reason to decline jurisdiction.  See \xc2\xa71367(c)(1), (2), and (4).  This case concerns the time within which state claims so dismissed may be refiled in state court.</p><p>Section 1367(d), addressing that issue, provides:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe period of limitations for any [state] claim [\xc2\xa0joined with a claim within federal-court competence] shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The question presented: Does the word \xe2\x80\x9ctolled,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa71367(d), mean the state limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit; or does \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d mean that, although the state limitations period continues to run, a plaintiff is accorded a grace period of 30 days to refile in state court post dismissal of the federal case?  Petitioner urges the first, or stop-the-clock, reading.  Respondent urges, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted, the second, or grace-period, reading.</p><p>In the case before us, plaintiff-petitioner Stephanie C. Artis refiled her state-law claims in state court 59 days after dismissal of her federal suit.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  Reading \xc2\xa71367(d) as a grace-period prescription, her complaint would be time barred.  Reading \xc2\xa71367(d) as stopping the limitations clock during the pendency of the federal-court suit, her complaint would be timely.  We hold that \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, <i>i.e., </i>to stop the clock.  Because the D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals held that \xc2\xa71367(d) did not stop the D.\xc2\xa0C.

The House Report accompanying the Act explains that Congress sought to clarify the scope of federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to hear claims within their supplemental jurisdiction, appreciating that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]upplemental jurisdiction has enabled federal courts and litigants to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. deal economically\xe2\x80\x94in single rather than multiple litigation\xe2\x80\x94with related matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

If the state court would hold the claim time barred, however, then, absent a curative provision, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the state-law claim without prejudice would be tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.  See, <i>e.g., Carnegie-Mellon Univ.</i> v. <i>Cohill</i>,484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343,352 (1988) (under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, if the statute of limitations on state-law claims expires before the federal court \xe2\x80\x9crelinquish[es] jurisdiction[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a dismissal will foreclose the plaintiff from litigating his claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  To prevent that result, \xc2\xa71367(d) supplies \xe2\x80\x9ca tolling rule that must be applied by state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jinks</i>, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 459.

In November 2010, Artis was told she would lose her job.  Thirteen months later, Artis sued the District in the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that she had suffered employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,78Stat.253, as amended,42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>  She also asserted three allied claims under D.\xc2\xa0C. law: retaliation in violation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Act, D.\xc2\xa0C.

Artis alleged that she had been subjected to gender discrimination by her supervisor, and thereafter encountered retaliation for reporting the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful activities.  See <i>Artis</i> v. <i>District of Columbia</i>, 51 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 135, 137 (2014).</p><p>On June 27, 2014, the District Court granted the District\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim.  Having dismissed Artis\xe2\x80\x99 sole federal claim, the District Court, pursuant to \xc2\xa71367(c)(3), declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state-law claims.  \xe2\x80\x9cArtis will not be prejudiced,\xe2\x80\x9d the court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(d) provides for a tolling of the statute of limitations during the period the case was here and for at least 30 days thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 142.</p><p>Fifty-nine days after the dismissal of her federal action, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D.\xc2\xa0C. Superior Court, the appropriate local court.  The Superior Court granted the District\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, holding that Artis\xe2\x80\x99 claims were time barred, because they were filed 29 days too late.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.  When Artis first asserted her state-law claims in the District Court, nearly two years remained on the applicable three-year statute of limitations.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  But two and a half years passed before the federal court relinquished jurisdiction.  Unless \xc2\xa71367(d) paused the limitations clock during that time, Artis would have had only 30 days to refile.  The Superior Court rejected Artis\xe2\x80\x99 stop-the-clock reading of \xc2\xa71367(d), reasoning that Artis could have protected her state-law claims by \xe2\x80\x9cpursuing [them] in a state court while the federal court proceeding [was] pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In tension with that explanation, the court noted that duplicative filings in federal and state court are \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally disfavored .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as \xe2\x80\x98wasteful\xe2\x80\x99 and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98against [the interests of] judicial efficiency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 14a, n.\xc2\xa01 (quoting <i>Stevens</i> v. <i>Arco Management of Wash.

That court began by observing that two \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting approaches [to \xc2\xa71367(d)] have evolved nationally\xe2\x80\x9d: the stop-the-clock reading and the grace-period reading.  135 A.\xc2\xa03d 334, 337 (2016).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  Without further comment on \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the D.\xc2\xa0C.

This dictionary definition captures the rule generally applied in federal courts.

When that mode is adopted, the statute of limitations continues to run while the claim is pending in another forum.  But the risk of a time bar is averted by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  A federal statute of that genre is28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72415.  That provision prescribes a six-year limitations period for suits seeking money damages from the United States for breach of contract.  \xc2\xa72415(a).

Nor has the dissent, for all its mighty strivings, identified even one federal statute that fits its bill, <i>i.e., </i>a federal statute that says \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d but means something other than \xe2\x80\x9csuspended,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpaused,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstopped.\xe2\x80\x9d  From what statutory text, then, does the dissent start?  See <i>post, </i>at 5.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  </p><p>Turning from statutory texts to judicial decisions, only once did an opinion of this Court employ tolling language to describe a grace period: <i>Hardin</i> v. <i>Straub</i>,490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536 (1989).  In <i>Hardin</i>, we held that, in42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 suits, federal courts should give effect to state statutes sheltering claims from time bars during periods of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s legal disability.  We there characterized a state statute providing a one-year grace period as \xe2\x80\x9ctolling\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csuspend[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the limitations period \xe2\x80\x9cuntil one year after the disability has been removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 537.  This atypical use of \xe2\x80\x9ctolling\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csuspending\xe2\x80\x9d to mean something other than stopping the clock on a limitations period is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \xe2\x80\x9ctolling\xe2\x80\x9d a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.</p><p>B</p><p>In determining the meaning of a statutory provision, \xe2\x80\x9cwe look first to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Moskal</i> v. <i>United States</i>,498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations for two adjacent time periods: while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis urges that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be tolled\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71367(d) has the same meaning it does in the statutes cited <i>supra,</i> at 7, n.\xc2\xa04.  That is, the limitations clock stops the day the claim is filed in federal court and, 30 days postdismissal, restarts from the point at which it had stopped.</p><p>The District reads \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s purposes differently.  To \xe2\x80\x9ctoll,\xe2\x80\x9d the District urges, means to \xe2\x80\x9cremove or take away an effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  To \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d a limitations period, then, would mean to \xe2\x80\x9cremov[e] the bar that ordinarily would accompany its expiration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 14.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is nothing special,\xe2\x80\x9d the District maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cabout tolling limitations periods versus tolling any other fact, right, or consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 13.  But the District offers no reason why, in interpreting \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa71367(d), we should home in only on the word itself, ignoring the information about the verb\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object.  Just as when the object of \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cbell\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chighway traveler,\xe2\x80\x9d the object \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d sheds light on what it means to \xe2\x80\x9cbe tolled.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>The District\xe2\x80\x99s reading, largely embraced by the dissent, is problematic for other reasons as well.  First, it tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the District\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect of the period of limitations as a time bar.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.</i>, at 18 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 1367(d) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. provides that \xe2\x80\x98the period of limitations\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94here its effect as a time bar\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98shall be [removed or taken away] while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (alterations in original)).  Second, the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim\xe2\x80\x99s pendency in federal court, becomes superfluous under the District\xe2\x80\x99s construction.  The \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d of the limitations period as a time bar, on the District\xe2\x80\x99s reading, becomes operative only after the case has been dismissed.  That being so, what need would there be to remove anything while the claim is pending in federal court?</p><p>Furthermore, the District\xe2\x80\x99s reading could yield an absurdity: It could permit a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  To avoid that result, the District\xe2\x80\x99s proposed construction of \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cremoved\xe2\x80\x9d could not mean simply \xe2\x80\x9cremoved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cremoved\xe2\x80\x9d would require qualification to express \xe2\x80\x9cremoved, unless the period of limitations expired before the claim was filed in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  In sum, the District\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation maps poorly onto the language of \xc2\xa71367(d), while Artis\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation is a natural fit.</p><p>C</p><p>The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals adopted the District\xe2\x80\x99s grace-period construction primarily because it was convinced that in drafting \xc2\xa71367(d), Congress embraced an ALI recommendation.  135 A.\xc2\xa03d, at 338.  Two decades before the enactment of \xc2\xa71367(d), the ALI, in its 1969 Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, did recommend a 30-day grace period for refiling certain claims.  The ALI proposed the following statutory language:</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf any claim in an action timely commenced in a federal court is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim, a new action on the same claim brought in another court shall not be barred by a statute of limitations that would not have barred the original action had it been commenced in that court, if such new action is brought in a proper court, federal or State, within thirty days after dismissal of the original claim has become final or within such longer period as may be available under applicable State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts \xc2\xa71386(b), p. 65 (1969) (ALI Study).</p><p>Congress, however, did not adopt the ALI\xe2\x80\x99s grace-period formulation.  Instead, it ordered tolling of the state limitations period \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the claim is pending\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  Although the provision the ALI proposed, like \xc2\xa71367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, it did not provide for tolling the period of limitations while a claim is pending.[<a href="#F10">10</a>]  True, the House Report contained a citation to the ALI Study, but only in reference to a different provision,28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391 (the general venue statute).  There, Congress noted that its approach was \xe2\x80\x9ctaken from the ALI Study.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 23.  Had Congress similarly embraced the ALI\xe2\x80\x99s grace-period formulation in \xc2\xa71367(d), one might expect the House Report to have said as much.[<a href="#F11">11</a>]</p><p>D</p><p>The District asks us to zero in on \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexpress inclusion\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of 30 days after the claim is dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d within the tolling period.  Brief for Respondent 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under Artis\xe2\x80\x99 stop-the-clock interpretation, the District contends, \xe2\x80\x9cthe inclusion of 30 days within the tolling period would be relegated to insignificance in the mine-run of cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In \xc2\xa71367(d), Congress did provide for tolling not only while the claim is pending in federal court, but also for 30 days thereafter.  Including the 30 days within \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s tolling period accounts for cases in which a federal action is commenced close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations.  In such a case, the added days give the plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.</p><p>Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  In this respect, \xc2\xa71367(d) closely resembles46 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa753911, which provides, in a subsection titled \xe2\x80\x9cTolling of limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d that if a plaintiff submits a claim for war-related vessel damage to the Secretary of Transportation, \xe2\x80\x9cthe running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa753911(d).  Numerous other statutes similarly append a fixed number of days to an initial tolling period.  See, <i>e.g.,</i>22 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71631k(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cStatutes of limitations on assessments .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be suspended with respect to any vested property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. while vested and for six months thereafter.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d);26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76213(f\xc2\xa0)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn any case under title 11 of the United States Code, the running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to any deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited by reason of such case from filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa76503(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe running of the period of limitations provided in section 6501 or 6502 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and for 60 days thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d);50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74000(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe running of a statute of limitations against the collection of tax deferred under this section .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be suspended for the period of military service of the servicemember and for an addi- tional period of 270 days thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9c30 days\xe2\x80\x9d provision casts no large shadow on Artis\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation.</p><p>Section 1367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s proviso, \xe2\x80\x9cunless State law provides for a longer tolling period,\xe2\x80\x9d could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  She would have the benefit of \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s 30-days-to-refile prescription, or such longer time as state law prescribes.[<a href="#F12">12</a>]  It may be that, in most cases, the state-law tolling period will not be longer than \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s.  But in some cases it undoubtedly will.  For example, Indiana permits a plaintiff to refile within three years of dismissal.  See Ind. Code \xc2\xa734\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x931 (2017).  And Louisiana provides that after dismissal the limitations period \xe2\x80\x9cruns anew.\xe2\x80\x9d  La. Civ. Code Ann., Arts. 3462, 3466 (West 2007).</p><p>III</p><p>Satisfied that Artis\xe2\x80\x99 text-based arguments overwhelm the District\xe2\x80\x99s, we turn to the District\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the stop-the-clock interpretation of \xc2\xa71367(d) raises a significant constitutional question: Does the statute exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18, because its connection to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers is too attenuated or because it is too great an incursion on the States\xe2\x80\x99 domain?  Brief for Respondent 46\xe2\x80\x9349.  To avoid constitutional doubt, the District urges, we should adopt its reading.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here an alternative interpretation of [a] statute is fairly possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the District reminds, we have construed legislation in a manner that \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[s] [serious constitutional] problems\xe2\x80\x9d raised by \xe2\x80\x9can otherwise acceptable construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>INS</i> v. <i>St. Cyr</i>,533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289\xe2\x80\x93300 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even if we regarded the District\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71367(d) as \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible,\xe2\x80\x9d our precedent would undermine the proposition that \xc2\xa71367(d) presents a serious constitutional problem.

Brief for Respondent 49.  Both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.

ARTIS, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</p><p>on writ of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals</p><p>[January 22, 2018]</p><p>Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.</p><p>Chesterton reminds us not to clear away a fence just because we cannot see its point.  Even if a fence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a reason, sometimes all that means is we need to look more carefully for the reason it was built in the first place.</p><p>The same might be said about the law before us.  Section 1367(d) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he period of limitations .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\xe2\x80\x9d28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367(d).  Grown from a rich common law and state statutory tradition, this provision serves a modest role.  If a federal court dismisses a party\xe2\x80\x99s state law claim without ruling on its merits, the law ensures the party will enjoy whatever time state law allows, or at least 30 days, to refile the claim in state court.</p><p>Today the Court clears away this traditional rule because it overlooks the original reasons for it.  For the first time in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history the Court now reads the law to guarantee parties not 30 days or whatever state law permits but months or years more to refile their dismissed state law claims in state court.  Rather than reading the statute as generally deferring to state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims brought in state courts, the Court now reads the statute as generally displacing them in favor of a new federal rule.  Indeed, the Court today tells state courts that they must routinely disregard clearly expressed state law defining the appropriate length of time parties should have to sue on state law claims in state tribunals.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule, too, the disregard of state limitations law promises to be not only routine but substantial.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach will require state courts to entertain state law claims that state law deems untimely not only by weeks or months but by many years, as 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments warn us.  And the Court demands all this without offering any rational account why it is necessary or proper to the exercise of one of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s limited and enumerated powers.  It may only be a small statute we are interpreting, but the result the Court reaches today represents no small intrusion on traditional state functions and no small departure from our foundational principles of federalism.  Respectfully, I dissent.</p><p>Start with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s key term.  Where, as here, a law instructs us to \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d a limitations period, we know it may be telling us to do one of (at least) two different things.  The dictionary informs that to \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul\xe2\x80\x9d); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9ctollere,\xe2\x80\x9d the Latin origin, means to \xe2\x80\x9cremove\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clift\xe2\x80\x9d).  So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean <i>either </i>that the running of the limitations period is suspended <i>or </i>that the effect of the limitations period is defeated.  The first understanding stops the limitations clock running until a specified event begins it running again: call it the stop clock approach.  The second understanding allows the limitations clock to continue to run but defeats the effect of the clock\xe2\x80\x99s expiration for an additional specified period of time: call it the grace period approach.</p><p>That both of these understandings of the word \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d are indeed possible and in fact historically common this Court has already explained in <i>Chardon</i> v. <i>Fumero Soto</i>,462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 650 (1983):</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Tolling effect\xe2\x80\x99 refers to the method of calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.  The statute of limitations <i>might merely be suspended</i>; if so, the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  <i>It is also possible to establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, </i>without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 652, n.\xc2\xa01 (emphasis added).</p><p>When it comes to federal law today, <i>Chardon</i> has further explained, both kinds of tolling can be found.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]ome federal statutes provide for suspension\xe2\x80\x9d of the running of the limitations period, or the stop clock approach, while \xe2\x80\x9cother statutes establish a variety of different tolling effects,\xe2\x80\x9d including grace periods for refiling after dismissal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 660, n. 13.</p><p>Neither is it a surprise that <i>Chardon</i> acknowledged tolling statutes might come in (at least) these two varieties.  At common law, both types of tolling were well and long known, if often employed in different circumstances to address different problems in equitably tailored ways.</p><p>Take the stop clock approach.  While any generalization is subject to its exceptions, the stop clock approach was often used at common law to suspend a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s duty to bring a timely lawsuit if, and for the period, the plaintiff was prevented from coming to court due to some disability.  And this common law rule made common sense in those circumstances.  After all, if (say) a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fraud prevented the plaintiff from discovering his injury, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to see why the limitations clock should stop running until the fraud is revealed and the disability thus dissipated.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>By contrast, the grace period approach was commonly used in cases where, as here, the plaintiff made it to court in time but arrived in the wrong court and had to refile in the right one.  In this situation, equity didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily call for suspending the running of the limitations period for whatever arbitrary period of time\xe2\x80\x94weeks or months or years\xe2\x80\x94the suit happened to sit in court before dismissal.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the defendant or uncontrollable circumstances had conspired to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding during that period.  Instead, the law commonsensically held that in these circumstances a grace period would suffice to allow the plaintiff a brief time to find his way to and refile in the correct court.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>Indeed, grace periods appear to find their roots in a common law rule known as the \xe2\x80\x9cjourney\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x9d that expressly sought to account for and afford to a dismissed party \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of days which [he] must spend in journeying to the court\xe2\x80\x9d to refile his claim.  37 C.\xc2\xa0J., Limitations of Actions \xc2\xa7526, p. 1082 (1925); see E.

It does because no one doubts that the state law \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period[s]\xe2\x80\x9d referenced in the second half of the sentence were at the time of section 1367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment\xe2\x80\x94and still are\xe2\x80\x94grace periods allowing parties a specified number of days or months after dismissal to refile in the proper court.  See,<i> e.g., </i>Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9380\xe2\x80\x93111 (1990) (providing that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cmay commence a new action upon the same cause of action within ninety days after the termination of the original action\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  In fact, these statutes were often self-consciously patterned on the journey\xe2\x80\x99s account doctrine, seeking to address much the same problem the common law faced with much the same solution.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  And the fact that Congress used a variant of the word \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d in the second half of the sentence to refer to grace periods strongly suggests it did so in the first half of the sentence too.  So that the first phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be <i>tolled</i> while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days\xe2\x80\x9d should be understood to extend a grace period of 30 days after dismissal much as the second phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<i>tolling</i> period\xe2\x80\x9d is understood to refer the reader to parallel state law grace periods affording short periods for refiling after dismissal.</p><p>The alternative reading endorsed by the Court today extends too little respect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s competency as drafter.  It asks us to assume the legislature was so garbled in its expression that it switched the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctoll\xe2\x80\x9d halfway through a single sentence without telling anyone.  It asks us to conclude that when Congress spoke of the period \xe2\x80\x9ctolled\xe2\x80\x9d in the first part of the sentence it meant to refer (unambiguously, no less) to a stop clock approach even though it used the term \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to existing state law grace periods in the second part of the sentence.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text drops no hint of such a silent switch and it\xe2\x80\x99s a lexicographical leap our traditional rules of statutory interpretation warn against.</p><p>That, though, represents just the beginning of the textual troubles with the approach the Court adopts.  Con- sider next the fact that section 1367(d) tells us to apply its federal tolling rule \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d state law provides a \xe2\x80\x9clonger tolling period.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this way, the statute asks us to compare the length of the state \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d with the length of the federal \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d set by section 1367(d) and apply the longer one.  See <i>ante,</i> at 16 (courts apply the federal rule if \xe2\x80\x9cthe state-law tolling period will not be longer than \xc2\xa71367(d)\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d).  The equation we\xe2\x80\x99re asked to perform is straightforward and sensible if we understand both the state and federal \xe2\x80\x9ctolling periods\xe2\x80\x9d discussed in this statute as grace periods.  We simply pick the longer grace period: is it the federal 30 day period or one provided by state law?</p><p>By contrast, the equation is anything but straightforward or sensible under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  The Court tells us that, under its reading of the statute, the federal \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cduration of the claim\xe2\x80\x99s pendency in federal court\xe2\x80\x9d plus 30 days.  See <i>ante,</i> at 12, 15.  So the decision whether to apply the federal or the state tolling period turns not on the sensible question which would afford the plaintiff more time to refile but instead on the happenstance of how long the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim sat in federal court before dismissal.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, we apply the federal stop clock rule if, but only if, the time the case happened to linger in federal court before dismissal (plus 30 days) is longer than the relevant state grace period.  But to state the test is to see it is a nonsense\xe2\x80\x94one we would not lightly attribute to any rational drafter, let alone Congress.</p><p>Consider some examples of the absurdities that follow from the apples-to-oranges comparison the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test requires.  Say state law provides a 5 year statute of limitations and a 1 year grace period for refiling.  The plaintiff files in federal court one day before the statute of limitations expires.  The litigation in federal court lasts 1 year.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the federal \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d would be 1 year plus 30 days\xe2\x80\x94the time the claim was pending in federal court plus 30 days after dismissal.  That period is longer than the state tolling period of 1 year and so the federal tolling rule, not the state rule, controls\xe2\x80\x94leaving the plaintiff only 31 days to refile her claim after dismissal even though state law would have allowed a full year.</p><p>That may be curious enough, but curiouser it gets.  Now suppose the litigation in federal court lasts only 10 months.  That makes the federal tolling period only 11 months (10 months plus 30 days).  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, state law now provides a longer tolling period (1 year) and the litigant gets a full year to refile in state court instead of 31 days.  No one has offered a reason why the happenstance of how long the federal litigation lasted should determine how much time a litigant has to refile in state court.  Yet that is what the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of section 1367(d) demands.</p><p>Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to imagine the rule the Court really wants to adopt today: it would like to afford litigants as a matter of federal law the benefit of a stop clock approach whenever doing so would yield more time to refile than the state\xe2\x80\x99s grace period would permit.  But to accomplish so much we would need a very different statute than the one we have.  We would need to be able to compare the relevant state law grace \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d <i>not</i> with the federal \xe2\x80\x9ctolling period\xe2\x80\x9d as the statute says but with the <i>amount of time left under the relevant state limitations period on the date the plaintiff filed her federal suit</i>.  The problem is, no one has even hinted how we might lawfully superimpose all those italicized words (entirely of our own devise) onto the statutory text.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>There are still more textual clues that we have lost our way today.  Congress spoke of the federal tolling period as embracing \xe2\x80\x9c30 days after .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. dismissal.\xe2\x80\x9d  That language sounds like and fits with a traditional grace period or journey\xe2\x80\x99s account approach.  As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, grace periods often speak about affording parties some short period of time after dismissal to refile their claims.  Meanwhile, this language proves no small challenge to square with a stop clock approach.  Generally we say a clock is stopped due to the onset of a particular event like a disability: <i>something</i> usually causes the stopping of the clock and when that <i>something</i> goes away, the clock restarts.  Here, the Court says, the clock stops once a claim is pending in federal court.  Yet it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restart when that something\xe2\x80\x94the claim\xe2\x80\x99s pendency\xe2\x80\x94goes away but instead waits another 30 days before ticking again.  All without any apparent reason for the additional delay.</p><p>This case illustrates the oddity.  The petitioner filed her suit in federal court with 23 months remaining on the three year statute of limitations.  The case remained in federal district court for nearly three years before dismissal.  Under the grace period approach the 30 day provision does just as it appears, providing petitioner with 30 days to journey to and refile in the correct court.  Under the stop clock approach, though, the statute affords the petitioner 23 months <i>plus</i> a random 30 days more to refile.  Indeed, on the stop clock approach the <i>only </i>work the 30 day period is even imaginably left to do comes in cases where the plaintiff filed her federal suit at the very end of the limitations period.  And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the only problem Congress sought to address, it chose a mighty murky way to do it, for the parties point to not a single stop clock provision in all of federal law that includes language anything like this.  All while (again) this language fits hand in glove with every grace period statute known.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>Beyond all these textual clues lie important contextual ones too.  When Congress replants the roots of preexisting law in the federal code, this Court assumes it brings with it the surrounding soil, retaining the substance of the tradition it engages.  Respect for Congress, this Court has held, means assuming it knows and \xe2\x80\x9clegislate[s] against a background of [the] common law .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. principles\xe2\x80\x9d found in the field where it is working.  <i>Samantar</i> v. <i>Yousuf</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305,320, n.13 (2010); see also <i>Goodyear Atomic Corp.</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 174\xe2\x80\x93185 (1988).  And, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, the state law of tolling Congress expressly referenced and replanted in section 1367(d) comes heavily encrusted with meaning.  In cases involving dismissal and refiling, state statutory law and the common law from which it grew have long afforded a grace period to allow the litigant an appropriately tailored time to find his way to the proper court.  Meanwhile, a stop clock approach isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually part of this ecosystem for nothing has dis- abled the litigant from reaching a court in the first place and all he must do is journey from the old court to the new one.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t assume Congress strips replanted statutes of their soil, and we should not assume Congress displaced so much tradition in favor of something comparatively foreign.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reformation of the statute introduces another problem still\xe2\x80\x94one of significantly greater magnitude yet.  In our constitutional structure, the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s powers are supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cfew and defined,\xe2\x80\x9d while the powers reserved to the States \xe2\x80\x9cremain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. numerous and indefinite.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (Madison); <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  No doubt, the Constitution affords Congress the authority to make laws that are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to carry out its defined duties.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18.  But it is difficult to see how, on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, section 1367(d) might be said to survive that test\xe2\x80\x94how it might be said to be necessary and proper to effectuate any recognized federal power or how it could be called anything other than an unconstitutional intrusion on the core state power to define the terms of state law claims liti- gated in state court proceedings.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]</p><p>Under our precedent, the analysis here begins with <i>Jinks</i> v. <i>Richland County</i>,538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 456 (2003).  Without some tolling rule for dismissed state law supplemental claims, the Court in <i>Jinks</i> noted, federal courts would be left with \xe2\x80\x9cthree basic choices:\xe2\x80\x9d (1) \xe2\x80\x9ccondition dismissal of the state-law claim on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cretain jurisdiction over the state-law claim even though it would more appropriately be heard in state court\xe2\x80\x9d; or (3) \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss the state-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the fed-eral case if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 462\xe2\x80\x93463.  All three choices, the Court held, would negatively affect the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98administration of justice\xe2\x80\x99 in <i>federal</i> court\xe2\x80\x9d and thus impair the exercise of the enumerated \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power\xe2\x80\x9d of the federal government in Article III.  <i>Id.,</i> at 462 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court reasoned, <i>some</i> tolling rule \xe2\x80\x9cassur[ing] that state-law claims asserted under [the supplemental jurisdiction statute] will not become time barred while pending in federal court\xe2\x80\x9d is necessary and proper to the execution of the federal judicial power.  <i>Id.,</i> at 464<i>.</i></p><p> The necessary and proper federal interest <i>Jinks</i> recognized is fully discharged by a grace period.  Even petitioner appears to concede this.  See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the grace period approach also guarantees a plaintiff who is unsuccessful in federal court the opportunity to bring a claim in state court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor could anyone easily argue otherwise.  <i>Jinks</i> itself proceeded to uphold the constitutionality of section 1367(d) as necessary and proper on the basis of an understanding<i> </i>that the statute guar- anteed just 30 days to a disappointed litigant to refile in state court.  No one in <i>Jinks</i> even hinted that a longer period might be necessary or proper to serve any valid federal interest.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]</p><p>For good reason, it turns out.  Trying to imagine how the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel twist on section 1367(d) might serve a necessary and proper federal interest is a hard business.  To discharge the federal interest in preventing state law claims from \xe2\x80\x9cbecom[ing] time barred while pending in federal court\xe2\x80\x9d it may be necessary to impose a short grace period.  But how is it necessary to do anything more than that, like consult the happenstance of how long the federal court took to dismiss the case and then tack an equivalent number of months or years onto state law limitations periods?  What federal interest could <i>that</i> even plausibly serve?  The Court does not and cannot attempt an answer because its proffered solution is simply orthogonal to any federal concern.</p><p>To be sure, the Court suggests that its approach will help the States.  See <i>ante</i>, at 19.  But a great many States have suggested the opposite, complaining to us that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach will regularly relegate to the dustbin their own state limitations policy choices.  See Brief for State of Wisconsin et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 22\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6\xe2\x80\x9329.  And surely they would seem better positioned than we to know their own interests.  To this, the Court replies that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ere the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely\xe2\x80\x9d file \xe2\x80\x9ctwo actions [one in federal, the other in state court] and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit,\xe2\x80\x9d causing \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 19.  But, of course, this observation does nothing to tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to serve a <i>federal </i>interest.  Nor does it even tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to help the <i>States</i>.  A very long historical record before us suggests that grace periods have worked well to obviate the need for simultaneous filings in state and federal court; the Court offers no account why its innovation might be needed only now to rescue States from their own legislative choices about the appropriate lifespan of their state law claims.</p><p>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach isn\xe2\x80\x99t just unnecessary; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t proper either.  A law is not \xe2\x80\x9cproper for carrying into [e]xecution\xe2\x80\x9d an enumerated power if it \xe2\x80\x9cviolates the principle of state sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d reflected in our constitutional tradition.  <i>Printz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 898\xe2\x80\x93924 (1997).  The word \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cused during the founding era to describe the powers of a governmental entity as peculiarly within the province or jurisdiction of that en- tity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawson &amp; Granger, The \xe2\x80\x9cProper\xe2\x80\x9d Scope of Federal Power: A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L.\xc2\xa0J. 267, 297 (1993).  Limitations periods for state law claims fall well within the peculiar province of state sovereign authority.  As Chancellor Kent explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he period sufficient to constitute a bar to the litigation of sta[l]e demands, is a question of municipal policy and regulation, and one which belongs to the discretion of every government, consulting its own interest and convenience.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sun Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Wortman</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 717,726 (1988) (quoting 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 462\xe2\x80\x93463 (2d ed. 1832)).  Described as \xe2\x80\x9claws for administering justice,\xe2\x80\x9d time bars are \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hawkins</i> v. <i>Barney\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 5 Pet. 457, 466 (1831).  And \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a remote antiquity,\xe2\x80\x9d they have been the province of the sovereign \xe2\x80\x9cby which it exercises its legislation for all persons and property within its jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey</i> v. <i>Cohen</i>, 13 Pet. 312, 327 (1839).  Our States have long \xe2\x80\x9cexercise[d] this right in virtue of their sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The decision today gives short shrift to these traditional interests.  Just consider how differently the two approaches treat States when it comes to one of their most \xe2\x80\x9cim- portant of sovereign rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under a grace period approach, Congress simply fills a void, for the great bulk of States provide for grace periods of 30 days or longer; only a few States don\xe2\x80\x99t allow that much or don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the question.  See n.\xc2\xa03, <i>supra</i>.  So on the grace period account, Congress provides a modest backstop consistent with existing state law.  By contrast, under the stop clock interpretation, state law grace periods are displaced whenever the federal litigation (plus those odd 30 days) happens to be longer than the state law grace period.  And that, of course, is sure to happen often, for federal litigation is no quick business and state law grace periods often are.  Any time federal litigation (plus, again, 30 days) lasts longer than the 30 or 60 or 90 or 365 day grace period found in state law, state law will be forced to give way, and a federally mandated stop clock approach will usurp its place.</p><p>The stop clock approach, then, ensures that traditional state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims will be routinely displaced\xe2\x80\x94and displaced in favor of nothing more than a fortuity (the time a claim sits in federal court) that bears no rational relationship to any federal interest.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach forces state courts to entertain routinely state law claims that the state legislatures treat as no claims at all.  And it forces state courts to entertain claims that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just stale by days or weeks under state law, but stale by months or even many years too.  So, for example, take a plaintiff who files suit in federal court shortly after a six year state law limitations period begins running and the litigation lasts six years before it\xe2\x80\x99s finally dismissed.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, federal law will now promise the plaintiff nearly six years more (plus those stray 30 days again) to refile his claim in state court.  Neither is this illustration fiction; it is drawn from the facts of <i>Berke</i> v. <i>Buckley Broadcasting Corp.</i>, 821 A. 2d 118, 121 (N. J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003).  See also <i>Krause</i> v. <i>Textron Fin. Corp.</i>, 2007 WL 8054628, *1\xe2\x80\x932 (Fla. Cir. Ct. 2007); Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (offering many more examples).  Given all this, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments complain that the result the Court reaches today flies in the face of federalism.[<a href="#F10">10</a>]</p><p>The Court today clears away a fence that once marked a basic boundary between federal and state power.  Maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the most vital fence and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ve just simply forgotten why this particular fence was built in the first place.  But maybe, too, we\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten because we\xe2\x80\x99ve wandered so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers that we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to lose sight of what it looked like in the first place.  If the federal government can now, without any rational reason, force States to allow state law causes of action in state courts even though the state law limitations period expired many years ago, what exactly can\xe2\x80\x99t it do to override the application of state law to state claims in state court?  What boundaries remain then?</p><p>I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0See Developments in the Law: Statutes of Limitations, 63 Harv.

But it turns out the Court\xe2\x80\x99s stop clock examples often involve situations where some disability prevents the plaintiff from proceeding to court.
