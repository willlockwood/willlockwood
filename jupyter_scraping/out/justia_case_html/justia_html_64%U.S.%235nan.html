The patent from the United States, conveying the fee to the northwest fractional quarter of section two, in township one north, of range twelve west, to the grantee therein named, dated 2 November, 1833, not appearing to be void, is a complete and paramount legal title, and must prevail in this action over the title of the plaintiffs and any equities that may exist between parties behind it can only be assisted and be made available in a court of chancery, but cannot affect the patent in this action, and if the jury believe that the undivided interest mentioned in the declaration is embraced in the patent as a portion of the said tract of land, the finding of the jury should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p>2.

JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>An action of ejectment was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for eastern district of Arkansas, founded on an entry made in a United States land office.  This was the only title produced on the trial by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>The defendant held possession under a patent from the United States to John Pope, Governor &amp;c., with which the defendant connected himself by a regular chain of conveyances.  The circuit court held the patent to be the better legal title, and so instructed the jury, who found for the defendant, and the plaintiffs prosecute this writ of error to reverse that judgment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 64 U. S. 249</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By the statute of Arkansas, an action of ejectment may be maintained where the plaintiff claims possession by virtue of an entry made with the register and receiver of the proper land office of the United States.

The law is only binding on the state courts, and has no force in the circuit courts of the Union.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/62/481/case.html#482">Fenn v.
