Comm\'n, </i>757 F. Supp. 121, 123 (Mass. 1991). The cleanup project was expected to cost $6.1 billion over 10 years. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/935/345/">935 F.2d 345</a>, 347 (CA1 1991). The District Court required construction to proceed without interruption, making no allowance for delays from causes such as labor disputes. App. 71 (Affidavit of Richard D. Fox, Director of the Program Management Division of MWRA). MWRA has primary responsibility for the project. Under its enabling statute and the Commonwealth\'s public-bidding laws, MWRA provides the funds for construction (assisted by state and federal grants), owns the sewage-treatment facilities to be built, establishes all bid conditions, decides all contract awards, pays the contractors, and generally supervises the project. See 935 F. 2d, at 347 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 92 App., \xc2\xa7 1-1 <i>et seq. </i>(1993). Mass. Gen. Laws \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 149:44A to 149:441, and 30:39M (1990)).</p><p>In the spring of 1988, MWRA selected Kaiser Engineers, Inc., as its project manager. Kaiser was to be primarily in charge of managing and supervising construction activity. Kaiser also was to advise MWRA on the development of a labor-relations policy that would maintain worksite harmony, labor-management peace, and overall stability throughout the duration of the project. To that end, Kaiser suggested to MWRA that Kaiser be permitted to negotiate an agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Council and affiliated organizations (BCTC) that would assure labor stability over the life of the project. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-274, p. 75a (MWRA Pet. App.). MWRA accepted Kaiser\'s suggestion, and Kaiser accordingly proceeded to negotiate the Boston Harbor Wastewater Treatment Facilities Project Labor Agreement (Agreement). <i>Ibid. </i>The Agreement included: recognition of BCTC as the exclusive bargaining agent for all craft employees; use of specified methods for resolving all labor-related disputes; a requirement that all employees be subject to union-security provi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="222">222</a></p><p>222 BUILDING &amp; CONSTR.

See generally MWRA Pet. App. 107a (full text of Agreement). MWRA\'s board of directors approved and adopted the Agreement in May 1989 and directed that Bid Specification 13.1 be incorporated into its solicitation of bids for work on the project.1 935 F. 2d, at 347. Bid Specification 13.1 provides in pertinent part:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[E]ach successful bidder and any and all levels of subcontractors, as a condition of being awarded a contract or subcontract, will agree to abide by the provisions of the Boston Harbor Wastewater Treatment Facilities Project Labor Agreement as executed and effective May 22, 1989, by and between Kaiser ... on behalf of [MWRA] and [BCTC] ... and will be bound by the provisions of that agreement in the same manner as any other provision of the contract." MWRA Pet. App. 141a-142a.</p></blockquote><p>In March 1990, a contractors\' association not a party to this litigation filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) contending that the Agreement violated the NLRA. The NLRB General Counsel refused to issue a complaint, finding: (1) that the Agreement is a valid prehire agreement under \xc2\xa7 8(f) of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 158(f), which authorizes such agreements in the construction indus-</p><p>1 Massachusetts competitive-bidding laws require MWRA to state its preference for a contract term, such as a project labor agreement, in the form of a bid specification. These laws, which MWRA\'s Enabling Act explicitly incorporates, see Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 92 App., \xc2\xa7 1-8(g) (1993) (incorporating Mass. Gen. Laws \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 30:39M, and 149:44A to 149:44H), require that the competitive-bidding process be carried out by the awarding authority. See <i>Modern Continental Constr. Co. </i>v. <i>Lowell, </i>391 Mass. 829, 836,465 N.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 158(e). This proviso sets forth an exception from \xc2\xa7 8(e)\'s prohibition against "hot cargo" agreements that require an employer to refrain from doing business with any person not agreeing to be bound by a prehire agreement. <i>Building </i>&amp; <i>Trades Council (Kaiser Engineers, </i>Inc.), Case 1-CE-71, NLRB Advice Memo, June 25, 1990, MWRA Pet. App. 88a.</p><p>Also in March 1990, respondent Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. (ABC), an organization representing nonunion construction-industry employers, brought this suit against MWRA, Kaiser, and BCTC, seeking, among other things, to enjoin enforcement of Bid Specification 13.1. ABC alleged pre-emption under the NLRA, pre-emption under \xc2\xa7 514(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 897, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1144(c) (ERISA), violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, conspiracy to reduce competition in violation of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1, and various state-law claims. Only NLRA pre-emption is at issue here.</p><p>The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts rejected each of ABC\'s claims and denied its motion for a preliminary injunction. MWRA Pet. App. 76a-83a. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and directed entry of a preliminary injunction restraining the use of Bid Specification 13.1, reaching only the issue of NLRA pre-emption. 135 LRRM 2713 (1990). The Court of Appeals subsequently granted a petition for rehearing en bane, vacating the panel opinion. MWRA Pet. App. 84a. Upon rehearing en bane, the Court of Appeals, by a 3-to-2 vote, again reversed the judgment of the District Court, once more reaching only the pre-emption issue. 935 F. 2d, at 359-360.

See <i>Cipollone </i>v. <i>Liggett Group, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/case.html">505 U.

S. 725</a>, 746 (1981). With these general principles in mind, we turn to the particular pre-emption doctrines that have developed around the NLRA.</p><p>In <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Massachusetts, </i>471 U. S., at 748, we noted: "The Court has articulated two distinct NLRA pre-emption principles." The first, <i>"Garmon </i>preemption," see <i>San Diego Building Trades Council </i>v. <i>Garmon, supra, </i>forbids state and local regulation of activities that are "protected by \xc2\xa7 7 of the [NLRA], or constitute an unfair labor practice under \xc2\xa7 8." 359 U. S., at 244. See also <i>Garner </i>v. <i>Teamsters, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html">346 U. S. 485</a>, 498-499 (1953) ("[W]hen</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="225">225</a></p><p>two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same activity, a conflict is imminent"). <i>Garmon </i>pre-emption prohibits regulation even of activities that the NLRA only <i>arguably </i>protects or prohibits. See <i>Wisconsin Dept. of Industry </i>v. <i>Gould Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/282/case.html">475 U. S. 282</a>, 286 (1986). This rule of pre-emption is designed to prevent conflict between, on the one hand, state and local regulation and, on the other, Congress\' "integrated scheme of regulation," <i>Garmon, 359 </i>U. S., at 247, embodied in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7 and 8 of the NLRA, which includes the choice of the NLRB, rather than state or federal courts, as the appropriate body to implement the Act. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Massachusetts, </i>471 U. S., at 748-749, and n. 26.</p><p>In <i>Garmon, </i>this Court held that a state court was precluded from awarding damages to employers for economic injuries resulting from peaceful picketing by labor unions that had not been selected by a majority of employees as their bargaining agent. 359 U. S., at 246. The Court said:</p><p>"Our concern is with delimiting areas of conduct which must be free from state regulation if national policy is to be left unhampered." <i>Ibid. </i>In <i>Gould, </i>we held that the NLRA pre-empts a statute that disqualifies from doing business with the State persons who have violated the NLRA three times within a 5-year period. We emphasized there that "the <i>Garmon </i>rule prevents States not only from setting forth standards of conduct inconsistent with the substantive requirements of the NLRA, but also from providing their own regulatory or judicial remedies for conduct prohibited or arguably prohibited by the Act." 475 U. S., at 286 (citing 359 U. S., at 247).</p><p>A second pre-emption principle, <i>"Machinists </i>preemption," see <i>Machinists </i>v. <i>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n, </i>427 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for compensatory damages against the city. In so holding, we stated that the <i>Machinists </i>rule created a zone free from all regulations, whether state or federal. 493 U.

When a State owns and manages property, for example, it must interact with private participants in the marketplace. In so doing, the State is not subject to pre-emption by the NLRA, because pre-emption doctrines apply only to state <i>regulation.</i></p><p>Our decisions in this area support the distinction between government as regulator and government as proprietor. We have held consistently that the NLRA was intended to supplant state labor <i>regulation, </i>not all legitimate state activity that affects labor. In <i>Machinists, </i>for example, we referred to Congress\' pre-emptive intent to "leave some activities <i>unregulated," </i>427 U. S., at 144 (emphasis added), and held that the activities at issue-workers deciding together to refuse overtime work-were not <i>"regulable </i>by States," <i>id., </i>at 149 (emphasis added). In <i>Golden State I, </i>we held that the reason Los Angeles could not condition renewal of a taxicab franchise upon settlement of a labor dispute was that <i>"Machinists </i>pre-emption ... precludes state and municipal <i>regulation </i>\'concerning conduct that Congress intended to be <i>unregulated.\'" </i>475 U. S., at 614 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Massachusetts, </i>471 U. S., at 749). We refused to permit the city\'s exercise of its regulatory power of license nonrenewal to restrict Golden State\'s right to use lawful economic weapons in its dispute with its union. See 475 U. S., at 615-619. As petitioners point out, a very different case would have been presented had the city of Los Angeles purchased taxi services from Golden State in order to transport city employees. Brief for Petitioners 35. In that situation, if the strike had produced serious interruptions in the services the city had purchased, the city would not necessarily have been pre-empted from advising Golden State that it would hire another company if</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="228">228</a></p><p>228 BUILDING &amp; CONSTR.

We noted in doing so that <i>in that case, </i>"debarment ... serves plainly as a means of enforcing the NLRA." 475 U. S., at 287. We said there that "[t]he State concedes, as we think it must, that the point of the statute is to deter labor law violations"; we concluded that "[n]o other purpose could credibly be ascribed." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Respondents quote the following passage from <i>Gould, </i>arguing that it stands for the proposition that the State as proprietor is subject to the same pre-emption limitations as the State as regulator:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Nothing in the NLRA, of course, prevents private purchasers from boycotting labor law violators. But government occupies a unique position of power in our society, and its conduct, regardless of form, is rightly subject to special restraints. Outside the area of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is far from unusual for federal law to prohibit States from making spending decisions in ways that are permissible for private parties .... The NLRA, moreover, has long been understood to protect a range of conduct against state but not private interference .... The Act treats state action differently from private action not merely because they frequently take different forms, but also because in our system States simply are different from private parties and have a different role to play." <i>Id., </i>at 290.</p></blockquote><p>The above passage does not bear the weight that respondents would have it support. The conduct at issue in <i>Gould </i>was a state agency\'s attempt to compel conformity with the NLRA. Because the statute at issue in <i>Gould </i>addressed</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="229">229</a></p><p>employer conduct unrelated to the employer\'s performance of contractual obligations to the State, and because the State\'s reason for such conduct was to deter NLRA violations, we concluded: "Wisconsin \'simply is not functioning as a private purchaser of services,\' ... [and therefore,] for all practical purposes, Wisconsin\'s debarment scheme is tantamount to regulation." <i>Id., </i>at 289. We emphasized that we were "not say[ing] that state purchasing decisions may never be influenced by labor considerations." <i>Id., </i>at 291.</p><p>The conceptual distinction between regulator and purchaser exists to a limited extent in the private sphere as well. A private actor, for example, can participate in a boycott of a supplier on the basis of a labor policy concern rather than a profit motive. See id., at 290. The private actor under such circumstances would be attempting to "regulate" the suppliers and would not be acting as a typical proprietor. The fact that a private actor may "regulate" does not mean, of course, that the private actor may be "pre-empted" by the NLRA; the Supremacy Clause does not require pre-emption of private conduct. Private actors therefore may "regulate" as they please, as long as their conduct does not violate the law. As the above passage in <i>Gould </i>makes clear, however, States have a qualitatively different role to play from private parties. <i>Ibid. </i>When the State acts as regulator, it performs a role that is characteristically a governmental rather than a private role, boycotts notwithstanding. Moreover, as regulator of private conduct, the State is more powerful than private parties. These distinctions are far less significant when the State acts as a market participant with no interest in setting policy.</p><p>In <i>Gould, </i>we did not address fully the implications of these distinctions. We left open the question whether a State may act without offending the pre-emption principles of the NLRA when it acts as a proprietor and its acts therefore are not "tantamount to regulation" or policymaking.

In 1959, Congress amended the NLRA to add \xc2\xa78(f) and modify \xc2\xa78(e). Section 8(f) explicitly permits employers in the construction industry-but no other employers-to enter into prehire agreements. Prehire agreements are collective-bargaining agreements providing for union recognition, compulsory union dues or equivalents, and mandatory use of union hiring halls, prior to the hiring of any employees. 935 F. 2d, at 356; Jim <i>McNeff, Inc. </i>v. <i>Todd, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/260/case.html">461 U. S. 260</a>, 265-266 (1983). The 1959 amendment adding a proviso to subsection (e) permits a general contractor\'s prehire agreement to require an employer not to hire other contractors performing work on that particular project site unless they agree to become bound by the terms of that labor agreement. See <i>Woelke </i>&amp; <i>Romero Framing, Inc. </i>v. <i>NLRB, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/645/case.html">456 U. S. 645</a>, 657 (1982). Section 8(f) contains a final proviso that permits employees, once hired, to utilize the NLRB election process under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9(c) and (e) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 159(c) and (e), if they wish to reject the bargaining representative or to cancel the union security provisions of the prehire agreement. See <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>Iron Workers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/335/case.html">434 U. S. 335</a>, 345 (1978).</p><p>It is undisputed that the Agreement between Kaiser and BCTC is a valid labor contract under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(e) and (f). As noted above, those sections explicitly authorize this type of contract between a union and an employer like Kaiser, which is engaged primarily in the construction industry, covering employees engaged in that industry.</p><p>Of course, the exceptions provided for the construction industry in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78(e) and (f), like the prohibitions from which</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="231">231</a></p><p>they provide relief, are not made specifically applicable to the State. This is because the State is excluded from the definition of the term "employer" under the NLRA, see 29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 152(2), and because the State, in any event, is acting not as an employer but as a purchaser in this case. Nevertheless, the general goals behind passage of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(e) and (f) are still relevant to determining what Congress intended with respect to the State and its relationship to the agreements authorized by these sections.</p><p>It is evident from the face of the statute that in enacting exemptions authorizing certain kinds of project labor agreements in the construction industry, Congress intended to accommodate conditions specific to that industry. Such conditions include, among others, the short-term nature of employment which makes posthire collective bargaining difficult, the contractor\'s need for predictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor, and a longstanding custom of prehire bargaining in the industry. See S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 28, 55-56 (1959); H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 19-20 (1959).</p><p>There is no reason to expect these defining features of the construction industry to depend upon the public or private nature of the entity purchasing contracting services. To the extent that a private purchaser may choose a contractor based upon that contractor\'s willingness to enter into a prehire agreement, a public entity <i>as purchaser </i>should be permitted to do the same. Confronted with such a purchaser, those contractors who do not normally enter such agreements are faced with a choice. They may alter their usual mode of operation to secure the business opportunity at hand, or seek business from purchasers whose perceived needs do not include a project labor agreement. In the absence of any express or implied indication by Congress that a State may not manage its own property when it pursues its purely proprietary interests, and where analogous private conduct would be permitted, this Court will not infer such a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="232">232</a></p><p>232 BUILDING &amp; CONSTR.

S., at 746 ("Consideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law").2 Indeed, there is some force to petitioners\' argument, Brief for Petitioners 25, that denying an option to public owner-developers that is available to private ownerdevelopers itself places a restriction on Congress\' intended free play of economic forces identified in <i>Machinists.</i></p><p align="center">\nv</p><p>In the instant case, MWRA acted on the advice of a manager hired to organize performance of a cleanup job over which, under Massachusetts law, MWRA is the proprietor. There is no question but that MWRA was attempting to ensure an efficient project that would be completed as quickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost. As petitioners note, moreover, Brief for Petitioners 26, the challenged action in this litigation was specifically tailored to one particular job, the Boston Harbor cleanup project. There is therefore no basis on which to distinguish the incentives at work here from those that operate elsewhere in the construction industry, incentives that this Court has recognized as legitimate.
