A state habeas court subsequently determined that, under <i>Atkins</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304\n, and <i>Hall</i> v. <i>Florida</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, Moore qualified as intellectually disabled and that his death sentence therefore violated the\n \nEighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s proscription of \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court consulted current medical diagnostic standards\xe2\x80\x94the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities clinical manual (AAIDD\xe2\x80\x9311) and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.  The habeas court followed the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits, (2) adaptive deficits, and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ scores, the court determined, established subaverage intellectual functioning.  The court credited six scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability.  And relying on testimony from mental-health professionals, the court found significant adaptive deficits in all three skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).  Based on its findings, the habeas court recommended to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that Moore be granted relief.  The CCA declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the habeas court.  The CCA held instead that the habeas court erred by not following the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 decision in <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Briseno</i>, 135 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 1, which adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation manual (AAMR\xe2\x80\x939), predecessor to the current AAIDD\xe2\x80\x9311 manual.  <i>Briseno</i> also incorporated the AAMR\xe2\x80\x939\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that adaptive deficits must be \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d to intellectual-functioning deficits, and it recited, without citation to any medical or judicial authority, seven evidentiary factors relevant to the intellectual-disability inquiry.  Based on only two of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ scores (of 74 and 78), the CCA concluded that Moore had not shown significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.  And even if he had, the CCA continued, his adaptive strengths undercut any adaptive weaknesses.  The habeas court also failed, the CCA determined, to inquire into relatedness.  Among alternative causes for Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.  <i>Briseno</i>\xe2\x80\x99s seven evidentiary factors, the CCA further determined, weighed against finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0By rejecting the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s application of medical guidance and by following the <i>Briseno</i> standard, including the nonclinical <i>Briseno</i> factors, the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not comport with the\n \nEighth Amendment and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.

The medical community, however, counts traumatic experiences as <i>risk factors</i> for intellectual disability.  The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to \xe2\x80\x9ca personality disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mental-health professionals recognize that intellectually disabled people may have other co-existing mental or physical impairments, including, <i>e.g., </i>attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism.

The court received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore\xe2\x80\x99s family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.  The evidence revealed that Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.  At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition.  <i>Id.</i>, at 187a.

Regarding the score of 74, the court observed that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s history of academic failure, and the fact that he took the test while \xe2\x80\x9cexhibit[ing] withdrawn and depressive behavior\xe2\x80\x9d on death row, might have hindered his performance.  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 519.  Based on the two scores, but not on the lower portion of their ranges, the court concluded that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s scores ranked \xe2\x80\x9cabove the intellectually disabled range\xe2\x80\x9d (<i>i.e.</i>, above 70).  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>id.</i>, at 513.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cEven if [Moore] had proven that he suffers from significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning,\xe2\x80\x9d the court continued, he failed to prove \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and related limitations in adaptive functioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 520.

But the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert ultimately discounted those test results because Moore had \xe2\x80\x9cno exposure\xe2\x80\x9d to certain tasks the testing included, \xe2\x80\x9csuch as writing a check and using a microwave oven.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 521\xe2\x80\x93522.

Among alterna-tive causes for Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a his-tory of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Moore\xe2\x80\x99s significant improvement in prison, in the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s view, confirmed that his academic and social difficulties were not related to intellectual-functioning deficits.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The court then examined each of the seven <i>Briseno</i> evidentiary factors, see <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, and n.\xc2\xa06, concluding that those factors \xe2\x80\x9cweigh[ed] heavily\xe2\x80\x9d against finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement.  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 526\xe2\x80\x93527.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Alcala dissented.  <i>Atkins </i>and <i>Hall</i>, she would have held, require courts to consult current medical standards to determine intellectual disability.  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 530.

It reached that conclusion based on its findings that he had failed to establish either significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or related significant deficits in adaptive behavior.  The latter conclusion was based, in part, on the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of a set of seven \xe2\x80\x9cevidentiary factors\xe2\x80\x9d from <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Briseno</i>, 135 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 1, 8 (Tex.

I agree with the Court today that those factors are an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of <i>Atkins</i>, and that the CCA therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.  But I do not agree that the CCA erred as to Moore\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual functioning.  Because the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s determination on that ground is an independent basis for its judgment, I would affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">My broader concern with today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, is that it abandons the usual mode of analysis this Court has employed in\n \nEighth Amendment cases.  The Court overturns the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Moore failed to present sufficient evidence of both inadequate intellectual functioning and significant deficits in adaptive behavior without even considering \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards\xe2\x80\x9d reflected in the practices among the States.  <i>Hall</i> v. <i>Florida</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12) (quoting <i>Roper</i> v. <i>Simmons</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551,\n563 (2005)\n).  The Court instead crafts a constitutional holding based solely on what it deems to be medical consensus about intellectual disability.  But clinicians, not judges, should determine clinical standards; and judges, not clinicians, should determine the content of the\n \nEighth Amendment.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion confuses those roles, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On April 25, 1980, Moore and two others were throwing dice when they decided to commit a robbery to obtain money for car payments.  Moore provided the group with two firearms, and the three men began to drive around Houston looking for a target.  Eventually they settled on the Birdsall Super Market.  After negotiating their respective shares of the money they intended to steal and donning disguises, the three went inside, heading straight to a courtesy booth staffed by James McCarble and Edna Scott.  When Scott realized a robbery was occurring and screamed, Moore shot McCarble in the head, killing the 70-year-old instantly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moore fled Houston and remained on the run until his arrest in Louisiana ten days after the murder.  After giving a written statement admitting his participation in the robbery and killing, Moore was charged with capital murder.  A jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Over the next three decades, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s case traversed the state and federal court systems, finally reaching the <i>Atkins</i> hearing at issue today in 2014.  The state habeas court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing, during which it heard testimony from family members, a fellow inmate, a prison official, and four mental health professionals.  The court concluded that Moore had shown intellectual disability and recommended that he be granted relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But it was just that: a recommendation.  Under Texas law, the CCA, not the habeas court, is the ultimate factfinder in habeas corpus proceedings.  <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Reed</i>, 271 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 698, 727 (Tex. Crim.

Assuming that role, the CCA declined to adopt the habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s findings and conclusions, instead conducting its own review of the record to determine whether Moore had shown he was intellectually disabled.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The CCA began by considering the appropriate legal standard for assessing intellectual disability.  Following our instruction to the States to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop[\xc2\xa0] appropriate ways to enforce\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Atkins</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted), the CCA had set out a legal definition for intellectual disability in its prior decision in <i>Ex parte Briseno</i>.  Rather than follow that test, the habeas court below crafted its own standards for intellectual disability.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he decision to modify the legal standard for intellectual disability in the capital-sentencing context,\xe2\x80\x9d the CCA explained, \xe2\x80\x9crests with this Court unless and until the Legislature acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 487.  Just as we have corrected lower courts for taking it upon themselves to dismiss our precedent as outdated, see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Bosse</i> v. <i>Okla-homa</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at2), so too the CCA rebuked the habeas court for ignoring binding CCA precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The CCA went on to explain why there was no reason to modify the legal standard it had previously set out.  <i>Briseno</i> had stated a rule that in order for an <i>Atkins </i>claimant to demonstrate intellectual disability he must show (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and (2) related limitations in adaptive functioning, (3) which had appeared prior to age 18.  See 470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 486.  It also laid out a set of seven evidentiary factors\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Briseno</i> factors\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94designed to assist \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinders .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in weighing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of intellectual disability.  <i>Briseno</i>, 135 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 8.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The three-prong definition of intellectual disability came directly from the ninth edition of the manual published by what is now the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD).  <i>Id.,</i> at 7; see American Association on Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).  By the time Moore\xe2\x80\x99s case reached the CCA, the AAIDD no longer included the requirement that adaptive deficits be \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d to intellectual functioning.  But, as the CCA noted, the most recent version of the other leading diagnostic manual, the DSM\xe2\x80\x935, <i>did</i> include that requirement.  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 487, n.\xc2\xa05; American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 38 (5th ed. 2013) (hereinafter DSM\xe2\x80\x935).  So the CCA was faced with a choice in <i>Moore</i>: Keeping the relatedness requirement would be inconsistent with the AAIDD\xe2\x80\x99s current guidance; dropping it would be out of step with the newest version of the DSM.  The CCA concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal test we established in <i>Briseno</i> remains adequately \xe2\x80\x98informed by the medical community\xe2\x80\x99s diagnostic framework,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and went on to evaluate the case under that approach.  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 487 (quoting <i>Hall</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Starting with intellectual functioning, the CCA conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of tests Moore had taken over the past 40 years.  The CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreli-able: two of them were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two were group-administered tests, which Moore\xe2\x80\x99s own experts had criticized, App. 12 (Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test \xe2\x80\x9cnot accepted as an instrument appropriate for the assessment of mental retardation or intellectual deficiency\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116 (Slosson is \xe2\x80\x9cnot the greatest test\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot the most reliable approach\xe2\x80\x9d); and the administrator of the fifth test concluded it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a valid score\xe2\x80\x9d because of evidence of suboptimal effort, <i>id</i>., at 203.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That left two scores for the CCA to analyze: a 78 and a 74.  Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally shown by an [IQ] of 70 or less.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 486.  \xe2\x80\x9cTaking into account the standard error of measurement\xe2\x80\x9d for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.  <i>Id.,</i> at 519.  As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.  The lower end of that range placed Moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.  The CCA found, however, that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s score was unlikely to be in the lower end of the error-generated range because he was likely exerting poor effort and experiencing depression at the time the test was administered\xe2\x80\x94both factors that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s experts agreed could artificially deflate IQ scores.  <i>Id.,</i> at 516\xe2\x80\x93517, 519; App. 46, 92.  The CCA accordingly concluded that Moore had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Having failed one part of the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s three-part test, Moore could not be found intellectually disabled.  The CCA nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive deficits.  Moore had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which he scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.<b> </b>But Dr. Kristi Compton, the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s abilities.  She reached this conclusion not because of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive strengths but instead because \xe2\x80\x9cshe had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which [Moore] had no exposure, such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d,<i> </i>at 522.  Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore and review of documentary evidence\xe2\x80\x94including school, trial, and prison records\xe2\x80\x94did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.

The Court rejects the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Moore failed to make the requisite showings with respect to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, without any consideration of the state practices that were, three Terms ago, \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d to the\n \nEighth Amendment question.  <i>Hall</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).

Recognizing that we have, in the very recent past, held that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the views of medical experts\xe2\x80\x99 do not \xe2\x80\x98dictate\xe2\x80\x99 a court\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual-disability determination,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court assures us that it is not requiring adherence \xe2\x80\x9cto everything stated in the latest medical guide,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (quoting <i>Hall</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19)); States have \xe2\x80\x9csome flexibility\xe2\x80\x9d but cannot \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d medical standards.  <i>Ante, </i>at 10, 17.  Neither the Court\xe2\x80\x99s articulation of this standard nor its application sheds any light on what it means.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s stated principle.  \xe2\x80\x9cDisregard\xe2\x80\x9d normally means to dismiss as unworthy of attention, and that is plainly not what the CCA did here.  For example, the Court faults the CCA for placing too much weight on Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive strengths and functioning in prison, implying that this marked a dismissal of clinical standards.  Yet the CCA was aware of and, in a prior decision, had addressed the fact that some clinicians would counsel against considering such information.  See 470 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 489 (citing <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Cathey</i>, 451 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 1, 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (2014)).

As to prison conduct, the CCA decided that the fundamental questions the <i>Atkins</i> inquiry sought to answer were best considered\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9csound scientific principles\xe2\x80\x9d best served\xe2\x80\x94by taking account of \xe2\x80\x9c<i>all</i> possible data that sheds light on a person\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning, including his conduct in a prison society.\xe2\x80\x9d  451 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The CCA considered clinical standards and explained why it decided that departure from those standards was warranted.  The court did not \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d medical standards.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do the Court\xe2\x80\x99s identified errors clarify the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d we are told States retain in this area.  The Court faults the CCA for \xe2\x80\x9coveremphasiz[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d strengths and \xe2\x80\x9cstress[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d Moore\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in prison, <i>ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, suggesting that some\xe2\x80\x94but not <i>too much</i>\xe2\x80\x94consideration of strengths and prison functioning is acceptable.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only guidance on when \xe2\x80\x9csome\xe2\x80\x9d becomes \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d?  Citations to clinical guides.

The line between the permissible\xe2\x80\x94consideration, maybe even emphasis\xe2\x80\x94and the forbidden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coveremphasis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is not only thin, but totally undefined by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.

Consider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cthe medical community[\xe2\x80\x99s] focus[\xc2\xa0] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on adaptive <i>deficits</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe CCA overemphasized Moore\xe2\x80\x99s perceived adaptive strengths.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 12.  In support of this proposition, the Court cites the AAIDD\xe2\x80\x99s direction that \xe2\x80\x9csignificant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 47 (11th ed. 2010) (hereinafter AAIDD\xe2\x80\x9311).  Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways it might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas\xe2\x80\x94conceptual, social, and practical\xe2\x80\x94should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform a skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.  And it appears that clinicians do, in fact, disagree about what this direction means.  Compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Brief for AAIDD et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe clinician\xe2\x80\x99s diagnostic focus does not\xe2\x80\x94and cannot\xe2\x80\x94involve <i>any form</i> of \xe2\x80\x98balancing\xe2\x80\x99 deficits against the abilities or strengths which the particular individual may also possess\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)) with Hagan, Drogin, &amp; Guilmette, Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases after <i>Hall</i> and DSM\xe2\x80\x935, 44 J.

The two primary clinical guides do offer caution about considering functioning in prison.  But the stringency of their caution differs, with the AAIDD seeming to enact a flat ban on ever looking to functioning in prison and the DSM urging \xe2\x80\x9cif possible\xe2\x80\x9d to consider \xe2\x80\x9ccorroborative information reflecting functioning outside\xe2\x80\x9d of prison.  AAIDD, User\xe2\x80\x99s Guide: Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 20 (11th ed. 2012); DSM\xe2\x80\x935, at 38.  The CCA followed the DSM\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x99s instruction, relying on Dr. Compton\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9ceven before [Moore] went to prison\xe2\x80\x9d he demonstrated a \xe2\x80\x9clevel of adaptive functioning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. too great .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to support an intellectual-disability diagnosis.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 S. W. 3d, at 526.  In deter-mining that the CCA erred in this regard, the Court implicitly rejects the DSM\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the proper consideration of prison conduct and accepts what it takes to be that of the AAIDD.  The Court does not attempt to explain its justification for why the\n \nEighth Amendment should favor one side over the other in this clinical debate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cPsychiatry is not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an exact science.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ake</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 68,\n81 (1985)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[B]ecause there often is no single, accurate psychiatric conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d we have emphasized the importance of allowing the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary factfinder[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cresolve differences in opinion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the basis of the evidence offered by each party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  You would not know it from reading the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today, but that is precisely what the CCA\xe2\x80\x94the factfinder under Texas law\xe2\x80\x94did in the decision below: Confronted with dueling expert opinions about how to evaluate adaptive functioning and what conclusion to reach, the CCA resolved the dispute before it by accepting the testimony of the expert it deemed most credible. <i> </i>Of course, reliance on an expert opinion does not insulate a decision from further judicial review.  But, unlike the Court, I am unwilling to upset the considered judgment of the forensic psychologist that the factfinding court deemed the most credible based on my own interpretation of a few sentences excised from medical texts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As for how I would resolve this case, there is one aspect of the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s approach to intellectual disability that is incompatible with the\n \nEighth Amendment: the <i>Briseno</i> factors.  As the Court explains, no state legislature has approved the use of these or any similar factors.  Although the CCA reviewed these factors to determine whether Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive deficits were \xe2\x80\x9crelated\xe2\x80\x9d to his intellectual functioning, it may be that consideration of those factors tainted the whole of the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning analysis.  I need not decide this question, however, because the CCA reached the issue of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning only after concluding that he had failed to demonstrate intellectual functioning sufficiently low to warrant a finding of intellectual disability, regardless of his adaptive deficits or their relation to his IQ.  Moore has not presented sufficient reason to upset that independent holding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court concludes that the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ scores is \xe2\x80\x9cirreconcilable with <i>Hall</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 10.  Not so.  <i>Hall</i> rejected a Florida rule that required a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to demonstrate intellectual disability, thereby barring consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) of an over-70 score.  But the CCA did not apply Florida\xe2\x80\x99s rule\xe2\x80\x94or anything like it.  The court in fact began by taking account of the SEM, explaining that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s tested score of 74 led to an IQ range between 69 and 79.  The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.  Based on that evidence, the CCA discounted portions of the SEM-generated range and concluded that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ did not lie in the relevant range for intellectual disability.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Hall</i> provided no definitive guidance on this sort of approach: recognizing the inherent imprecision of IQ tests, but considering additional evidence to determine whether an SEM-generated range of scores accurately reflected a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s actual IQ.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Indeed, in its catalog of States that \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] taken a position contrary to that of Florida,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court in <i>Hall</i> included a State that granted trial courts discretion to draw \xe2\x80\x9creasonable inferences\xe2\x80\x9d about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the SEM.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 15, 16) (quoting <i>Pizzuto</i> v. <i>State</i>, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P.\xc2\xa03d 642, 651 (2008)).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  That is the approach the CCA took here.  If that approach was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary\xe2\x80\x9d to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s rule in <i>Hall</i>, I do not understand how <i>Hall</i> can be read to reject that approach today.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on intellectual functioning turns solely on the fact that Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ range was 69 to 79 rather than 70 to 80.  See <i>ante, </i>at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the lower end of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore\xe2\x80\x99s adaptive functioning\xe2\x80\x9d).  The CCA certainly did not \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d SEM in assessing Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ, and it explained why other factors led it to conclude that his actual score did not fall near the lower end of the SEM range.  Only by insisting on the absolute conformity to medical standards the Court disclaims can it find a violation of the\n \nEighth Amendment based on that one-point difference.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  <i>Ibid.</i>  In concluding that the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score, the Court today is just as wrong as the Florida Supreme Court was in <i>Hall</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not compelled by <i>Hall</i>; it is an expansion of it.  Perhaps there are reasons to expand <i>Hall</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding\xe2\x80\x94to say that States must read IQ tests as rigidly encompassing the entire SEM range, regardless of any other evidentiary considerations, or to say that the reasons that the CCA gave for discounting the lower end of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s IQ range were improper.  But before holding that the Constitution demands either result, our precedent requires consulting state judgments on the matter to determine whether a national consensus has developed.  Moore has presented no argument as to such a consensus, and the majority does not claim that there is one.
