None of the other defendants answered the bill.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE LIVINGSTON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from a decree in equity of the Circuit Court for the District of Virginia, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 18 U. S. 315</a></p><p> to which the following objections have been made:</p>\n<p>1st.  That there is a defect of parties.  Although all the persons in interest are made defendants to the bill, yet none of them had appeared to it except the appellant, on whose answer and the proofs in the cause the decree was made.</p>\n<p>2d.  Another objection is that there was competent relief at law against the usurious contract stated in the bill; but as no defense of this kind was there set up, a court of chancery ought not to have interfered, especially after judgment had been obtained on the bills, and even on the prison bounds bonds, which were taken on the execution which had issued on those judgments.</p>\n<p>3d.  It is also contended that there was no usury in any of the contracts between the appellant and Carter Beverley, and that the sale of the negroes under the deed of trust was fair and in strict pursuance of the authority vested in the trustee.</p>\n<p>4th and lastly.  Admitting the usury and a fraud in the sale, it is insisted that the respondent, being an entire stranger to these transactions, had no right to call the appellant to account or to any relief as against him.</p>\n<p>The Court has had under its consideration all these objections, but will now give its opinion only on the first of them.  We are all satisfied that when this decree was pronounced, the case was not prepared for a final hearing.  The bills, which had been drawn by P. R. Beverley, having passed by Marshall into the hands of third persons, who had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 18 U. S. 316</a></p><p> obtained judgments on them, and it being a principal object of the suit to enjoin further proceedings on them, the parties in whose favor they were rendered ought not only to have been made defendants, but a perpetual injunction ought not to have been decreed until their answers were filed.  It was not enough in their absence that the complainant should state and the defendant admit that the latter had paid these judgments and was now the only person interested in them.  This might be done by collusion, and although that may not be the case here, it is not the course of a court of equity to make a decree which is to operate directly upon the parties in interest, as the perpetual injunction does here, without affording them an opportunity of being heard.  For this error, the decree must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><em>Decree reversed.</em></p>\n<p>DECREE.  This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court for the District of Virginia and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that the said circuit court erred in perpetually enjoining the proceedings on the judgments obtained against the respondent, Peter R. Beverley, and the appellant, Horace Marshall, because the bills of exchange, which had been drawn by the said Peter R. Beverley had passed into the hands of third persons by whom the said judgments had been obtained, and before the answers of such creditors, who had been made defendants to said bill of complaint, had come </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 18 U. S. 317</a></p><p> in.  It is therefore DECREED and ORDERED that the decree of the said circuit court in this case be and the same is hereby reversed and annulled.  And it is further ordered that the said cause be remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings to be had therein according to law.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
