JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We consider on this appeal whether a State may punish a member of its Bar who, seeking to further political and ideological goals through associational activity, including litigation, advises a lay person of her legal rights and discloses in a subsequent letter that free legal assistance is available from a nonprofit organization with which the lawyer and her associates are affiliated.  Appellant, a member of the Bar of South Carolina, received a public reprimand for writing such a letter.  The appeal is opposed by the State Attorney General, on behalf of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.  As this appeal presents a substantial question under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as interpreted in <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span> (1963), we noted probable jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellant, Edna Smith Primus, is a lawyer practicing in Columbia, S.C.  During the period in question, she was associated with the "Carolina Community Law Firm," [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and was an officer of and cooperating lawyer with the Columbia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  She received </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 436 U. S. 415</a></p><p> no compensation for her work on behalf of the ACLU, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] but was paid a retainer as a legal consultant for the South Carolina Council on Human Relations (Council), a nonprofit organization with offices in Columbia.</p>\n<p>During the summer of 1973, local and national newspapers reported that pregnant mothers on public assistance in Aiken County, S.C. were being sterilized or threatened with sterilization as a condition of the continued receipt of medical assistance under the Medicaid program. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Concerned by this development, Gary Allen, an Aiken businessman and officer of a local organization serving indigents, called the Council requesting that one of its representatives come to Aiken to address some of the women who had been sterilized.  At the Council\'s behest, appellant, who had not known Allen previously, called him and arranged a meeting in his office in July, 1973.  Among those attending was Mary Etta Williams, who had been sterilized by Dr. Clovis H. Pierce after the birth of her third child.  Williams and her grandmother attended the meeting because Allen, an old family friend, had invited </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 436 U. S. 416</a></p><p> them and because Williams wanted "[t]o see what it was all about. . . ."  App. 412.  At the meeting, appellant advised those present, including Williams and the other women who had been sterilized by Dr. Pierce, of their legal rights and suggested the possibility of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Early in August, 1973, the ACLU informed appellant that it was willing to provide representation for Aiken mothers who had been sterilized. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Appellant testified that, after being advised by Allen that Williams wished to institute suit against Dr. Pierce, she decided to inform Williams of the ACLU\'s offer of free legal representation.  Shortly after receiving appellant\'s letter, dated August 30, 1973 [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] -- the centerpiece of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 436 U. S. 417</a></p><p> litigation -- Wllliams visited Dr. Pierce to discuss the progress of her third child, who was ill.  At the doctor\'s office, she encountered his lawyer, and, at the latter\'s request, signed a release of liability in the doctor\'s favor.  Williams showed appellant\'s letter to the doctor and his lawyer, and they retained a copy.  She then called appellant from the doctor\'s office and announced her intention not to sue.  There was no further communication between appellant and Williams.</p>\n<p>On October 9, 1974, the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of South Carolina (Board) filed a formal complaint with the Board, charging that appellant had engaged in "solicitation in violation of the Canons of Ethics" by sending the August 30, 1973, letter to Williams.  App. 1-2.  Appellant denied any unethical solicitation and asserted, <em>inter alia,</em> that her conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and by Canon 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association (ABA).  The complaint was heard by a panel of the Board on March 20, 1975.  The State\'s evidence consisted of the letter, the testimony of Williams, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 436 U. S. 418</a></p><p> and a copy of the summons and complaint in the action instituted against Dr. Pierce and various state officials, <em>Walker v. Pierce,</em> Civ. No. 71 75 (SC, July 28, 1975.), <em>aff\'d in part and rev\'d in part,</em> 560 F.2d 609 (CA4 1977), <em>cert. denied,</em> 434 U.S. 1075 (1978). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Following denial of appellant\'s motion to dismiss, App. 77-82, she testified in her own behalf and called Allen, a number of ACLU representatives, and several character witnesses. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The panel filed a report recommending that appellant be found guilty of soliciting a client on behalf of the ACLU, in violation of Disciplinary Rules (DR) 2-103(D)(5)(a) and (c) [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and 2-104(A)(5) [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] of the Supreme Court of South </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 436 U. S. 419</a></p><p> Carolina, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and that a private reprimand be issued.  It noted that</p>\n<p>"[t]he evidence is inconclusive as to whether [appellant] solicited Mrs. Williams on her own behalf, but she did solicit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 436 U. S. 420</a></p><p> Mrs. Williams on behalf of the ACLU, which would benefit financially in the event of successful prosecution of the suit for money damages."</p>\n<p>The panel determined that appellant violated DR 2-103(D)(5)</p>\n<p>"by attempting to solicit a client for a nonprofit organization which, as its primary purpose, renders legal services, where respondent\'s associate is a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 436 U. S. 421</a></p><p> staff counsel for the non-profit organization."</p>\n<p>Appellant also was found to have violated DR 104(A)(5) because she solicited Williams, after providing unsolicited legal advice, to join in a prospective class action for damages and other relief that was to be brought by the ACLU.</p>\n<p>After a hearing on January 9, 1976, the full Board approved the panel report and administered a private reprimand.  On March 17, 1977, the Supreme Court of South Carolina entered an order which adopted verbatim the findings and conclusions of the panel report and increased the sanction, <em>sua sponte,</em> to a public reprimand.  268 S.C. 259, 233 S.E.2d 301.</p>\n<p>On July 9, 1977, appellant filed a jurisdictional statement and this appeal was docketed.  We noted probable jurisdiction on October 3, 1977, <em>sub nom. In re Smith,</em> 434 U.S. 814.  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This appeal concerns the tension between contending values of considerable moment to the legal profession and to society.  Relying upon <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span> (1963), and its progeny, appellant maintains that her activity involved constitutionally protected expression and association.  In her view, South Carolina has not shown that the discipline meted out to her advances a subordinating state interest in a manner that avoids unnecessary abridgment of First Amendment freedoms. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Appellee counters that appellant\'s letter to Williams falls outside of the protection of <em>Button,</em> and that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 436 U. S. 422</a></p><p> South Carolina acted lawfully in punishing a member of its Bar for solicitation.</p>\n<p>The States enjoy broad power to regulate "the practice of professions within their boundaries," and</p>\n<p>"[t]he interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great, since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been \'officers of the courts.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U. S. 773</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html#792">421 U. S. 792</a></span> (1975).  For example, we decide today in <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html">436 U. S. 447</a></span>, that the States may vindicate legitimate regulatory interests through proscription, in certain circumstances, of in-person solicitation by lawyers who seek to communicate purely commercial offers of legal assistance to lay persons.</p>\n<p>Unlike the situation in <em>Ohralik,</em> however, appellant\'s act of solicitation took the form of a letter to a woman with whom appellant had discussed the possibility of seeking redress for an allegedly unconstitutional sterilization.  This was not in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain.  Appellant was communicating an offer of free assistance by attorneys associated with the ACLU, not an offer predicated on entitlement to a share of any monetary recovery.  And her actions were undertaken to express personal political beliefs and to advance the civil liberties objectives of the ACLU, rather than to derive financial gain.  The question presented in this case is whether, in light of the values protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, these differences materially affect the scope of state regulation of the conduct of lawyers.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>NAACP v. Button, supra,</em> the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia had held that the activities of members and staff attorneys of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and its affiliate, the Virginia State Conference of NAACP Branches (Conference), constituted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 436 U.

Although the NAACP representatives and staff attorneys had</p>\n<p>"a right to peaceably assemble with the members of the branches and other groups to discuss with them and advise them relative to their legal rights in matters concerning racial segregation,"</p>\n<p>the court found no constitutional protection for efforts to "solicit prospective litigants to authorize the filing of suits" by NAACP-compensated attorneys.  <em>Id.</em> at 159, 116 S.E.2d at 68-69.</p>\n<p>This Court reversed:</p>\n<p>"We hold that the activities of the NAACP, its affiliates and legal staff shown on this record are modes of expression and association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments which Virginia may not prohibit, under its power to regulate the legal profession, as improper solicitation of legal business violative of [state law] and the Canons of Professional Ethics."</p>\n<p>371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#428">371 U.

Since the Virginia statute sought to regulate expressive and associational conduct at the core of the First Amendment\'s protective ambit, the <em>Button</em> Court insisted that "government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity."  371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#433">371 U.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The Court found inadequate the first justification because of an absence of evidence of NAACP interference with the actual conduct of litigation, or neglect or harassment of clients, and because the statute, as construed, was not drawn narrowly to advance the asserted goal.  It rejected the analogy to the common law offenses because of an absence of proof that malicious intent or the prospect of pecuniary gain inspired the NAACP-sponsored litigation.  It also found a lack of proof that a serious danger of conflict of interest marked the relationship between the NAACP and its member and nonmember Negro litigants.

[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The Supreme Court of South Carolina found appellant to have engaged in unethical conduct because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 436 U. S. 427</a></p><p> she</p>\n<p>"\'solicit[ed] a client for a non-profit organization, which, as its primary purpose, renders legal services, where respondent\'s associate is a staff counsel for the non-profit organization.\'"</p>\n<p>268 S.C. at 269, 233 S.E.2d at 306. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  It rejected appellant\'s First Amendment defenses by distinguishing <em>Button</em> from the case before it.  Whereas the NAACP in that case was primarily a "<em>political\'" organization that used "`litigation as an adjunct to the overriding political aims of the organization,\'" the ACLU "`has as one of its primary purposes the rendition of legal services.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 268, 269, 233 S.E.2d at 305, 306.  The court also intimated that the ACLU\'s policy of requesting an award of counsel fees indicated that the organization might "`benefit financially in the event of successful prosecution of the suit for money damages.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 263, 233 S.E.2d at 303.\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the disciplinary panel did not permit full factual development of the aims and practices of the ACLU, <em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra,</em> the record does not support the state court\'s effort to draw a meaningful distinction between the ACLU and the NAACP.  From all that appears, the ACLU and its local chapters, much like the NAACP and its local affiliates in <em>Button,</em> "[engage] in extensive educational and lobbying activities" and</p>\n<p>"also [devote] much of [their] funds and energies to an extensive program of assisting certain kinds of litigation on behalf of [their] declared purposes."</p>\n<p>371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#419">371 U.

For the ACLU, as for the NAACP, "litigation is not a technique of resolving private differences"; it is "a form of political expression" and "political association."  371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#429">371 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>We find equally unpersuasive any suggestion that the level of constitutional scrutiny in this case should be lowered because of a possible benefit to the ACLU.  The discipline administered to appellant was premised solely on the possibility of financial benefit to the organization, rather than any possibility of pecuniary gain to herself, her associates, or the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the <em>Walker v. Pierce</em> litigation. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  It is conceded that appellant received no compensation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 436 U. S. 429</a></p><p> for any of the activities in question.  It is also undisputed that neither the ACLU nor any lawyer associated with it would have shared in any monetary recovery by the plaintiffs in <em>Walker v. Pierce.</em>  If Williams had elected to bring suit, and had been represented by staff lawyers for the ACLU, the situation would have been similar to that in <em>Button,</em> where the lawyers for the NAACP were "organized as a staff and paid by" that organization.  371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#434">371 U.

Allen,</em> 493 F.2d 614, 622 (CA5 1974); <em>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</em> 371 F.Supp. 507, 523 (Mass.), <em>aff\'d,</em> 504 F.2d 1017 (CA1 1974), <em>cert. denied,</em> 421 U.S. 910 (1975), and by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Inc., <em>see, e.g., Bradley v. Richmond School Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/696/case.html">416 U. S. 696</a></span> (1974); <em>Reynolds v. Coomey,</em> 567 F.2d 1166, 1167 (CA1 1978).  In any event, in a case of this kind there are differences between counsel fees awarded by a court and traditional fee-paying arrangements which militate against a presumption </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 436 U. S. 430</a></p><p> that ACLU sponsorship of litigation is motivated by considerations of pecuniary gain, rather than by its widely recognized goal of vindicating civil liberties.  Counsel fees are awarded in the discretion of the court; awards are not drawn from the plaintiff\'s recovery, and are usually premised on a successful outcome; and the amounts awarded often may not correspond to fees generally obtainable in private litigation.  Moreover, under prevailing law during the events in question, an award of counsel fees in federal litigation was available only in limited circumstances. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  And even if there had been an award during the period in question, it would have gone to the central fund of the ACLU. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Although such benefit to the organization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 436 U. S. 431</a></p><p> may increase with the maintenance of successful litigation, the same situation obtains with voluntary contributions and foundation support, which also may rise with ACLU victories in important areas of the law.  That possibility, standing alone, offers no basis for equating the work of lawyers associated with the ACLU or the NAACP with that of a group that exists for the primary purpose of financial gain through the recovery of counsel fees.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 20, <em>supra.</em> [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant\'s letter of August 30, 1973, to Mrs. Williams thus comes within the generous zone of First Amendment protection reserved for associational freedoms.  The ACLU engages in litigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and association, as well as a means of communicating useful information to the public.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F32" name="T32">n</a> 32, <em>infra; cf.

As <em>Button</em> indicates, and as appellant offered to prove at the disciplinary hearing, <em>see</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra,</em> the efficacy of litigation as a means of advancing the cause of civil liberties often depends on the ability to make legal assistance available to suitable litigants.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 436 U.

Brief for Appellee 37-49.  We do not dispute the importance of these interests.  This Court\'s decision in <em>Button</em> makes clear, however, that "[b]road prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect," and that "[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms."  371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#438">371 U.

Because of the danger of censorship through selective enforcement of broad prohibitions, and "[b]ecause First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 436 U.

Under DR 2-103(D)(5), a lawyer employed by the ACLU or a similar organization may never give unsolicited advice to a lay person that he retain the organization\'s free services, and it would seem that one who merely assists or maintains a cooperative relationship with the organization also must suppress the giving of such advice if he or anyone associated with the organization will be involved in the ultimate litigation.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 334.  Notwithstanding appellee\'s concession in this Court, it is far from clear that a lawyer may communicate the organization\'s offer of legal assistance at an informational gathering such as the July, 1973, meeting in Aiken without breaching the literal terms of the Rule.  <em>Cf.</em> Memorandum of Complainant, Apr. 8, 1975, p. 9. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Moreover, the Disciplinary Rules in question permit punishment for mere solicitation unaccompanied by proof of any of the substantive evils that appellee maintains were present in this case.  In sum, the Rules in their present form have a distinct potential for dampening the kind of "cooperative activity that would make advocacy of litigation meaningful," <em>Button, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#438">371 U.

S. 447</a></span>, that the State may proscribe in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain under circumstances likely to result in adverse consequences, cannot be applied to appellant\'s activity on behalf of the ACLU.  Although a showing of potential danger may suffice in the former context, appellant may not be disciplined unless her activity in fact involved the type of misconduct at which South Carolina\'s broad prohibition is said to be directed.</p>\n<p>The record does not support appellee\'s contention that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 436 U. S. 435</a></p><p> undue influence, overreaching, misrepresentation, or invasion of privacy actually occurred in this case.  Appellant\'s letter of August 30, 1973, followed up the earlier meeting -- one concededly protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments -- by notifying Williams that the ACLU would be interested in supporting possible litigation.  The letter imparted additional information material to making an informed decision about whether to authorize litigation, and permitted Williams an opportunity, which she exercised, for arriving at a deliberate decision.  The letter was not facially misleading; indeed, it offered "to explain what is involved so you can understand what is going on."  The transmittal of this letter -- as contrasted with in-person solicitation -- involved no appreciable invasion of privacy; [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] nor did it afford any significant opportunity for overreaching or coercion.  Moreover, the fact that there was a written communication lessens substantially the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 436 U. S. 436</a></p><p> difficulty of policing solicitation practices that do offend valid rules of professional conduct.  <em>See Ohralik, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#466">436 U.

The same result follows from the facts of this case.

The staff member will bring printed forms to the meeting authorizing him, and other NAACP or [NAACP Legal] Defense Fund attorneys of his designation, to represent the signers in legal proceedings to achieve desegregation.  On occasion, blank forms have been signed by litigants, upon the understanding that a member or members of the legal staff, with or without assistance from other NAACP lawyers, or from the Defense Fund, would handle the case.  It is usual, after obtaining authorizations, for the staff lawyer to bring into the case the other staff members in the area where suit is to be brought, and sometimes to bring in lawyers from the national organization or the Defense Fund.

The absence of discipline in <em>Button</em> was not due to an absence of lawyer involvement in solicitation.  Indeed, from all that appears, no one was disciplined; the case came to this Court in the posture of an anticipatory action for declaratory relief.  The state court\'s decree made quite clear that "the solicitation of legal business by . . .

In light of these circumstances, and Williams\' own acknowledgment that appellant "did not attempt to persuade or pressure me to file this lawsuit," <em>id.</em> at 52, appellant did not go beyond the pale of constitutional protection in writing a single letter for the purpose of imparting new information material to a decision whether or not to authorize litigation, and inquiring "if you are interested, let me know, and I\'ll let you know when we will come down to talk to you about it."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the decision whether or not to support a particular litigation is made in accordance with the ACLU\'s broader objectives, the organization\'s declared policy is to avoid all interference with the attorney-client relationship after that decision has been made.  <em>See</em> 1976 Policy Guide of the American Civil Liberties Union, Policy #513, p 305.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>We are not presented in this case with a situation where the income of the lawyer who solicits the prospective litigant or who engages in the actual representation of the solicited client rises or falls with the outcome of the particular litigation.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#428">436 U.

S. 447</a></span>, the Court tells its own tale of two lawyers:  one tale ends happily for the lawyer, and one does not.  If we were given the latitude of novelists in deciding between happy and unhappy endings for the heroes and villains of our tales, I might well join in the Court\'s disposition of both cases.  But, under our federal system, it is for the States to decide which lawyers shall be admitted to the Bar and remain there; this Court may interfere only if the State\'s decision is rendered impermissible by the United States Constitution.  We can, of course, develop a jurisprudence of epithets and slogans in this area, in which "ambulance chasers" suffer one fate and "civil liberties lawyers" another.  But I remain unpersuaded by the Court\'s opinions in these two cases that there is a principled basis for concluding that the First and Fourteenth Amendments forbid South Carolina from disciplining Primus here, but permit Ohio to discipline Ohralik </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 436 U. S. 441</a></p><p> in the companion case.  I believe that both South Carolina and Ohio acted within the limits prescribed by those Amendments, and I would therefore affirm the judgment in each case.</p>\n<p>This Court said in <em>United Transportation Union v. Michigan Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/576/case.html">401 U. S. 576</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/576/case.html#585">401 U. S. 585</a></span> (1971):</p>\n<p>"The common thread running through our decisions in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/371/415/case.html">NAACP v. Button,</a></span></em> [371 U.S. 415 (1963),] <em>Trainmen [v. Virginia Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/377/1/case.html">377 U.

S. 217</a></span> (1967),] is that collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protection of the First Amendment."</p>\n<p>The Court today ignores the absence of this common thread from the fabric of this case, and decides that South Carolina may not constitutionally discipline a member of its Bar for badgering a lay citizen to take part in "collective activity" which she has never desired to join.</p>\n<p>Neither <em>Button</em> nor any other decision of this Court compels a State to permit an attorney to engage in uninvited solicitation on an individual basis.  Further, I agree with the Court\'s statement in the companion case that the State has a strong interest in forestalling the evils that result "when a lawyer, a professional trained in the art of persuasion, personally solicits an unsophisticated, injured, or distressed lay person."  <em>Ohralik, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#465">436 U.

The reversal of the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina thus seems to me quite unsupported by previous decisions or by any principle which may be abstracted from them.</p>\n<p>In distinguishing between Primus\' protected solicitation and Ohralik\'s unprotected solicitation, the Court lamely declares:</p>\n<p>"We have not discarded the \'common sense\' distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#455">436 U. S. 455</a></span>-456.  Yet to the extent that this "common sense" distinction focuses on the content of the speech, it is at least suspect under many of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 436 U. S. 442</a></p><p> this Court\'s First Amendment cases, <em>see, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/92/case.html">408 U.

S. 96</a></span>-98 (1972), and to the extent it focuses upon the motive of the speaker, it is subject to manipulation by clever practitioners.  If Albert Ohralik, like Edna Primus, viewed litigation "<em>not [as] a technique of resolving private differences,\'" but as "`a form of political expression\' and `political association,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#428">436 U.

S. 429</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#431">371 U. S. 431</a></span>, for all that appears, he would be restored to his right to practice.  And we may be sure that the next lawyer in Ohralik\'s shoes who is disciplined for similar conduct will come here cloaked in the prescribed mantle of "political association" to assure that insurance companies do not take unfair advantage of policyholders.\n</em></p>\n<p>This absence of any principled distinction between the two cases is made all the more unfortunate by the radical difference in scrutiny brought to bear upon state regulation in each area.  Where solicitation proposes merely a commercial transaction, the Court recognizes "the need for prophylactic regulation in furtherance of the State\'s interest in protecting the lay public."  <em>Ohralik, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#468">436 U. S. 468</a></span>.  On the other hand, in some circumstances (at least in those identical to the instant case) [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] "[w]here political expression or association is at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 436 U. S. 443</a></p><p> issue," a member of the Bar "may not be disciplined unless her activity in fact involve[s] the type of misconduct at which South Carolina\'s broad prohibition is said to be directed."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#434">436 U. S. 434</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I do not believe that any State will be able to determine with confidence the area in which it may regulate prophylactically and the area in which it may regulate only upon a specific showing of harm.  Despite the Court\'s assertion to the contrary, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#438">436 U. S. 438</a></span> n. 32, the difficulty of drawing distinctions on the basis of the content of the speech or the motive of the speaker is a valid reason for avoiding the undertaking where a more objective standard is readily available.  I believe that constitutional inquiry must focus on the character of the conduct which the State seeks to regulate, and not on the motives of the individual lawyers or the nature of the particular litigation involved.  The State is empowered to discipline for conduct which it deems detrimental to the public interest unless foreclosed from doing so by our cases construing the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>In <em>Button,</em> this Court recognized the right of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to engage in collective activity, including the solicitation of potential plaintiffs from outside its ranks, for the purpose of instituting and maintaining litigation to achieve the desegregation of public schools.  The NAACP utilized letters, bulletins, and petition drives, 371 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#422">371 U.

S. 444</a></p><p> plaintiffs.  As described in <em>Button,</em> lawyers played only a limited role in this solicitation:</p>\n<p>"Typically, a local NAACP branch will invite a member of the legal staff to explain to a meeting of parents and children the legal steps necessary to achieve desegregation.  The staff member will bring printed forms to the meeting, authorizing him, and other NAACP or Defense Fund attorneys of his designation, to represent the signers in legal proceedings to achieve desegregation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#421">371 U. S. 421</a></span>.  The Court held that the organization could not be punished by the Commonwealth of Virginia for solicitation on the basis of its role in instituting desegregation litigation. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Here, South Carolina has not attempted to punish the ACLU or any laymen associated with it. Gary Allen, who was the instigator of the effort to sue Dr. Pierce, remains as free as before to solicit potential plaintiffs for future litigation.  Likewise, Primus remains as free a before to address gatherings of the sort described in <em>Button</em> to advise potential plaintiffs of their legal rights.  Primus\' first contact with Williams took place at such a gathering, and South Carolina, evidently in response to <em>Button</em>, has not attempted to discipline </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 436 U. S. 445</a></p><p> her for her part in that meeting.  It has disciplined her for initiating further contact on an individual basis with Williams, who had not expressed any desire to become involved in the collective activity being organized by the ACLU.  While <em>Button</em> appears to permit such individual solicitation for political purposes by lay members of the organization, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#422">371 U. S. 422</a></span>, it nowhere explicitly permits such activity on the part of lawyers.</p>\n<p>As the Court understands the Disciplinary Rule enforced by South Carolina,</p>\n<p>"a lawyer employed by the ACLU or a similar organization may never give unsolicited advice to a lay person that he or she retain the organization\'s free services."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#433">436 U. S. 433</a></span>.  That prohibition seems to me entirely reasonable.  A State may rightly fear that members of its Bar have powers of persuasion not possessed by laymen, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#464">436 U. S. 464</a></span>-465, and it may also fear that such persuasion may be as potent in writing as it is in person.  Such persuasion may draw an unsophisticated layman into litigation contrary to his own best interests, <em>compare ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#434">436 U. S. 434</a></span>-438, <em>with Ohralik, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#464">436 U. S. 464</a></span>-467, and it may force other citizens of South Carolina to defend against baseless litigation which would not otherwise have been brought.  I cannot agree that a State must prove such harmful consequences in each case simply because an organization such as the ACLU or the NAACP is involved.</p>\n<p>I cannot share the Court\'s confidence that the danger of such consequences is minimized simply because a lawyer proceeds from political conviction, rather than for pecuniary gain. A State may reasonably fear that a lawyer\'s desire to resolve "substantial civil liberties questions," 268 S.C. 259, 263, 233 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1977), may occasionally take precedence over his duty to advance the interests of his client.  It is even more reasonable to fear that a lawyer in such circumstances will be inclined to pursue both culpable and blameless defendants to the last ditch in order to achieve his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 436 U. S. 446</a></p><p> ideological goals. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Although individual litigants, including the ACLU, may be free to use the courts for such purposes, South Carolina is likewise free to restrict the activities of the members of its Bar who attempt to persuade them to do so.  I can only conclude that the discipline imposed upon Primus does not violate the Constitution, and I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court carefully reserves judgment on factual circumstances in any way distinguishable from those presented here.  For instance, the Court suggests that different considerations would arise if Primus herself had received any benefit from the solicitation, or if her income depended in any way on the outcome of the litigation.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#428">436 U.

Likewise, the Court emphasizes that the lawyers conducting the litigation would have taken no share had attorney\'s fees been awarded by the court.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#430">436 U. S. 430</a></span> n. 24.  Finally, the Court points out that Williams had not "communicated unambiguously a decision against litigation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#435">436 U. S. 435</a></span> n. 28, that the solicitation was not effected in person, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#435">436 U. S. 435</a></span>, and that legal services were offered free of charge, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#437">436 U. S. 437</a></span>.  All these reservations seem to imply that a State might be able to raise an absolute prohibition against any of these factual variations, even "[i]n the context of political expression and association."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/412/case.html#437">436 U.

On the other hand, in Ohralik, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/447/case.html#463">436 U. S. 463</a></span> n. 20, the Court appears to give a broader reading to today\'s holding.</p>\n<p>"We hold today in Primus that a lawyer who engages in solicitation as a form of protected political association generally may not be disciplined without proof of actual wrongdoing that the State constitutionally may proscribe."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Of all our cases recognizing the protected status of "collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts," <em>United Transportation Union v.

Thus, the Court\'s conclusion today that a State may not discipline a member of its bar for soliciting an individual not already engaged in the sort of collective activity protected under our cases is as unprecedented as it is unsound.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>In the case with which Primus was concerned, the last ditch was the denial of certiorari in this Court after the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had held that Pierce had not, in fact, acted under color of state law.  <em>Walker v.
