The petition set forth that the petitioners were citizens of the United States, citizens and residents of the State of Virginia, and of the Third Congressional District of that state, and entitled to vote at the election held on November 4, 1902, for a member of the House of Representatives of the United States from that district; that they applied to the proper registration board for registration, and were refused.  It was further alleged that, in 1901, a constitutional convention was assembled in Virginia; that it framed a new constitution; that it did not submit such constitution to the people for approval, but, by a vote of forty-seven to thirty-eight, ordained it as the organic law of the state.  Attached to the petition were copies of the constitution, of a schedule making provisions for putting in force the new constitution without inconvenience, and of an ordinance providing for the registration of voters, all of which were adopted by the same convention.  The petitioners also charge that the purpose of the party in power was the disfranchisement of the colored voters of the state, and specifically set forth how this disfranchisement was to be accomplished.  They averred that, at the election held on November 4, 1902, only the registration lists provided for by the ordinance were recognized; that abstracts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 194 U.

The prayer of the petition was that a writ of prohibition issue to the defendants</p>\n<p>"prohibiting them, and each of them, from considering, canvassing, counting, determining upon, or certifying or otherwise acting upon, any returns or abstracts of returns in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, purporting to be returns of election held in the State of Virginia, Tuesday, November 4, 1902, for representatives in Congress from the State of Virginia, or in any wise dealing with or certifying the results of said returns as returns of a lawful election, held in Virginia on the date aforesaid.  That by reason of the matters and things hereinabove set forth, said pretended election, and any and all precinct, county, district, or state returns made thereunder, may be held to be null, void, and of no affect, and the said board of state canvassers, and the members thereof, may be prohibited from in any wise proceeding to act upon the same as lawfully before them for their consideration.

S. 151</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p><em>Mills v. Green,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/159/651/case.html">159 U. S. 651</a></span>, is decisive, and compels a dismissal of the writ of error.  That was a suit in equity, alleging the calling of a convention to revise the Constitution of South Carolina, and seeking to enjoin an alleged illegal, partial, and void registration by which the plaintiff, and others like him, would be deprived of the right to vote for delegates to the convention.  An injunction was granted by the circuit court, but was dissolved by the circuit court of appeals, and the suit dismissed.  Thereupon the election was held, the convention met and entered upon the discharge of its duties.  An appeal to this Court from the order of dismissal made by the circuit court of appeals was dismissed on the ground that the object of the suit could no longer be attained.  Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion, said (pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/159/651/case.html#653">159 U. S. 653</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/159/651/case.html#657">159 U. S. 657</a></span>-658):</p>\n<p>"The duty of this Court, as of every other judicial tribunal, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 194 U. S. 152</a></p><p> is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.  It necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this Court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal. . . .  In the case at bar, the whole object of the bill was to secure a right to vote at the election, to be held, as the bill alleged, on the third Tuesday of August, 1895, of delegates to the constitutional convention of South Carolina.  Before this appeal was taken by the plaintiff from the decree of the circuit court of appeals dismissing his bill, that date had passed, and, before the entry of the appeal in this Court, the convention had assembled, pursuant to the statute of South Carolina of 1894, by which the convention had been called.  21 Stat. of S.C. pp. 802, 803.  The election of the delegates and the assembling of the convention are public matters, to be taken notice of by the court, without formal plea or proof. . . .  It is obvious, therefore, that even if the bill could properly be held to present a case within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, no relief within the scope of the bill could now be granted."</p>\n<p><em>See also Codlin v. Kohlhausen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/181/151/case.html">181 U. S. 151</a></span>; <em>Tennessee v. Condon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/189/64/case.html">189 U. S. 64</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The case before us is one in prohibition.  It is so declared by the petitioners in their petition, and the thing sought to be prohibited was a canvass of the votes cast at the election on November 4, 1902.  The facts alleged in respect to the Constitution, the purpose of the dominant party, the action of the convention, the refusal to submit the proposed Constitution to the vote of the people, and the registration ordinance were all stated for the purpose of showing that the election on November 4, 1902, was illegal, and that there ought to be no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 194 U. S. 153</a></p><p> canvass of the returns cast at that election.  The prayer of the petitioners specifically is to restrain such canvass.  Even the general clause at the close of the prayer is "for such other and further orders in the premises as shall and may make the prayer of your petitioners effectual."  But, as shown by the affidavit, and as indeed we might perhaps take judicial notice by the presence in the House of Representatives of the individuals elected at that election from the various congressional districts of Virginia, the thing sought to be prohibited has been done, and cannot be undone by any order of court.  The canvass has been made, certificates of election have been issued, the House of Representatives (which is the sole judge of the qualifications of its members) has admitted the parties holding the certificates to seats in that body, and any adjudication which this Court might make would be only an ineffectual decision of the question whether or not these petitioners were wronged by what has been fully accomplished.  Under those circumstances, there is nothing but a moot case remaining, and the motion to dismiss must be sustained.</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed without costs to either party.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
