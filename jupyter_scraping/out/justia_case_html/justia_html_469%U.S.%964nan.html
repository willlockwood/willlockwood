WILKES<br/>v.<br/> UNITED STATES<br/>No. 83-6943 </p><p> Supreme Court of the United States </p></b><p><b> October 29, 1984</b> </p><p> On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. </p><p> The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. </p><p></p><p> Justice WHITE, dissenting. </p><p> Posing as a Social Security Administration employee, petitioner Warren Wilkes told a benefit recipient that Social Security overpayments had been made. Wilkes demanded a return of the overpayments, and in this manner repeatedly obtained money. As a result, Wilkes was charged with violating the second clause of 18 U.S.C. 912, which prohibits demanding or obtaining anything of value while impersonating an officer or employee of a United States agency or department.* </p><p> At the end of the prosecution\'s case, Wilkes moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to charge intent to defraud in any of the counts. The District Court denied the motion. The judge found that although the indictment did not specifically allege an intent to defraud, it did charge, in the exact terminology of the statute, that petitioner pretended to be an employee of the United States acting under the authority thereof, and that acting as such and in such pretended character he demanded and obtained money from the victim in violation of the law. The jury found Wilkes guilty on all counts. The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that since the intent to defraud language was deleted from the statute in a 1948 revision, such an intent need not be specifically pleaded and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="965">Page 469 U.S. 964 , 965</a></p><p> proved. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/732/1154/">732 F.2d 1154</a> (1984).

The Fifth Circuit views congressional deletion of the intent to defraud language as merely an attempt to make statutory wording conform to authoritative judicial construction.
