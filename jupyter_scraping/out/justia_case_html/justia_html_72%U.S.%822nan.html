Security for prosecution should be taken by the judge on signing the citation, but if this duty be omitted or defectively performed, a remedy can be applied here on motion.</p>\n<p>In the present case, a bond, admitted to be sufficient for costs of prosecution, whether given in time to make appeal operate as a supersedeas or not, was filed in the court below before removal to this Court.</p>\n<p>The motion to dismiss the appeal must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Denied.</em></p>\n<p>* <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/69/96/case.html">Brobst v.
