Because of accumulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most recently in 2009.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both received the generic drug from their pharmacists.  After taking the drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskinesia.  In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took (Manufacturers).  Each respondent alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that long-term metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufacturers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate warning labels.  In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by requiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopramide as was mandated at the time for Reglan.  The Fifth and Eighth Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not pre-empted.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">588 F.\xc2\xa03d 603 and 593 F.\xc2\xa03d 428, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part III\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, concluding that federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus pre-empt, these state claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314, 17\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because pre-emption analysis requires a comparison between federal and state law, the Court begins by identifying the state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufacturers.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0State tort law requires a manufacturer that is, or should be, aware of its drug\xe2\x80\x99s danger to label it in a way that renders it reasonably safe.  Respondents pleaded that the Manufacturers knew, or should have known, both that the long-term use of their products carried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk.  Taking these allegations as true, the state-law duty required the Manufacturers to use a different, stronger label than the one they actually used.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs\xe2\x80\x99 safety labels.  A manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate.  Although the same rules originally applied to all drugs, the 1984 law commonly called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allows a generic drug manufacturer to gain FDA approval simply by showing that its drug is equivalent to an already-approved brand-name drug, and that the safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that approved for the brand-name drug.  Respondents contend that federal law nevertheless provides avenues through which the Manufacturers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here.  These include: (1) the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchanges-being-effected\xe2\x80\x9d (CBE) process, which permits drug manufacturers, without preapproval, to add or strengthen a warning label; and (2) sending \xe2\x80\x9cDear Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d letters providing additional warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals.  However, the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have used either of these processes to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels.   The Court defers to the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s views because they are not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations, and there is no other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment.  <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461, 462.  Assuming, without deciding, that the FDA is correct that federal law nevertheless required the Manufacturers to ask for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in convincing the brand-name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, the Court turns to the pre-emption question.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Where state and federal law directly conflict, state law must give way.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/555/index.html">555 U. S. 555</a>, 583.  Such a conflict exists where it is \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freightliner Corp.</em> v. <em>Myrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/280/index.html">514 U. S. 280</a>, 287.   Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314, 17\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court finds impossibility here.  If the Manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide, they would have violated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same as the corresponding brand-name drug labels.  Thus, it was impossible for them to comply with both state and federal law.  And even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA help in strengthening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty exists, they would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty.  State law demanded a safer label; it did not require communication with the FDA about the possibility of a safer label.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the argument that the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emption defense fails because they failed to ask the FDA for help in changing the corresponding brand-name label.  The proper question for \xe2\x80\x9cimpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d analysis is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.  See <em>Wyeth, supra</em>, at 573.  Accepting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument would render conflict pre-emption largely meaningless by making most conflicts between state and federal law illusory.  In these cases, it is possible<em> </em>that, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label.  But it is also <em>possible </em>that they could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process to them, persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely, or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  If these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and state law from conflicting, it is unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force.  That Clause\xe2\x80\x94which makes federal law \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Law of the Land \xe2\x80\xa6 any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x94cannot be read to permit an approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but meaningless.  Here, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy its state duties without the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s special permission and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently satisfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314, 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0<em>Wyeth</em> is not to the contrary.  The Court there held that a state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and federal law under the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s CBE regulation.  555 U. S., at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers differ, by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 design, from those applicable to generic drug manufacturers.  And different federal statutes and regulations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results.  This Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create similar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme.  Congress and the FDA retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so desire.

The question presented is whether federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus pre-empt, these state-law claims.  We hold that they do.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the movement of food through the digestive system.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopramide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980.  Five years later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto-clopramide.  The drug is commonly used to treat diges-\ntive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disorder.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder.  Studies have shown that up to 29% of patients who take metoclopramide for several years develop this condition.  <em>McNeil</em> v. <em>Wyeth</em>, 462 F.\xc2\xa03d 364, 370, \nn.\xc2\xa05 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &amp; Mackey, Tardive Dyskinesia Risks and Metoclopramide Use Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cisapride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (noting 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia reported to the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s adverse event reporting system by mid-2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times.  In 1985, the label was modified to warn that \xe2\x80\x9ctardive dyskinesia \xe2\x80\xa6 may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,\xe2\x80\x9d and the drug\xe2\x80\x99s package insert added that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]herapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended.\xe2\x80\x9d  Physician\xe2\x80\x99s Desk Reference 1635\xe2\x80\x931636 (41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief).  In 2004, the brand-name Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA approved, a label change to add that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]herapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8 (hereinafter U. S. Brief).  And in 2009, the FDA ordered a black box warning\xe2\x80\x94its strongest\xe2\x80\x94which states: \xe2\x80\x9cTreatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Treatment with metoclopramide \nfor longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Physician\xe2\x80\x99s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed. 2011).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in these consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, respectively.  Both received generic metoclopramide from their pharmacists.  After taking the drug \nas prescribed for several years, both women developed tardive dyskinesia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took (Manufacturers).  Each alleged, as relevant here, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tar-dive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable under state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and Louisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels.  They claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cdespite mounting evidence that long term metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskinesia far greater than that indicated on the label,\xe2\x80\x9d none of the Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately warn of that danger.  <em>Mensing</em> v. <em>Wyeth, Inc.</em>, 588 F.\xc2\xa03d 603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also <em>Demahy</em> v. <em>Actavis, Inc.</em>, 593 F.\xc2\xa03d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law pre-empted the state tort claims.  According to the Manufacturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their brand-name counterparts.  This means, they argued, that it was impossible to simultaneously comply with both federal law and any state tort-law duty that required them to use a different label.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits rejected the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 arguments and held that Men-sing and Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s claims were not pre-empted.  See<em>\n</em>588 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 614; 593 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 449.  We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), consolidated the cases, and now reverse each.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and state law.  We therefore begin by identifying the state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufacturers.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that Minnesota and Louisiana tort law require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product\xe2\x80\x99s danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe.  Under Minnesota law, which applies to Mensing\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the manufacturer \xe2\x80\xa6 of a product has actual or constructive knowledge of \ndanger to users, the \xe2\x80\xa6 manufacturer has a duty to give warning of such dangers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frey</em> v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.</em>, 258 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977).  Similarly, under Louisiana law applicable to Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit, \xe2\x80\x9ca manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s duty to warn includes a duty to provide adequate instructions for safe use of a product.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stahl</em> v. <em>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 254, 269\xe2\x80\x93270 (CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa79:2800.57 (West 2009).  In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on the manufacturer.  See <em>Marks</em> v. <em>OHMEDA, Inc.</em>, 2003\xe2\x80\x931446, pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (La. App. 3/31/04), 871 So. 2d 1148, 1155; <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Badger Min.

They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers knew or should have known that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk.  App. 437\xe2\x80\x93438, 67\xe2\x80\x9369, 94\xe2\x80\x9396.  The parties do not dispute that, if these allegations are true, state law required the Manufacturers to use a different, safer label.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling requirements.  We begin with what is not in dispute.  Under the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7301 <em>et seq.,</em> a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See, <em>e.g., \n</em>21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(b)(1), (d); <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/555/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/555/index.html">555 U. S. 555</a>, 567 (2009).  Meeting those requirements involves costly and lengthy clinical testing.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D. Beers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA Approval Requirements \xc2\xa72.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs.  In 1984, however, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  Under this law, \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric drugs\xe2\x80\x9d can gain FDA approval simply by showing equivalence to a reference listed drug that has already been approved by the FDA.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A).  This allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs in-expensively, without duplicating the clinical trials already performed on the equivalent brand-name drug.  A generic drug application must also \xe2\x80\x9cshow that the [safety and efficacy] labeling proposed \xe2\x80\xa6 is the same as the labeling approved for the [brand-name] drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A)(v); see also \xc2\xa7355(j)(4)(G); Beers \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73.01, 3.03[A].</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufacturers have different federal drug labeling duties.  A brand-name manufacturer seeking new drug approval is responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(b)(1), (d); <em>Wyeth</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 570\xe2\x80\x93571.  A manufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other hand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is the same as the brand name\xe2\x80\x99s.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A)(v); \xc2\xa7355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties do not disagree.  What is in dispute is whether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may change their labels<em> after</em> initial FDA approval.  Mensing and Demahy contend that federal law provided several avenues through which the Manufacturers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here.  The FDA, however, tells us that it interprets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the same\xe2\x80\x94thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing federal duty of \xe2\x80\x9csameness.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.

The agency interprets the CBE regulation to allow changes to generic drug labels only when a generic drug manufacturer changes its label to match an updated brand-name label or to follow the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.  U. S. Brief 15, 16, n.\xc2\xa07 (interpreting 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.94(a)(8)(iv)); U. S. Brief 16, n. 8.  The FDA argues that CBE changes unilaterally made to strengthen a generic drug\xe2\x80\x99s warning label would violate the statutes and regulations requiring a generic drug\xe2\x80\x99s label to match its brand-name counterpart\xe2\x80\x99s.  <em>Id.,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316; see also\n21 U.

Although Mensing and Demahy offer other ways to interpret the regulations, see Brief for Respondents 33\xe2\x80\x9335, we do not find the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 461 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor do Mensing and Demahy suggest there is any other reason to doubt the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  We therefore conclude that the CBE process was not open to the Manufacturers for the sort of change required by state law.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, Mensing and Demahy contend that the Manufacturers could have used \xe2\x80\x9cDear Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d letters to send ad-ditional warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals.  See Brief for Respondents 36; 21 CFR \xc2\xa7200.5.  Again, the FDA disagrees, and we defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDA argues that Dear Doctor letters qualify as \xe2\x80\x9clabeling.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.

A Dear Doctor letter that contained substantial new warning information would not be consistent with the drug\xe2\x80\x99s approved labeling.

Mensing and Demahy offer no argument that the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is plainly erroneous.  See <em>Auer</em>, 519 U. S., at 461.  Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not permit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings through Dear Doctor letters.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have used the CBE process or Dear Doctor letters to strengthen their warning labels, the agency asserts that \na different avenue existed for changing generic drug labels.  According to the FDA, the Manufacturers could have proposed\xe2\x80\x94indeed, were required to propose\xe2\x80\x94stronger warning labels to the agency if they believed such warnings were needed.  U. S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961.

As it explains, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98central premise of fed-\neral drug regulation is that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d U. S.  Brief 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (quoting Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 570\xe2\x80\x93571).  The FDA reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate labeling with the duty of sameness in the following way: Generic drug manufacturers that become aware of safety problems must ask the agency to work toward strengthening the label that applies to both the generic and brand-name equivalent drug.  U. S. Brief 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Manufacturers and the FDA disagree over whether this alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually existed.  The FDA argues that it explained this duty in the preamble to its 1992 regulations implementing the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf a [generic drug manufacturer] believes new safety information should be added to a product\xe2\x80\x99s labeling, it should contact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Manufacturers claim that the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s 19-year-old statement did not create a duty, and that there is no evi-dence of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pursuant to any such duty.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\xe2\x80\x9324; \nReply Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et\xc2\xa0al. 18\xe2\x80\x9322.  Because we ultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty existed, we do not resolve the matter.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To summarize, the relevant state and federal requirements are these: State tort law places a duty directly on all drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label their products.  Taking Mensing and Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true, this duty required the Manufacturers to use a different, stronger label than the label they actually used.  Federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs\xe2\x80\x99 safety labels.  But, we assume, federal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for FDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding generic drug manufacturers could do so as well.  We turn now to the question of pre-emption.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law \xe2\x80\x9cshall be the supreme Law of the Land \xe2\x80\xa6 any Thing \nin the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.

It was not lawful under federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law required of them.  And even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA assistance, they would not have satisfied the requirements of state law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have violated federal law.  Taking Mensing and Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufac-turers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide.  Federal law, however, demanded that ge-neric drug labels be the same at all times as the corres-ponding brand-name drug labels.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.150(b)(10).  Thus, it was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such \na duty exists, does not change this analysis.  Although requesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Man-ufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 federal duty, it would not have satisfied \ntheir state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling.  State law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the Manufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the possibility of a safer label.  Indeed, Mensing and Demahy deny that their state tort claims are based on the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in changing the labels.  Brief for Respondents 53\xe2\x80\x9354; cf. <em>Buckman Co.</em> v. <em>Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Legal Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/341/index.html">531 U.

Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufacturers had asked the FDA for help in changing the corresponding brand-name label, they might eventually have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires.  That is true enough.  The Manufacturers \xe2\x80\x9cfreely concede\xe2\x80\x9d that they could have asked the FDA for help.  PLIVA Brief 48.  If<em> </em>they had done so, and if the FDA decided there was sufficient supporting information, and \nif the FDA undertook negotiations with the brand-name manufacturer, and if adequate label changes were decided on and implemented, then the Manufacturers would have started a Mouse Trap game that eventually led to a better label on generic metoclopramide.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This raises the novel question whether conflict pre-emption should take into account these possible actions by the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer.  Here, what federal law permitted the Manufacturers to do could have changed, even absent a change in the law itself, depending on the actions of the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer.  Federal law does not dictate the text of each generic drug\xe2\x80\x99s label, but rather ties those labels to their brand-name counterparts.  Thus, federal law would permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mensing and Demahy assert that when a private party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to comply with state law depends on approval and assistance from the FDA, proving pre-emption requires that party to demonstrate that the FDA would not have allowed compliance with state law.  Here, they argue, the Manufacturers cannot bear their burden of proving impossibility because they did not even <em>try </em>to start the process that might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer label.  Brief for Respondents 47<em>.</em>  This is a fair argument, but we reject it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question for \xe2\x80\x9cimpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it.  See <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 573 (finding \nno pre-emption where the defendant could \xe2\x80\x9cunilaterally\xe2\x80\x9d do what state law required).  Accepting Mensing and Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s argument would render conflict pre-emption largely meaningless because it would make most conflicts between state and federal law illusory.  We can often imagine that a third party or the Federal Government <em>might </em>do something that makes it lawful for a private party to accomplish under federal law what state law requires of it.  In these cases, it is certainly possible<em> </em>that, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label.  Of course, it is also <em>possible </em>that the Manufacturers could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process to them.  Following Mensing and Demahy\xe2\x80\x99s argument to its logical conclusion, it is also <em>possible </em>that, \nby asking, the Manufacturers could have persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state law from conflicting for Supremacy Clause purposes, it \nis unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  We do not read the Supremacy Clause to permit an approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but meaningless.  The Supremacy Clause, on its face, makes federal law \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Law of the Land\xe2\x80\x9d even absent an express statement by Congress.  U. S.

The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany [state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d is a <em>non ob-stante</em> provision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 238\xe2\x80\x93240, nn. 43\xe2\x80\x9345.  Eighteenth-century legislatures used <em>non obstante </em>provisions to \nspecify the degree to which a new statute was meant to repeal older, potentially conflicting statutes in the same field.  <em>Id.,</em> at 238\xe2\x80\x93240 (citing dozens of statutes from the 1770\xe2\x80\x99s and 1780\xe2\x80\x99s with similar provisions).

The <em>non obstante </em>provision in the Supremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law should be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the provision suggests that courts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law.  Traditionally, courts went to great lengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes, in order to avoid implied repeals.  <em>Warder</em> v. <em>Arell</em>, 2 Va. 282, 296 (1796) (opinion of Roane, J.)

The Manufacturers would be required continually to prove the counterfactual conduct of the FDA and brand-name manufacturer in order to establish the supremacy of federal law.  We do not think the Supremacy Clause contemplates that sort of contingent supremacy.  The <em>non obstante</em> provision suggests that pre-emption analysis should not involve speculation about ways in which federal agency and third-party actions could potentially reconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.  When the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law blocks a private party from independently accomplishing what state law requires, that party has established pre-emption.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently independently under federal law to do what state law requires may sometimes be difficult to determine.<font super="1">  But this is not such a case.

It is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers.  Indeed, it is the special, and different, regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand, bringing more drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public.  But different federal statutes and regulations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results.  We will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create similar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme.

I cannot agree.  We have traditionally held defendants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard: Until today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not been enough to establish pre-emption.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits\xe2\x80\x94and, the Court assumes, requires\xe2\x80\x94generic-drug manufacturers to propose a label change to the FDA when they believe that their labels are inadequate.  If it agrees that the labels are inadequate, the FDA can initiate a change to the brand-name label, triggering a corresponding change to the generic labels.  Once that occurs, a generic manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law and a state-law duty to warn.  Although generic manufacturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases, petitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide (Manufacturers), have shown only that they <em>might</em> have been unable to comply with both federal law and their state-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy.  This, I would hold, is insufficient to sustain their burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion.  It invents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to justify its dilution of the impossibility standard.  It effectively rewrites our decision in <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/555/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/555/index.html">555 U.

And a plurality of the Court tosses aside our repeated admonition that courts should hesitate to conclude that Congress intended to pre-empt state laws governing health and safety.  As a result of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, whether a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or generic drug.  The Court gets one thing right: This outcome \xe2\x80\x9cmakes little sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision affects 75 percent of all prescription drugs dispensed in this country.  The dominant position of generic drugs in the prescription drug market is the result of a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competi-\ntion and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585\xe2\x80\x94commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9cmake available more low cost generic drugs by establishing a generic drug approval procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93857, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa014 (1984).  As the majority explains, to accomplish this goal the amendments establish an abbreviated application process for generic drugs.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; see also 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A).  The abbreviated approval process implements the amendments\xe2\x80\x99 core principle that generic and brand-name drugs must be the \xe2\x80\x9csame\xe2\x80\x9d in nearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things, that its product has the same active ingredients as an approved brand-name drug; that \xe2\x80\x9cthe route of adminis-tration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new \ndrug are the same\xe2\x80\x9d as the brand-name drug; and that its product is \xe2\x80\x9cbioequivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to the brand-name drug.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv).  By eliminating the need for generic manufacturers to prove their drugs\xe2\x80\x99 safety and efficacy independently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market much less expensively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The States have also acted to expand consumption of low-cost generic drugs.  In the years leading up to passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, States enacted legislation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs when filling prescriptions for brand-name drugs.  Christensen, Kirking, Ascione, Welage, &amp; Gaither, Drug Product Selection: Legal Issues, 41 J. Am. Pharmaceutical Assn. 868, 869 (2001).  Currently, all States have some form of generic substitution law.  See<em> ibid.</em>  Some States require generic substitution in certain circumstances.  Dept. of Health and Human Servs., ASPE Issue Brief: Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7 (2010) (hereinafter Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs);[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] see, <em>e.g.</em>, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Educ. Law Ann. \xc2\xa76816\xe2\x80\x93a (West 2010).  Others permit, but do not require, substitution.  Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7; see, <em>e.g.</em>, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code Ann. \xc2\xa74073 (West Supp. 2011).  Some States require patient consent to substitution, and all States \xe2\x80\x9callow the physician to specify that the brand name must be prescribed, although with different levels of effort from the physician.\xe2\x80\x9d  Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These legislative efforts to expand production and consumption of generic drugs have proved wildly successful.  It is estimated that in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman Amendments were enacted, generic drugs constituted 19 percent of drugs sold in this country.  Congressional Bud-get Office, How Increased Competition from Generic Drugs Has Affected Prices and Returns in the Pharmaceutical Industry 27 (1998).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Today, they dominate the market.  See Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 2 (generic drugs constituted 75 percent of all dispensed prescription drugs in 2009).  Ninety percent of drugs for which a \ngeneric version is available are now filled with generics.  <em>Id.</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In many cases, once generic versions of a \ndrug enter the market, the brand-name manufacturer stops selling the brand-name drug altogether.  See Brief for Marc T. Law et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 18 (citing studies showing that anywhere from one-third to one-half of \ngeneric drugs no longer have a marketed brand-name equivalent).  Reflecting the success of their products, many generic manufacturers, including the Manufacturers and their <em>amici</em>, are huge, multinational companies.  In total, generic drug manufacturers sold an estimated $66 billion of drugs in this country in 2009.  See <em>id.</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, to obtain FDA approval a generic manufacturer must generally show that its drug is the same as an approved brand-name drug.  It need not conduct clinical trials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug.  This does not mean, however, that a generic manufacturer has no duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its products.  The FDA has limited resources to conduct postapproval monitoring of drug safety.  See <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 578.  Manufacturers, we have recognized, \xe2\x80\x9chave superior access to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 578\xe2\x80\x93579.  Federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers\xe2\x80\x94both brand-name and generic\xe2\x80\x94to monitor the safety of their products.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under federal law, generic manufacturers must \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.80(b);[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] see also \xc2\xa7314.98 (making \xc2\xa7314.80 applicable to generic manufacturers); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6, and n.\xc2\xa02 \n(hereinafter U. S. Brief).  They must review all reports \nof adverse drug experiences received from \xe2\x80\x9cany source.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314.80(b).  If a manufacturer receives a report of a serious and unexpected adverse drug experience, it must re-port the event to the FDA within 15 days and must \xe2\x80\x9cpromptly investigate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314.80(c)(1)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  Most other adverse drug experiences must be reported on a quarterly or yearly basis.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  \xc2\xa7314.80(c)(2).  Generic manufacturers must also submit to the FDA an annual report summarizing \xe2\x80\x9csignificant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, ef-fectiveness, or labeling of the drug product,\xe2\x80\x9d including a \xe2\x80\x9cdescription of actions the [manufacturer] has taken or intends to take as a result of this new information.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314.81(b)(2)(i); see also \xc2\xa7314.98(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Generic manufacturers, the majority assumes, also bear responsibility under federal law for monitoring the adequacy of their warnings.  I agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that generic manufacturers are not permitted unilaterally to change their labels through the \xe2\x80\x9cchanges-being-effected\xe2\x80\x9d (CBE) process or to issue additional warnings through \xe2\x80\x9cDear Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d letters.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939.  According to the FDA, however, that generic manufacturers cannot disseminate additional warnings on their own does not mean that federal law permits them to remain idle when they conclude that their labeling is inadequate.  FDA regulations require that labeling \xe2\x80\x9cbe revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.57(e) (2006), currently codified at 21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.80(e) (2010); see also <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 570\xe2\x80\x93571.  The FDA construes this regulation to oblige generic manufacturers \xe2\x80\x9cto seek to revise their labeling and provide FDA with supporting information about risks\xe2\x80\x9d when they believe that additional warnings are necessary.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  U. S. Brief 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Manufacturers disagree.  They read the FDA regulation to require them only to ensure that their labels match the brand-name labels.  See Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et\xc2\xa0al. 38\xe2\x80\x9341.  I need not decide whether the regulation in fact obliges generic manufacturers to approach the FDA to propose a label change.  The majority assumes that it does.  And even if generic manufacturers do not have a duty to propose label changes, two points remain undisputed.  First, they do have a duty under federal law to monitor the safety of their products.  And, second, they may approach the FDA to propose a label change when they believe a change is required.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This brings me to the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emption defense.  State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of dangers to users.  See <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Remington Arms Co.</em>, 94\xe2\x80\x930455, p.\xc2\xa010 (La. 12/8/94), 648 So.\xc2\xa02d 331, 337; <em>Frey</em> v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.</em>, 258 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977).  The Manufacturers contend, and the majority agrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents\xe2\x80\x99 failure-to-warn claims because, under federal law, the Manufac-turers could not have provided additional warnings to respondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.  I cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility \npre-emption.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two principles guide all pre-emption analysis.  First, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1996)).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, . . . we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U. S., at 485; some internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles find particular resonance in these cases.  The States have traditionally regulated health and safety matters.  See <em>id.</em>, at 485.  Notwithstanding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccertain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation\xe2\x80\x9d against drug manufacturers, <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 575, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law tort actions against prescription drug manufacturers, whether brand-name or generic.  To the contrary, when Congress amended the FDCA in 1962 to \xe2\x80\x9cenlarg[e] the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s powers to \xe2\x80\x98protect the public health\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98assure the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,\xe2\x80\x99 [it] took care to preserve state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780); see Pub. L. 87\xe2\x80\x93781, \xc2\xa7202, 76 Stat. 793 (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the amendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be construed as invalidating any provision of State law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments un-\nless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notably, although Congress enacted an express pre-emption provision for medical devices in 1976, see Pub. L. 94\xe2\x80\x93295, \xc2\xa7521, 90 Stat. 574, 21 U.

Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csilence on the issue . . . is powerful evidence that [it] did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 575.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law impliedly pre-empts state law when state and federal law \xe2\x80\x9cconflict\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, when \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law\xe2\x80\x9d or when state law \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crosby</em> v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/363/index.html">530 U.

See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Silkwood</em> v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/238/index.html">464 U. S. 238</a>, 255 (1984).  To prevail on this defense, a defendant must demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance with both federal and state [law] is a physical impossibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.</em> v. <em>Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/index.html">373 U. S. 132</a>, 142\xe2\x80\x93143 (1963); see also <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 573.  In other words, there must be an \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable collision\xe2\x80\x9d between federal and state law.  <em>Florida Lime</em>, 373 U. S., at 143.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption of state law.  <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Norman Williams Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/654/index.html">458 U. S. 654</a>, 659 (1982); see also <em>Gade</em> v. <em>National Solid Wastes Management Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/88/index.html">505 U. S. 88</a>, 110 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In other words, the mere possibility of impossibility is not enough.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Manufacturers contend that it was impossible for them to provide additional warnings to respondents Men-sing and Demahy because federal law prohibited them from changing their labels unilaterally.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  They concede, however, that they could have asked the FDA to initiate a label change.  If the FDA agreed that a label change was required, it could have asked, and indeed pressured, the brand-name manufacturer to change its label, triggering \na corresponding change to the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 generic la-bels.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Thus, had the Manufacturers invoked the available mechanism for initiating label changes, they may well have been able to change their labels in sufficient time to warn respondents.  Having failed to do so, the Manufacturers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without further factual development) to demonstrate that it was impossible for them to comply with both federal and state law.  At most, they have demonstrated only \xe2\x80\x9ca hypothetical or potential conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rice</em>, 458 U. S., at 659.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact that they cannot change their labels unilaterally\xe2\x80\x94which distinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer defendant in <em>Wyeth</em>.  They correctly point out that in <em>Wyeth</em> we concluded that the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s CBE regulation authorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before receiving agency approval of its supplemental application describing the label change.  555 U. S., at 568\xe2\x80\x93571; see also 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6).  But the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s label change was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA retained \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 571.  Thus, in the long run, a brand-name manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with a state-law duty to warn required action by two actors: The brand-name manufacturer had to change the label and the FDA, upon reviewing the supplemental application, had to agree with the change.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The need for FDA approval of the label change did not make compliance with federal and state law impossible in every case.  Instead, because the defendant bore the burden to show impossibility, we required it to produce \xe2\x80\x9cclear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to [the] label.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would apply the same approach in these cases.  State law, respondents allege, required the Manufacturers to provide a strengthened warning about the dangers of \nlong-term metoclopramide use.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Just like the brand-name manufacturer in <em>Wyeth</em>, the Manufacturers had available to them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duty to warn.  Federal law thus \xe2\x80\x9caccommodated\xe2\x80\x9d the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 state-law duties.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa08.  It was not necessarily impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law because, had they approached the FDA, the FDA may well have agreed that a label change was necessary.  Accordingly, as in <em>Wyeth</em>, I would require the Manufacturers to show that the FDA would not have approved a proposed label change.  They have not made such a showing: They do \xe2\x80\x9cnot argue that [they] attempted to give the kind of warning required by [state law] but [were] prohibited from doing so by the FDA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 572.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that generic manufacturers could never show impossibility.  If a generic-manufacturer defendant proposed a label change to the FDA but the FDA rejected the proposal, it would be impossible for that defendant to comply with a state-law duty to warn.  Likewise, impossibility would be established if the FDA had not yet responded to a generic manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s request for a label change at the time a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injuries arose.  A generic manufacturer might also show that the FDA had itself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in light of the evidence on which a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim rests but had decided to leave the warnings as is.  (The Manufacturers make just such an argument in these cases. See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Petitioner Actavis et\xc2\xa0al. 11.)  But these are questions of fact to be established through discovery.  Because the burden of proving impossibility falls on the defendant, I would hold that federal law does not render \nit impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with \na state-law duty to warn as a categorical matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion flows naturally from the overarching prin-ciples governing our pre-emption doctrine.  See <em>supra</em>, \nat 8.  Our \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the States as \xe2\x80\x98independent sovereigns in our federal system\xe2\x80\x99 leads us to assume that \xe2\x80\x98Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 565\xe2\x80\x93566, n.\xc2\xa03 (quoting <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U. S., at 485).  It is for this reason that we hold defendants asserting impossibility to a \xe2\x80\x9cdemanding\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 573.  This presumption against pre-emption has particular force when the Federal Government has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying with state law, even when that mechanism requires federal agency action.  (The presumption has even greater force when federal law requires defendants to invoke that mechanism, as the majority assumes in these cases.)  In such circumstances, I would hold, defendants will usually be unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility if they have not even attempted to employ that mechanism.  Any other approach threatens to infringe the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority over traditional matters of state interest\xe2\x80\x94such as the failure-to-warn claims here\xe2\x80\x94when Congress expressed no intent to pre-empt state law.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority concedes that the Manufacturers might have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  To reach the conclusion that the Manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their bur-den to show impossibility, the majority invents a new pre-emption rule: \xe2\x80\x9cThe question for \xe2\x80\x98impossibility\xe2\x80\x99 is whether the private party could <em>independently</em> do under federal \nlaw what state law requires of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (empha-\nsis added).  Because the Manufacturers could not have changed their labels without the exercise of judgment by the FDA, the majority holds, compliance with both state and federal law was impossible in these cases.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s new test has no basis in our precedents.  The majority cites only <em>Wyeth</em> in support of its test.  As discussed above, however, <em>Wyeth</em> does not stand for the proposition that it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law whenever federal agency approval is required.  To the contrary, label changes by brand-name manufacturers such as Wyeth are subject to FDA review and acceptance.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  And, even if <em>Wyeth</em> could be characterized as turning on the fact that the brand-name manufacturer could change its label unilaterally, the possibility of unilateral action was, at most, a sufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense in that case.  <em>Wyeth</em> did not hold that unilateral action is a necessary condition in every case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With so little support in our case law, the majority un-derstandably turns to other rationales.  None of the \nrationales that it offers, however, makes any sense.  First, it offers a <em>reductio ad absurdum:</em> If the possibility of FDA approval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in these cases, it warns, as a \xe2\x80\x9clogical conclusion\xe2\x80\x9d so too would be the possibility that the FDA might rewrite its regulations or that Congress might amend the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  The logic of this conclusion escapes me.  Conflict analysis necessarily turns on existing law.  It thus would be ridiculous to conclude that federal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the defendant could have asked a federal agency or Congress to change the law.  Here, by contrast, the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their state-law duty to warn did not re-quire them to ask for a change in federal law, as the \nmajority itself recognizes.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal law would permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so\xe2\x80\x9d).  The FDA already afforded them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duties.  Indeed, the majority assumes that FDA regulations <em>required</em> the Manufacturers to request a label change when they had \xe2\x80\x9creasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.57(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority suggests that any other approach would render conflict pre-emption \xe2\x80\x9cillusory\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning-less.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  It expresses concern that, without a robust view of what constitutes conflict, the Supremacy Clause would not have \xe2\x80\x9cany force\xe2\x80\x9d except in cases of express pre-emption.  <em>Ibid.</em>  To the extent the majority\xe2\x80\x99s purported concern is driven by its <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa06, that concern is itself illusory, for the reasons just stated.  To the extent the majority is concerned that our traditionally narrow view of what constitutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption as a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no sense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict pre-emption may be found, even absent impossibility, where state law \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crosby</em>, 530 U. S., at 373 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a>, 886 (2000); <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/25/index.html">517 U.

The majority\xe2\x80\x99s expansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to prevent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory that the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to operate as a so-called <em>non obstante</em> provision.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 225 (2000)).  According to the plurality, <em>non obstante</em> provisions in statutes \xe2\x80\x9cinstruc[t] courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>ante</em>, at 16 (stating that when a statute contains a <em>non obstante</em> provision, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98courts will be less inclined against recognizing repugnancy in applying such statutes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa7147, p. 199 (1891)).  From this understanding of the Supremacy Clause, the plurality extrapolates the principle that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This principle would have been news to the Congress that enacted the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984: Our precedents hold just the opposite.  For more than half a century, we have directed courts to presume that congressional action does <em>not</em> supersede \xe2\x80\x9cthe historic police powers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/index.html">331 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (1947); see also <em>Gade</em>, 505 U. S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  We apply this presumption against pre-emption both where Congress has spoken to the pre-emption question and where it has not.  See <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 566, n.\xc2\xa03.  In the context of express pre-emption, we read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre-empt state law.  See <em>Altria Group, Inc.</em> v. <em>Good</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/70/index.html">555 U. S. 70</a>, 77 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause \nis susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \xe2\x80\x98accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Bates</em> v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/431/index.html">544 U. S. 431</a>, 449 (2005))); see also <em>Cipollone</em> v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U. S. 504</a>, 518 (1992).  And, when the claim is that federal law impliedly pre-empts state law, we require a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d showing of a conflict \xe2\x80\x9cto overcome the presumption that state and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist with federal regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hillsborough County</em> v. <em>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/index.html">471 U. S. 707</a>, 716 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s new theory of the Supremacy Clause is a direct assault on these precedents.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Whereas we have long presumed that federal law does not pre-empt, or repeal, state law, the plurality today reads the Supremacy Clause to operate as a provision instructing courts \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not</em> to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  And whereas we have long required evidence of a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and manifest\xe2\x80\x9d purpose to pre-empt, <em>Rice</em>, 331 U. S., at 230, the plurality now instructs courts to \xe2\x80\x9clook no further than the ordinary meaning of federal law\xe2\x80\x9d before concluding that Congress must have intended to cast aside state law, <em>ante</em>, at 16 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this novel theory of the Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x94a theory advocated by no party or <em>amici</em> in these cases\xe2\x80\x94is telling.  Proper application of the longstanding presumption <em>against</em> pre-emption compels the conclusion that federal law does not render compliance with state law impossible merely because it requires an actor to seek federal agency approval.  When federal law provides actors with a mech-anism for attempting to comply with their state-law \nduties, \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the States as \xe2\x80\x98independent sovereigns in our federal system\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d should require those actors to attempt to comply with state law before being heard to complain that compliance with both laws was impossible.  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 565\xe2\x80\x93566, n.\xc2\xa03 (quoting <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U. S., at 485).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision leads to so many absurd consequences that I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended to pre-empt state law in these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption analysis strips generic-drug consumers of compensation when they are injured by inadequate warnings.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress had intended to deprive injured parties of [this] long available form of compensation, it surely would have expressed that intent more clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bates</em>, 544 U. S., at 449.  Given the longstanding existence of product liability actions, including for failure to warn, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Silkwood</em>, 464 U. S., at 251; see also <em>Bruesewitz</em> v. <em>Wyeth LLC</em>, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (noting our previously expressed \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt that Congress would quietly preempt product-liability claims without providing a federal substitute\xe2\x80\x9d).  In concluding that Congress silently immunized generic manufacturers from all failure-to-warn claims, the majority disregards our previous hesitance to infer congressional intent to effect such a sweeping change in traditional state-law remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority itself admits, a drug consumer\xe2\x80\x99s right \nto compensation for inadequate warnings now turns on \nthe happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her pre-scription with a brand-name drug or a generic.  If a consumer takes a brand-name drug, she can sue the manufacturer for inadequate warnings under our opinion in <em>Wyeth</em>.  If, however, she takes a generic drug, as occurs 75 percent of the time, she now has no right to sue.  The majority offers no reason to think\xe2\x80\x94apart from its new articulation of the impossibility standard\xe2\x80\x94that Congress would have intended such an arbitrary distinction.  In some States, pharmacists must dispense generic drugs absent instruction to the contrary from a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s physician.  Even when consumers can request brand-name drugs, the price of the brand-name drug or the consumers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance plans may make it impossible to do so.  As a result, in many cases, consumers will have no ability to preserve their state-law right to recover for injuries caused by inadequate warnings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision creates a gap in the parallel federal-state regulatory scheme in a way that could have troubling consequences for drug safety.  As we explained in <em>Wyeth</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly.\xe2\x80\x9d  555 U. S., at 579.  Thus, we recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cstate law offers an additional, and important, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision eliminates the traditional state-law incentives for generic manufacturers to monitor and disclose safety risks.  When a generic drug has a brand-name equivalent on the market, the brand-name manufacturer will remain incentivized to uncover safety risks.  But brand-name manufacturers often leave the market once generic versions are available, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, meaning that there will be no manufacturer subject to failure-to-warn liability.  As to those generic drugs, there will be no \xe2\x80\x9cadditional . . . layer of consumer protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 579.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision undoes the core principle of \nthe Hatch-Waxman Amendments that generic and brand-name drugs are the \xe2\x80\x9csame\xe2\x80\x9d in nearly all respects.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  See Brief for Rep. Henry A. Waxman as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9.  \nThe majority pins the expansion of the generic drug market on \xe2\x80\x9cthe special, and different, regulation of generic drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d which allows generic manufacturers to produce their drugs more cheaply.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  This tells only half the story.  The expansion of the market for generic drugs has also flowed from the increased acceptance of, and trust in, generic drugs by consumers, physicians, and state legislators alike.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision introduces a critical distinction between brand-name and generic drugs.  Consumers of brand-name drugs can sue manufacturers for inadequate warnings; consumers of generic drugs cannot.  These divergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer demand for generics, at least among consumers who can afford brand-name drugs.  They may pose \xe2\x80\x9can ethical dilemma\xe2\x80\x9d for prescribing physicians.  Brief for American Medical Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 29.  And they may well cause the States to rethink their longstanding efforts to promote generic use through generic substitution laws.  See Brief for National Conference of State Legislators as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15 (state generic substitution laws \xe2\x80\x9chave proceeded on the premise that . . . generic drugs are not, from citizens\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, materially different from brand ones, except for the lower price\xe2\x80\x9d).  These consequences are directly at odds with the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 goal of increasing consumption of generic drugs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion convinces me that, in enacting the requirement that generic labels match their corresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended these absurd results.  The Court certainly has not shown that such was the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>clear and manifest</em> purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em>, 555 U. S., at 565 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  To the contrary, because federal law affords generic manufacturers a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn, I would hold that federal law does not categorically \npre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic manufacturers.  Especially in light of the presumption against pre-emption, the burden should fall on generic manufacturers to show that compliance was impossible on the particular facts of their case.  By holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of <em>possibility</em>\xe2\x80\x9d is insufficient to \xe2\x80\x9cdefea[t]\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption in these cases, <em>ante</em>, at 18, n.\xc2\xa08, the Court contorts our pre-emption doctrine and exempts defendants from their burden to establish impossibility.
