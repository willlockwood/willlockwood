If it works in tandem with other provisions, it must be assessed in concert with those provisions.  Section 284, the Patent Act\xe2\x80\x99s general damages provision, states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement.\xe2\x80\x9d  The focus of that provision is \xe2\x80\x9cthe infringement.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9coverriding purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7284 is to \xe2\x80\x9caffor[d] patent owners complete compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for infringements.  <i>General Motors Corp.</i> v. <i>Devex Corp.</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648, 655.  Section 271 identifies several ways that a patent can be infringed.  Thus, to determine \xc2\xa7284\xe2\x80\x99s focus in a given case, the type of infringement that occurred must be identified.  Here, \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) was the basis for WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim and the lost-profits damages that it received.  That provision regulates the domestic act of \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[ying] in or from the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and this Court has acknowledged that it vindicates domestic interests, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Microsoft Corp. </i>v. <i>AT&amp;T Corp., </i>\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 457.  In sum, the focus of \xc2\xa7284 in a case involving infringement under \xc2\xa7271(f)(2) is on the act of exporting components from the United States.

The damages themselves are merely the means by which the statute achieves its end of remedying infringements, and the overseas events giving rise to the lost-profit damages here were merely incidental to the infringement.  In asserting that damages awards for foreign injuries are always an extraterritorial application of a damages provision, ION misreads a portion of <i>RJR Nabisco</i> that interpreted a substantive element of a cause of action, not a remedial damages provision.

This principle, commonly called the presumption against extraterritoriality, has deep roots.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts \xc2\xa743, p. 268 (2012) (tracing it to the medieval maxim <i>Statuta suo clauduntur territorio, nec ultra territorium disponunt</i>); <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Palmer</i>, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[G]eneral words must .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be limited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state\xe2\x80\x9d).

It can be rebutted only if the text provides a \xe2\x80\x9cclear indication of an extraterritorial application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison </i>v. <i>National Australia</i> <i>Bank Ltd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247, 255 (2010).  If the presumption against extraterritoriality has not been rebutted, the second step of our framework asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the case involves a domestic application of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>RJR Nabisco</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Courts make this determination by identifying \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98focus\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and asking whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred in United States territory.  <i>Ibid.</i>  If it did, then the case involves a permissible domestic application of the statute.  See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We resolve this case at step two.  While \xe2\x80\x9cit will usually be preferable\xe2\x80\x9d to begin with step one, courts have the discretion to begin at step two \xe2\x80\x9cin appropriate cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>id.,</i> at ___, n.\xc2\xa05 (slip op., at 10, n.\xc2\xa05) (citing <i>Pearson </i>v. <i>Callahan</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, 236\xe2\x80\x93243 (2009)).  One reason to exercise that discretion is if addressing step one would require resolving \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult questions\xe2\x80\x9d that do not change \xe2\x80\x9cthe outcome of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d but could have far-reaching effects in future cases.  See <i>id.,</i> at 236\xe2\x80\x93237.  That is true here.  WesternGeco argues that the presumption against extraterritoriality should never apply to statutes, such as \xc2\xa7284, that merely provide a general damages remedy for conduct that Congress has declared unlawful.  Resolving that question could implicate many other statutes besides the Patent Act.  We therefore exercise our discretion to forgo the first step of our extraterritoriality framework.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under the second step of our framework, we must identify \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98focus.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>RJR Nabisco</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).

Otherwise, it would be impossible to accurately determine whether the application of the statute in the case is a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>RJR Nabisco</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  And determining how the statute has actually been applied is the whole point of the focus test.  See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying these principles here, we conclude that the conduct relevant to the statutory focus in this case is domestic.  We begin with \xc2\xa7284.  It provides a general damages remedy for the various types of patent infringement identified in the Patent Act.  The portion of \xc2\xa7284 at issue here states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe infringement\xe2\x80\x9d is the focus of this statute.  As this Court has explained, the \xe2\x80\x9coverriding purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa7284 is to \xe2\x80\x9caffor[d] patent owners complete compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for infringements.  <i>General Motors Corp. </i>v. <i>Devex Corp.,</i>\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648, 655 (1983).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe question\xe2\x80\x9d posed by the statute is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98how much ha[s] the Patent Holder .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. suffered by the infringement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Aro Mfg.

Accordingly, the infringement is plainly the focus of \xc2\xa7284.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that observation does not fully resolve this case, as the Patent Act identifies several ways that a patent can be infringed.  See \xc2\xa7271.  To determine the focus of \xc2\xa7284 in a given case, we must look to the type of infringement that occurred.  We thus turn to \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2), which was the basis for WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim and the lost-profits damages that it received.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) focuses on domestic conduct.  It provides that a company \xe2\x80\x9cshall be liable as an infringer\xe2\x80\x9d if it \xe2\x80\x9csupplies\xe2\x80\x9d certain components of a patented invention \xe2\x80\x9cin or from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d with the intent that they \xe2\x80\x9cwill be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  The conduct that \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) regulates\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>its focus\xe2\x80\x94is the domestic act of \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[ying] in or from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  As this Court has acknowledged, \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0) vindicates domestic interests: It \xe2\x80\x9cwas a direct response to a gap in our patent law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Microsoft Corp.</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 457, and \xe2\x80\x9creach[es] components that are manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Life Technologies</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  As the Federal Circuit explained, \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) protects against \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic entities who export components .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  791 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1351.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, the focus of \xc2\xa7284, in a case involving infringement under \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2), is on the act of exporting components from the United States.  In other words, the domestic infringement is \xe2\x80\x9cthe objec[t] of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d in this context.  <i>Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267.  The conduct in this case that is relevant to that focus clearly occurred in the United States, as it was ION\xe2\x80\x99s domestic act of supplying the components that infringed WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s pat- ents.  Thus, the lost-profits damages that were awarded to WesternGeco were a domestic application of \xc2\xa7284.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">ION\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.  ION contends that the statutory focus here is \xe2\x80\x9cself-evidently on the award of damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 22.  While \xc2\xa7284 does authorize damages, what a statute authorizes is not necessarily its focus.  Rather, the focus is \xe2\x80\x9cthe objec[t] of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which can turn on the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cparties,\xe2\x80\x9d or interests that it regulates or protects.  <i>Morrison</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 267.  Here, the damages themselves are merely the means by which the statute achieves its end of remedying infringements.  Similarly, ION is mistaken to assert that this case involves an extraterritorial application of \xc2\xa7284 simply because \xe2\x80\x9clost-profits damages occurred extraterritorially, and foreign conduct subsequent to [ION\xe2\x80\x99s] infringement was necessary to give rise to the injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 22.  Those overseas events were merely incidental to the infringement.  In other words, they do not have \xe2\x80\x9cprimacy\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the extraterritoriality analysis.  <i>Morrison</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 267.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">ION also draws on the conclusion in <i>RJR Nabisco</i> that \xe2\x80\x9cRICO damages claims\xe2\x80\x9d based \xe2\x80\x9centirely on injury suffered abroad\xe2\x80\x9d involve an extraterritorial application of\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71964(c).  579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).  From this principle, ION extrapolates a general rule that damages awards for foreign injuries are always an extraterritorial application of a damages provision.  This argument misreads <i>RJR Nabisco</i>.  That portion of <i>RJR Nabisco</i> interpreted a substantive element of a cause of action, not a remedial damages provision.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 18).  It explained that a plaintiff could not bring a damages claim under \xc2\xa71964(c) unless he could prove that he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98injured in his business or property,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which required proof of \xe2\x80\x9ca <i>domestic</i> injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Thus, <i>RJR Nabisco</i> was applying the presumption against extraterritoriality to interpret the scope of \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s injury requirement; it did not make any statements about damages\xe2\x80\x94a separate legal concept.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two of our colleagues contend that the Patent Act does not permit damages awards for lost foreign profits.  <i>Post</i>, at 1 (Gorsuch, J., joined by Breyer, J., dissenting).  Their position wrongly conflates legal injury with the damages arising from that injury.  See <i>post</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.

Taken together, \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) and \xc2\xa7284 allow the patent owner to recover for lost foreign profits.  Under \xc2\xa7284, damages are \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d to compensate for infringement when they \xe2\x80\x9cplac[e] [the patent owner] in as good a position as he would have been in\xe2\x80\x9d if the patent had not been infringed.  <i>General Motors Corp., supra</i>, at 655.

With that much, I agree.  But I cannot subscribe to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s further holding that the terms of the Patent Act permit awards of this kind.  In my view the Act\xe2\x80\x99s terms prohibit the lost profits sought in this case, whatever the general presumption against extraterritoriality applicable to all statutes might allow.  So while the Federal Circuit may have relied in part on a mistaken extraterritoriality analysis, I respectfully submit it reached the right result in concluding that the Patent Act forecloses WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s claim for lost profits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The reason is straightforward.  A U.\xc2\xa0S. patent provides a lawful monopoly over the manufacture, use, and sale of an invention within this country only.  Meanwhile, WesternGeco seeks lost profits for uses of its invention beyond our borders.  Specifically, the company complains that it lost lucrative foreign surveying contracts because ION\xe2\x80\x99s customers used its invention overseas to steal that business.  In measuring its damages, WesternGeco assumes it could have charged monopoly rents abroad premised on a U.\xc2\xa0S. patent that has no legal force there.  Permitting damages of this sort would effectively allow U.\xc2\xa0S. patent owners to use American courts to extend their monopolies to foreign markets.  That, in turn, would invite other countries to use their own patent laws and courts to assert control over our economy.  Nothing in the terms of the Patent Act supports that result and much militates against it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with the key statutory language.  Under the Patent Act, a patent owner enjoys \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention <i>throughout the United States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7154(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Emphasizing the point, the Act proceeds to explain that to \xe2\x80\x9cinfring[e] the patent\xe2\x80\x9d someone must \xe2\x80\x9cwithout authority mak[e], us[e], offe[r] to sell, or sel[l] [the] patented invention, <i>within the United States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(a) (emphasis added).  So making, using, or selling a patented invention <i>inside</i> the United States invites a claim for infringement.  But those same acts <i>outside</i> the United States do not infringe a U.\xc2\xa0S. patent right.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These principles work their way into the statutory measure of damages too.  A patent owner who proves infringement is entitled to receive \xe2\x80\x9cdamages adequate to compensate <i>for the infringement</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7284 (emphasis added).  Because an infringement must occur within the United States, that means a plaintiff can recover damages for the making, using, or selling of its invention within the United States, but not for the making, using, or selling of its invention elsewhere.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What\xe2\x80\x99s the upshot for our case?  The jury was free to award WesternGeco royalties for the infringing products ION produced in this country; indeed, ION has not challenged that award either here or before the Federal Circuit.  If ION\xe2\x80\x99s infringement had cost WesternGeco sales in this country, it could have recovered for that harm too.  At the same time, WesternGeco is not entitled to lost profits caused by the use of its invention <i>outside</i> the United States.  That foreign conduct isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cinfringement\xe2\x80\x9d and so under \xc2\xa7284\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms isn\xe2\x80\x99t a proper basis for awarding \xe2\x80\x9ccompensat[ion].\xe2\x80\x9d  No doubt WesternGeco thinks it unfair that its invention was used to compete against it overseas.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the kind of harm for which our patent laws provide compensation because a U.\xc2\xa0S. patent does not protect its owner from competition beyond our borders.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents confirm what the statutory text indicates.  In <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Duchesne</i>, 19 How. 183 (1857), the Court considered whether the use of an American invention on the high seas could support a damages claim under the U.\xc2\xa0S. patent laws.  It said no.  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of [an invention] outside of the jurisdiction of the United States is not an infringement of [the patent owner\xe2\x80\x99s] rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and so the patent owner \xe2\x80\x9chas no claim to any compensation for\xe2\x80\x9d that foreign use.  <i>Id.,</i> at 195\xe2\x80\x93196.  A defendant must \xe2\x80\x9ccompensate the patentee,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court continued, only to the extent that it has \xe2\x80\x9ccom[e] in competition with the [patent owner] where the [patent owner] was entitled to the exclusive use\xe2\x80\x9d of his invention\xe2\x80\x94namely<i>, </i>within the United States.  <i>Id.,</i> at 196.  What held true there must hold true here.  ION must compensate WesternGeco for its intrusion on WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right to make, use, and sell its invention in the United States.  But WesternGeco \xe2\x80\x9chas no claim to any compensation for\xe2\x80\x9d noninfringing uses of its invention \xe2\x80\x9coutside of the jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 195\xe2\x80\x93196.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other precedents offer similar teachings.  In <i>Birdsall</i> v. <i>Coolidge</i>,\n\n93 U.\xc2\xa0S. 64 (1876), the Court explained that damages are supposed to compensate a patent owner for \xe2\x80\x9cthe unlawful acts of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  To that end, the Court held, damages \xe2\x80\x9cshall be <i>precisely commensurate </i>with the injury suffered, neither more nor less.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  It\xe2\x80\x99s undisputed that the only injury WesternGeco suffered here came from ION\xe2\x80\x99s infringing activity within the United States.  A damages award that sweeps much more broadly to cover third parties\xe2\x80\x99 noninfringing foreign uses can hardly be called \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely commensurate\xe2\x80\x9d with that injury.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s leading case on lost profit damages points the same way.  In <i>Yale Lock Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Sargent</i>,\n\n117 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536 (1886), the patent owner \xe2\x80\x9cavailed himself of his exclusive right by keeping his patent a monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d and selling the invention himself.  <i>Id.</i>, at 552.  As damages for a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s infringement of the patent, the patent owner could recover \xe2\x80\x9cthe difference between his pecuniary condition after the infringement, and what his condition would have been if the infringement had not occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And that difference, the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cis to be measured\xe2\x80\x9d by the additional profits the patent owner \xe2\x80\x9cwould have realized from such sales if the infringement had not interfered with such monopoly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 552\xe2\x80\x93553.  So, again, the Court tied the measure of damages to the degree of interference with the patent owner\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right to make, use, and sell its invention.  And, again, that much is missing here because foreign uses of WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s invention could not have interfered with its U.\xc2\xa0S. patent monopoly.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">You might wonder whether \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) calls for a special exception to these general principles.  WesternGeco certainly thinks it does.  It\xe2\x80\x99s true, too, that \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) expressly refers to foreign conduct.  The statute says that some- one who exports a specialized component, \xe2\x80\x9cintending that [it] will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\xe2\x80\x9d  From this language, you might wonder whether \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) seeks to protect patent owners from the foreign conduct that occurred in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It does not.  Section 271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) modifies the circumstances when the law will treat an invention as having been made within the United States.  It permits an infringement claim\xe2\x80\x94and the damages that come with it\xe2\x80\x94not only when someone produces the complete invention in this country for export, but also when someone exports key components of the invention for assembly aboard.  A person who ships components from the United States intending they be assembled across the border is \xe2\x80\x9cliable\xe2\x80\x9d to the patent owner for royalties and lost profits the same as if he made the entire invention here.  \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2).  But none of this changes the bedrock rule that <i>foreign</i> <i>uses</i> of an invention (even an invention made in this country) do not infringe a U.\xc2\xa0S. patent.  Nor could it.  For after \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, as before, patent rights exclude others from making, using, and selling an invention only \xe2\x80\x9cthroughout the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7154(a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The history of the statute underscores the point.  In <i>Deepsouth Packing Co.</i> v. <i>Laitram Corp.</i>,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518 (1972), the Court held that a defendant did not \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d an invention within the United States when it produced the invention\xe2\x80\x99s components here but sold them to foreign buyers for final assembly abroad.  <i>Id.,</i> at 527\xe2\x80\x93528.  The Court recognized that, if the defendant had assembled the parts in this country and then sold them to the foreign buyers, it would have unlawfully made and sold the invention within the United States.  <i>Id.</i>, at 527.  But because what it made and sold in this country \xe2\x80\x9cfell short\xe2\x80\x9d of the complete invention, the Court held, the patent laws did not prohibit its conduct.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The dissent, by contrast, argued that for all practical purposes the invention \xe2\x80\x9cwas <i>made</i> in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9ceverything was accomplished in this country except putting the pieces together.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 533 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  Apparently Congress agreed, for it then added \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) and made clear that someone who <i>almost makes </i>an invention in this country may be held liable as if he made the complete invention in this country.  As the Solicitor General has explained, the new statute \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively treat[ed] the <i>domestic supply</i> of the components of a patented invention for assembly abroad as tantamount to the <i>domestic manufacture</i> of the completed invention for export.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 22 (emphasis added).  Section 271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) thus expands what qualifies as <i>making an invention in this country</i> but does nothing to suggest that U.\xc2\xa0S. patents protect against\xe2\x80\x94much less guarantee compensation for\xe2\x80\x94<i>uses abroad</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any suggestion that \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) provides protection against foreign uses would also invite anomalous results.  It would allow greater recovery when a defendant exports a <i>component</i> of an invention in violation of \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) than when a defendant exports the<i> entire </i>invention in violation of \xc2\xa7271(a).  And it would threaten to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conver[t] a single act of supply from the United States into a springboard for liability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Microsoft Corp.</i> v. <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437, 456 (2007).  Here, for example, supplying a single infringing product from the United States would make ION responsible for any foreseeable harm its customers cause by using the product to compete against WesternGeco worldwide, even though WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s U.\xc2\xa0S. patent doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect it from such competition.  It\xe2\x80\x99s some springboard, too.  The harm flowing from foreign uses in this case appears to outstrip wildly the harm inflicted by ION\xe2\x80\x99s domestic production: the jury awarded $93.4 million in lost profits from uses in 10 foreign surveys but only $12.5 million in royalties for 2,500 U.\xc2\xa0S.-made products.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even more dramatic examples are not hard to imagine.  Suppose a company develops a prototype microchip in a U.\xc2\xa0S. lab with the intention of manufacturing and selling the chip in a foreign country as part of a new smartphone.  Suppose too that the chip infringes a U.\xc2\xa0S. patent and that the patent owner sells its own phone with its own chip overseas.  Under the terms of the Patent Act, the developer commits an act of infringement by creating the proto- type here, but the additional chips it makes and sells outside the United States do not qualify as infringement.  Under WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s approach, however, the patent owner could recover any profits it lost to that foreign competition\xe2\x80\x94or even three times as much, see \xc2\xa7284\xe2\x80\x94effectively giving the patent owner a monopoly over foreign markets through its U.\xc2\xa0S. patent.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a very odd role for U.\xc2\xa0S. patent law to play in foreign markets, as \xe2\x80\x9cforeign law alone, not United States law,\xe2\x80\x9d is supposed to govern the manufacture, use, and sale \xe2\x80\x9cof patented inventions in foreign countries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Microsoft</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 456.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worse yet, the tables easily could be turned.  If our courts award compensation to U.\xc2\xa0S. patent owners for foreign uses where our patents don\xe2\x80\x99t run, what happens when foreign courts return the favor?  Suppose our hypothetical microchip developer infringed a foreign patent in the course of developing its new chip abroad, but then mass produced and sold the chip in the United States.  A foreign court might reasonably hold the U.\xc2\xa0S. company liable for infringing the foreign patent in the foreign country.  But if it followed WesternGeco\xe2\x80\x99s theory, the court might then award monopoly rent damages reflecting a right to control the market for the chip in <i>this </i>country\xe2\x80\x94even though the foreign patent lacks any legal force here.  It is doubtful Congress would accept that kind of foreign \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol over our markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Deepsouth</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 531.  And principles of comity counsel against an interpretation of our patent laws that would interfere so dramatically with the rights of other nations to regulate their own economies.  While Congress may seek to extend U.\xc2\xa0S. patent rights beyond our borders if it chooses, cf. \xc2\xa7105 (addressing inventions made, used, and sold in outer space), nothing in the Patent Act fairly suggests that it has taken that step here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision unfortunately forecloses further consideration of these points.  Although its opinion focuses almost entirely on why the presumption against extraterritoriality applicable to all statutes does not forbid the damages sought here, the Court asserts in a few cursory sentences that the Patent Act by its terms allows recovery for foreign uses in cases like this.  See <i>ante,</i> at 9.  In doing so, the Court does not address the textual or doctrinal analysis offered here.  It does not explain why \xe2\x80\x9cdamages adequate to compensate <i>for the infringement</i>\xe2\x80\x9d should include damages for harm from <i>noninfringing</i> uses.  \xc2\xa7284 (emphasis added).  It does not try to reconcile its holding with the teachings of <i>Duchesne</i>,<i> Birdsall</i>, and <i>Yale Lock</i>.  And it ignores <i>Microsoft</i>\xe2\x80\x99s admonition that \xc2\xa7271(f\xc2\xa0)(2) should not be read to create springboards for liability based on foreign conduct.  Instead, the Court relies on two cases that do not come close to supporting its broad holding.  In <i>General Motors Corp.</i> v. <i>Devex Corp.</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648 (1983), the Court held that prejudgment interest should normally be awarded so as to place the patent owner \xe2\x80\x9cin as good a position as [it] would have been in had the in- fringer\xe2\x80\x9d not infringed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 655.  Allowing recovery for for- eign uses, however, puts the patent owner in a <i>better</i> position than it was before by allowing it to demand monopoly rents outside the United States as well as within.  In <i>Aro Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Convertible Top Replacement Co.</i>,\n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476 (1964), meanwhile, the Court simply applied <i>Yale Lock</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rule that a patent owner may recover \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the difference between his pecuniary condition after the infringement, and what his condition would have been if the infringement had not occurred.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 507 (quoting <i>Yale Lock</i>, 117 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 552).  As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, that test seeks to measure the interference with the patent owner\xe2\x80\x99s lawful monopoly over <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. </i>markets alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By failing to heed the plain text of the Patent Act and the lessons of our precedents, the Court ends up assuming that patent damages run (literally) to the ends of the earth.  It allows U.\xc2\xa0S. patent owners to extend their patent monopolies far beyond anything Congress has authorized and shields them from foreign competition U.\xc2\xa0S. patents were never meant to reach.  Because I cannot agree that the Patent Act requires that result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General disputes this reading of <i>Duchesne</i>.  In his view, the Court indicated that, if a defendant \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted domestic infringement\xe2\x80\x9d by making the invention in the United States, the patent owner would have been entitled to recover for any subsequent use of the invention, including \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the use of this improvement .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the high seas.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 17 (quoting <i>Duchesne</i>, 19 How., at 196).  I am unpersuaded.  The Court proceeded to explain that the \xe2\x80\x9conly use\xe2\x80\x9d of the invention that might require compensation was \xe2\x80\x9cin navigating the vessel into and out of [Boston] harbor, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>while she was within the jurisdiction of the United States</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 196 (emphasis added).

It merely observed, in passing, that the only markets for the invention at issue were \xe2\x80\x9cthe oil-producing regions of Pennsylvania and Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 256.
