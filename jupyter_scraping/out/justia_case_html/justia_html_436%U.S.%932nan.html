App. to Pet. for Cert. A. 18-A. 20. </p><p> As the text of Birmingham\'s ordinances suggest, Birmingham has attempted to declare obscene all material that it could constitutionally declare obscene under this Court\'s guidelines in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U.S. 15</a> (1973). See 353 So.2d 528, 533 ( Ala.Crim.App.), cert. denied, 353 So.2d 534 (Ala.1977). Birmingham has, moreover, allowed warrants to issue for the seizure of allegedly obscene motion pictures on a showing of probable cause to believe a film is obscene under the Miller standards. </p><p> In this Court and in the courts below, petitioner has contended that Ordinance No. 74-18 is unconstitutional because it allows a warrant to issue under the authority of a judicial officer who has not personally seen the allegedly obscene motion picture. This argument is not insubstantial, but I need not address it since I continue to adhere to my view that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="935">Page 436 U.S. 932 , 935</a></p><p> "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly \'obscene\' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/49/case.html#113">413 U.S. 49, 113</a> (1973) (dissenting opinion). Under this test, Birmingham Ordinance No. 67-2 is unconstitutionally overbroad and invalid on its face. See Miller v. California, supra, 413 U.S. at 47 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Similarly, Birmingham Ordinance No. 74-18 is also invalid in that it allows the seizure of a film on a showing that cannot, under my view of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, constitute probable cause to believe a crime has been committed. For these reasons, I would grant certiorari and summarily reverse petitioner\'s convictions.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
