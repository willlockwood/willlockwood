We disagree with the view taken by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1976, the United States brought an antitrust action against petitioners, owners of various department stores, alleging that they had violated \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1, by agreeing to fix the retail price of women\'s clothing sold in northern California.  Seven parallel civil actions were subsequently filed by private plaintiffs seeking treble damages on behalf of proposed classes of retail purchasers, including that of respondent Moitie in state court (<em>Moitie I</em>) and respondent Brown (<em>Brown I</em>) in the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 452 U. S. 396</a></p><p> States District Court for the Northern District of California.  Each of these complaints tracked almost verbatim the allegations of the Government\'s complaint, though the <em>Moitie I</em> complaint referred solely to state law.  All of the actions originally filed in the District Court were assigned to a single federal judge, and the <em>Moitie I</em> case was removed there on the basis of diversity of citizenship and federal question jurisdiction.  The District Court dismissed all of the actions "in their entirety" on the ground that plaintiffs had not alleged an "injury" to their "business or property" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15.  <em>Weinberg v. Federated Department Stores,</em> 426 F.Supp. 880 (1977).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs in five of the suits appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The single counsel representing Moitie and Brown, however, chose not to appeal, and instead refiled the two actions in state court, <em>Moitie II</em> and <em>Brown II.</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Although the complaints purported to raise only state law claims, they made allegations similar to those made in the prior complaints, including that of the Government.  Petitioners removed these new actions to the District Court for the Northern District of California and moved to have them dismissed on the ground of <em>res judicata.</em>  In a decision rendered July 8, 1977, the District Court first denied respondents\' motion to remand.  It held that the complaints, though artfully couched in terms of state law, were "in many respects identical" with the prior complaints, and were thus properly removed to federal court because they raised "essentially federal law" claims.  The court then concluded that, because <em>Moitie II</em> and <em>Brown II</em> involved the "same parties, the same alleged offenses, and the same time periods" as <em>Moitie I</em> and <em>Brown I,</em> the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 452 U. S. 397</a></p><p> required that they be dismissed.  This time, Moitie and Brown appealed.</p>\n<p>Pending that appeal, this Court, on June 11, 1979, decided <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html">442 U. S. 330</a></span>, holding that retail purchasers can suffer an "injury" to their "business or property" as those terms are used in \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  On June 25, 1979, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the five cases which had been decided with <em>Moitie I</em> and <em>Brown I,</em> the cases that had been appealed, for further proceedings in light of <em>Reiter.</em></p>\n<p>When <em>Moitie II</em> and <em>Brown II</em> finally came before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court reversed the decision of the District Court dismissing the cases.  611 F.2d 1267. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Though the court recognized that a "strict application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> would preclude our review of the instant decision," <em>id.</em> at 1269, it refused to apply the doctrine to the facts of this case.  It observed that the other five litigants in the <em>Weinberg</em> cases had successfully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 452 U. S. 398</a></p><p> appealed the decision against them.  It then asserted that "nonappealing parties may benefit from a reversal when their position is closely interwoven with that of appealing parties," <em>ibid.,</em> and concluded that, "[b]ecause the instant dismissal rested on a case that has been effectively overruled," the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> must give way to "public policy" and "simple justice."  <em>Id.</em> at 1269-1270.  We granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 991 (1980), to consider the validity of the Court of Appeals\' novel exception to the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is little to be added to the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> as developed in the case law of this Court.  A final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.  <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/591/case.html">333 U.

S. 201</a></span> (1932).</p>\n<p>In this case, the Court of Appeals conceded that the "strict application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>" required that <em>Brown II</em> be dismissed.  By that, the court presumably meant that the "technical elements" of <em>res judicata</em> had been satisfied, namely, that the decision in <em>Brown I</em> was a final judgment on the merits and involved the same claims and the same parties as <em>Brown II.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The court, however, declined to dismiss <em>Brown II</em> because, in its view, it would be unfair to bar respondents from relitigating a claim so "closely interwoven" with that of the successfully appealing parties.  We believe that such an unprecedented departure from accepted principles of <em>res judicata</em> is unwarranted.  Indeed, the decision below is all but foreclosed by our prior case law. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Reed v. Allen, supra,</em> this Court addressed the issue presented here.  The case involved a dispute over the rights to property left in a will.  <em>A</em> won an interpleader action for rents derived from the property and, while an appeal was pending, brought an ejectment action against the rival claimant <em>B.</em>  On </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 452 U. S. 400</a></p><p> the basis of the decree in the interpleader suit, <em>A</em> won the ejectment action.  <em>B</em> did not appeal this judgment, but prevailed on his earlier appeal from the interpleader decree and was awarded the rents which had been collected.  When <em>B</em> sought to bring an ejectment action against <em>A,</em> the latter pleaded <em>res judicata,</em> based on his previous successful ejectment action.  This Court held that <em>res judicata</em> was available as a defense, and that the property belonged to <em>A:</em></p>\n<p>"The judgment in the ejectment action was final, and not open to assault collaterally, but subject to impeachment only through some form of direct attack.  The appellate court was limited to a review of the interpleader decree, and it is hardly necessary to say that jurisdiction to review one judgment gives an appellate court no power to reverse or modify another and independent judgment.  If respondent, in addition to appealing from the [interpleader] decree, had appealed from the [ejectment] judgment, the appellate court, having both cases before it, might have afforded a remedy. . . .  But this course respondent neglected to follow."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/191/case.html#198">286 U. S. 198</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This Court\'s rigorous application of <em>res judicata</em> in <em>Reed,</em> to the point of leaving one party in possession and the other party entitled to the rents, makes clear that this Court recognizes no general equitable doctrine, such as that suggested by the Court of Appeals, which countenances an exception to the finality of a party\'s failure to appeal merely because his rights are "closely interwoven" with those of another party.  Indeed, this case presents even more compelling reasons to apply the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> than did <em>Reed.</em>  Respondents here seek to be the windfall beneficiaries of an appellate reversal procured by other independent parties, who have no interest in respondents\' case, not a reversal in interrelated cases procured, as in <em>Reed,</em> by the same affected party.  Moreover, in contrast to <em>Reed,</em> where it was unclear why no appeal was taken, it is apparent that respondents here made a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 452 U. S. 401</a></p><p> calculated choice to forgo their appeals.  <em>See also Ackermann v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/193/case.html">340 U.

S. 198</a></span> (1950) (holding that petitioners were not entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) when they made a "free, calculated, deliberate choic[e]" not to appeal).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also rested its opinion in part on what it viewed as "simple justice."  But we do not see the grave injustice which would be done by the application of accepted principles of <em>res judicata.</em>  "Simple justice" is achieved when a complex body of law developed over a period of years is evenhandedly applied.  The doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> serves vital public interests beyond any individual judge\'s <em>ad hoc</em> determination of the equities in a particular case.  There is simply "no principle of law or equity which sanctions the rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of <em>res judicata.</em>"  <em>Heiser v. Woodruf,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/726/case.html">327 U.

The Court of Appeals\' reliance on "public policy" is similarly misplaced.  This Court has long recognized that</p>\n<p>"[p]ublic policy dictates that there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled as between the parties."</p>\n<p><em>Baldwin v.

We have stressed that</p>\n<p>"[the] doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> is not a mere matter of practice or procedure inherited from a more technical time than ours.  It is a rule of fundamental and substantial justice, \'of public policy and of private peace,\' which should be cordially regarded and enforced by the courts. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Hart Steel Co. v.

The language used by this Court half a century ago is even more compelling in view of today\'s crowded dockets:</p>\n<p>"The predicament in which respondent finds himself is of his own making. . . .  [W]e cannot be expected, for his sole relief, to upset the general and well established doctrine of <em>res judicata,</em> conceived in the light of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 452 U.

And the mischief which would follow the establishment of precedent for so disregarding this salutary doctrine against prolonging strife would be greater than the benefit which would result from relieving some case of individual hardship."</p>\n<p><em>Reed v. Allen,</em> 286 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/191/case.html#198">286 U. S. 198</a></span>-199.</p>\n<p>Respondents make no serious effort to defend the decision of the Court of Appeals.  They do not ask that the decision below be affirmed.  Instead, they conclude that the "the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted."  Brief for Respondents 31.  In the alternative, they argue that</p>\n<p>"the district court\'s dismissal on grounds of <em>res judicata</em> should be reversed, and the district court directed to grant respondent\'s motion to remand to the California state court."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In their view, <em>Brown I</em> cannot be considered <em>res judicata</em> as to their state law claims, since <em>Brown I</em> raised only federal law claims, and <em>Brown II</em> raised additional state law claims not decided in <em>Brown I,</em> such as unfair competition, fraud, and restitution.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary for this Court to reach that issue.  It is enough for our decision here that <em>Brown I</em> is <em>res judicata</em> as to respondents\' federal law claims.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners have filed a supplemental memorandum with the Court indicating that <em>Moitie II</em> has been voluntarily dismissed, leaving <em>Brown II</em> as the subject of the petition.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court\'s conclusion that <em>Brown II</em> was properly removed to federal court, reasoning that the claims presented were "federal in nature."  We agree that at least some of the claims had  sufficient federal character to support removal.  As one treatise puts it, courts</p>\n<p>will not permit plaintiff to use artful pleading to close off defendant\'s right to  federal forum . . . , [and] occasionally the removal court will seek to determine whether the real nature of the claim is federal, regardless of plaintiff\'s characterization.</p>\n<p>14 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3722, pp. 564-566 (1976) (citing cases) (footnote omitted).  The District Court applied that settled principle to the facts of this case.  After "an extensive review and analysis of the origins and substance of" the two <em>Brown</em> complaints, it found, and the Court of Appeals expressly agreed, that respondents had attempted to avoid removal jurisdiction by "artful[ly]" casting their "essentially federal law claims" as state law claims.

S. 403</a></p><p> must give way to what the Court of Appeals referred to as "overriding concerns of public policy and simple justice."  611 F.2d 1267, 1269 (CA9 1980).  Professor Moore has noted:</p>\n<p>"Just as <em>res judicata</em> is occasionally qualified by an overriding, competing principle of public policy, so occasionally it needs an equitable tempering."</p>\n<p>1B J. Moore &amp; T. Currier, Moore\'s Federal Practice \xef\xbf\xbd 0.405 [12], p. 791 (1980) (footnote omitted).  <em>See also Reed v.

But this case is clearly not one in which equity requires that the doctrine give way.  Unlike the nonappealing party in <em>Reed,</em> respondents were not "caught in a mesh of procedural complexities."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Instead, they made a deliberate tactical decision not to appeal.  Nor would public policy be served by making an exception to the doctrine in this case; to the contrary, there is a special need for strict application of <em>res judicata</em> in complex multiple party actions of this sort so as to discourage "break-away" litigation.  <em>Cf. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html">442 U.

Finally, this is not a case</p>\n<p>"where the rights of appealing and nonappealing parties are so interwoven or dependent on each other as to require a reversal of the whole judgment when a part thereof is reversed."</p>\n<p><em>See Ford Motor Credit Co. v.

Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals found that those state law claims were simply disguised federal claims; since respondents have not cross-petitioned from that judgment, their argument that this case should be remanded to state court should be itself barred by <em>res judicata.</em>  More important, even if the state and federal claims are distinct, respondents\' failure to allege the state claims in <em>Brown I</em> manifestly bars their allegation in <em>Brown II.</em>  The dismissal of <em>Brown I</em> is <em>res judicata</em> not only as to all claims respondents actually raised, but also as to all claims that could have been raised.  <em>See Commissioner v.

Since there is no reason to believe that it was clear at the outset of this litigation that the District Court would have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over state claims, respondents were obligated to plead those claims if they wished to preserve them.  <em>See id.</em> \xc2\xa7 61.1, Comment <em>e</em>.

Unlike those cases, this is not one in which the appealing and nonappealing parties made competing claims to a single piece of property, <em>see McDill,</em> or in which reversal only as to the appealing party would have unjustly left the nonappealing party liable, <em>see Kvenild,</em> or without recourse on his cross-claim, <em>see Uresti.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In its eagerness to correct the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Court today disregards statutory restrictions on federal court jurisdiction, and, in the process, confuses, rather than clarifies, long-established principles of <em>res judicata.</em>  I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Floyd R. Brown [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] filed this class action (<em>Brown II</em>) against petitioners in California state court.  The complaint </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 452 U.

Plaintiffs\' Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 11-14, App. 99-101.  It alleged "not less than $600" damages per class member, and in addition sought "appropriate multiple damages," exemplary and punitive damages, interest from date of injury, attorney\'s fees and costs, and other relief.  <em>Id.</em> at 101-102.  All four of the causes of action rested wholly on California statutory or common law; none rested in any fashion on federal law.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, petitioners removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, where respondent Brown filed a motion to remand on the ground that his action raised no federal question within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1441(b).  Respondent\'s motion was denied by the District Court, which stated that "[f]rom start to finish, plaintiffs have essentially alleged violations by defendants of federal antitrust laws."  App.192.  The court reasoned that "[a]rtful pleading" by plaintiffs cannot "convert their essentially federal law claims into state law claims," and held that respondent\'s complaint was properly removed "because [it] concerned federal questions which could have been originally brought in Federal District Court without satisfying any minimum amount in controversy."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court then dismissed the action, holding that, under the doctrine of <em>res judicata, Brown II</em> was barred by the adverse decision in an earlier suit in federal court (<em>Brown I</em>) involving "the same parties, the same alleged offenses, and the same time periods."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s decision not to remand, stating that "[t]he court below correctly held that the claims presented were federal in nature."  611 F.2d 1267, 1268 (CA9 1980) (memorandum on denial of reconsideration).  However, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s order of dismissal, and remanded for trial. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 452 U.

Where the plaintiff\'s claim might </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 452 U. S. 407</a></p><p> be brought under either federal or state law, the plaintiff is normally free to ignore the federal question and rest his claim solely on the state ground.  If he does so, the defendant has no general right of removal.  <em>Jones v. General Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</em> 541 F.2d 660, 664 665 (CA7 1976); <em>La Chemise Lacoste v.

AFA Protective Systems, Inc.,</em> 392 F.Supp. 158, 160 (SDNY 1975)</p>\n<p>This corollary is well grounded in principles of federalism.  So long as States retain authority to legislate in subject areas in which Congress has legislated without preempting the field, and so long as state courts remain the preferred forum for interpretation and enforcement of state law, plaintiffs must be permitted to proceed in state court under state law.  It would do violence to state autonomy were defendants able to remove state claims to federal court merely because the plaintiff could have asserted a federal claim based on the same set of facts underlying his state claim.  As this Court stated in <em>Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Sheets,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/100/case.html">313 U.

S. 408</a></p><p> federal law or under state law as an independent source of that right, the federal court on removal proceedings may not generally look beyond the face of the initial pleading in the state action to determine whether a federal question is presented.  In certain areas, however, this either-or option is no longer available, for Congress has deemed that federal substantive law should altogether preempt and supplant state law.  In such a case, where Congress has explicitly said that the exclusive source of a plaintiff\'s right to relief is to be federal law, it would be unacceptable to permit that very plaintiff, by the artful manipulation of the terms of a complaint, to defeat a clearly enunciated congressional objective."</p>\n<p><em>Hearst Corp. v. Shopping Center Network, Inc.,</em> 307 F.Supp. 551, 556 (SDNY 1969) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).  The federal court must therefore scrutinize the complaint in the removed case to determine whether the action, though ostensibly grounded solely on state law, is actually grounded on a claim in which federal law is the exclusive authority.  <em>See Sheeran v. General Electric Co.,</em> 593 F.2d 93, 96 (CA9), <em>cert. denied,</em> 444 U.S. 868 (1979); <em>North American Phillips Corp. v.

Thus, respondent Brown had the option of proceeding under state or federal law, or both.  So far as is apparent from the complaint, which was carefully limited to four California state law causes of action, this case arises wholly without reference to federal law.  Under settled principles of federal jurisdiction, therefore, respondent\'s lawsuit should not have been removed to federal court.  <em>See Gully v. First National Bank in Meridian,</em> 299 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html#113">299 U.

S. 397</a></span>, n. 2.  I do not understand what the Court means by this.  Which of the claims are federal in character?  Why are the claims federal in character?  In my view, they are all predicated solely on California law. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Certainly, none of them purports to state a claim under the federal antitrust laws, and the mere fact that plaintiffs might have chosen to proceed under the Clayton Act surely does not suffice to transmute their state claims into federal claims.</p>\n<p>The Court relies on what it calls a "factual finding" by the District Court, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] with which the Court of Appeals agreed, that "respondents had attempted to avoid removal jurisdiction by <em>artful[ly]\' casting their `essentially federal law claims\' as state law claims."  <em>Ibid.</em>  But this amounts to no more than </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 452 U.

Having reached out to assume jurisdiction, the Court inexplicably recoils from deciding the case.  The Court finds it "unnecessary" to reach the question of the <em>res judicata</em> effect of <em>Brown I</em> on respondents\' "<em>state</em> law claims."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/394/case.html#402">452 U.

"It is enough for our decision here," the Court says, "that <em>Brown I</em> is <em>res judicata</em> as to respondents\' federal law claims."  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>But respondents raised only state law claims; respondents did not raise any federal law claims.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 452 U. S. 411</a></p><p> Thus, if the Court fails to decide the disposition of respondents\' state law claims, it decides nothing.  And in doing so, the Court introduces the possibility -- heretofore foreclosed by our decisions [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] -- that unarticulated theories of recovery may survive an unconditional dismissal of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Like JUSTICE BLACKMUN, I would hold that the dismissal of <em>Brown I</em> is <em>res judicata</em> not only as to every matter that was actually litigated, but also as to every ground or theory of recovery that might also have been presented.  <em>See ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/394/case.html#402">452 U.

The Court\'s failure to acknowledge this basic principle can only create doubts and confusion where none were before, and may encourage litigants to split their causes of action, state from federal, in the hope that they might win a second day in court.</p>\n<p>I therefore respectfully dissent, and would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand to the District Court with instructions to remand to state court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Since the action by respondent Moitie has been voluntarily dismissed, the only remaining issues concern the claims of respondent Brown.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>As the District Court acknowledged, <em>Brown II</em> could not be removed on the basis of diversity of citizenship, because the amount in controversy did not exceed $10,000.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3722, pp. 564-566 (1976), reports that "occasionally the removal court will seek to determine whether the real nature of the claim is federal, regardless of plaintiff\'s characterization."  (Footnote omitted.)  Perusal of the cited decisions, however, reveals that most of them correctly confine this practice to areas of the law preempted by federal substantive law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Brown v.
