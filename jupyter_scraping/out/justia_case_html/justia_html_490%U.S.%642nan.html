Atonio</b></p><p><b>No. 87-1387</b></p><p><b>Argued January 18, 1989</b></p><p><b>Decided June 5, 1989</b></p><p><b>490 U.S. 642</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p><p>Jobs at petitioners\' Alaskan salmon canneries are of two general types:  unskilled "cannery jobs" on the cannery lines, which are filled predominantly by nonwhites; and "noncannery jobs," most of which are classified as skilled positions and filled predominantly with white workers, and virtually all of which pay more than cannery positions.  Respondents, a class of nonwhite cannery workers at petitioners\' facilities, filed suit in the District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that various of petitioners\' hiring/promotion practices were responsible for the workforce\'s racial stratification and had denied them employment as noncannery workers on the basis of race.  The District Court rejected respondents\' claims, finding, among other things, that nonwhite workers were overrepresented in cannery jobs because many of those jobs were filled under a hiring hall agreement with a predominantly nonwhite union.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed in pertinent part, holding, <em>inter alia,</em> that respondents had made out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact in hiring for both skilled and unskilled noncannery jobs, relying solely on respondents\' statistics showing a high percentage of nonwhite workers in cannery jobs and a low percentage of such workers in noncannery positions.  The court also concluded that, once a plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the challenged practice\'s business necessity.</p><p><em>Held:</em></p><p>1. The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a <em>prima facie</em> disparate impact case.  Rather, the proper comparison is generally between the racial composition of the at-issue jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market.  <em>Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/299/case.html">433 U. S. 299</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/299/case.html#308">433 U. S. 308</a></span>.  With respect to the skilled noncannery jobs at issue, the cannery workforce in no way reflected the pool of job applicants or the <em>qualified</em> labor force population.  Petitioners\' selection methods or employment practices cannot be said to have had a disparate impact on nonwhites if </p><p><a class="page-number">Page 490 U. S. 643</a></p><p> the absence of minorities holding such skilled jobs reflects a dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants for reasons that are not petitioners\' fault.  With respect to the unskilled noncannery jobs, as long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified nonwhites from applying, the employer\'s selection mechanism probably does not have a disparate impact on minorities if the percentage of selected nonwhite applicants is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified nonwhite applicants.  Where this is the case, the percentage of nonwhite workers found in other positions in the employer\'s labor force is irrelevant to a <em>prima facie</em> statistical disparate impact case.  Moreover, isolating the cannery workers as the potential labor force for unskilled noncannery jobs is both too broad -- because the majority of cannery workers did not seek noncannery jobs -- and too narrow -- because there are many qualified persons in the relevant labor market who are not cannery workers.  Under the Court of Appeals\' method of comparison, any employer having a racially imbalanced segment of its workforce could be haled into court and made to undertake the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the business necessity of its selection methods.  For many employers, the only practicable option would be the adoption of racial quotas, which has been rejected by this Court and by Congress in drafting Title VII.  The Court of Appeals\' theory is also flawed because, if minorities are overrepresented in cannery jobs by virtue of petitioners\' having contracted with a predominantly nonwhite union to fill those positions, as the District Court found, petitioners could eliminate respondents\' <em>prima facie</em> case simply by ceasing to use the union, <em>without making any change whatsoever</em> in their hiring practices for the noncannery positions at issue.

On remand for a determination whether the record will support a <em>prima facie</em> disparate impact case on some basis other than the racial disparity between cannery and noncannery workers, a mere showing that nonwhites are underrepresented in the at-issue jobs in a manner that is acceptable under the standards set forth herein will not alone suffice.  Rather, the courts below must also require, as part of respondents\' <em>prima facie</em> case, a demonstration that the statistical disparity complained of is the result of one or more of the employment practices respondents are attacking here, specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites.  This specific causation requirement is not unduly burdensome, since liberal discovery rules give plaintiffs broad access to employers\' records, and since employers falling within the scope of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures must maintain records disclosing the impact of tests and selection procedures </p><p><a class="page-number">Page 490 U.

S. 656</a></span>-658.</p><p>3. If, on remand, respondents establish a <em>prima facie</em> disparate impact case with respect to any of petitioners\' practices, the burden of producing evidence of a legitimate business justification for those practices will shift to petitioners, but the burden of persuasion will remain with respondents at all times.  This rule conforms with the usual method for allocating persuasion and production burdens in the federal courts and with the rule in disparate treatment cases that the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer\'s assertion that the adverse employment practice was based solely on a legitimate, neutral consideration.  <em>See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/248/case.html">450 U.

To the extent that some of this Court\'s decisions speak of an employer\'s "burden of proof" with respect to the business justification defense, they should be understood to mean an employer\'s burden of production, not persuasion.  Even if respondents cannot persuade the trier of fact on the business necessity question, they may still prevail by coming forward with alternatives that reduce the disparate impact of petitioners\' current practices, provided such alternatives are equally effective in achieving petitioners\' legitimate employment goals in light of the alternatives\' costs and other burdens.

The canneries operate only during the salmon runs in the summer months.  They are inoperative and vacant for the rest of the year.  In May or June of each year, a few weeks before the salmon runs begin, workers arrive and prepare the equipment and facilities for the canning operation.  Most of these workers possess a variety of skills.  When salmon runs are about to begin, the workers who will operate the cannery lines arrive, remain as long as there are fish to can, and then depart.  The canneries are then closed down, winterized, and left vacant until the next spring.  During the off-season, the companies employ only a small number of individuals at their headquarters in Seattle and Astoria, Oregon, plus some employees at the winter shipyard in Seattle.</p>\n<p>The length and size of salmon runs vary from year to year, and hence the number of employees needed at each cannery also varies.  Estimates are made as early in the winter as possible; the necessary employees are hired, and when the time comes, they are transported to the canneries.  Salmon must be processed soon after they are caught, and the work during the canning season is therefore intense. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  For this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 490 U. S. 647</a></p><p> reason, and because the canneries are located in remote regions, all workers are housed at the canneries and have their meals in company-owned mess halls.</p>\n<p>Jobs at the canneries are of two general types:  "cannery jobs" on the cannery line, which are unskilled positions; and "noncannery jobs," which fall into a variety of classifications.  Most noncannery jobs are classified as skilled positions. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Cannery jobs are filled predominantly by nonwhites:  Filipinos and Alaska Natives.  The Filipinos are hired through, and dispatched by, Local 37 of the International Longshoremen\'s and Warehousemen\'s Union pursuant to a hiring hall agreement with the local.  The Alaska Natives primarily reside in villages near the remote cannery locations.  Noncannery jobs are filled with predominantly white workers, who are hired during the winter months from the companies\' offices in Washington and Oregon.  Virtually all of the noncannery jobs pay more than cannery positions.  The predominantly white noncannery workers and the predominantly nonwhite cannery employees live in separate dormitories and eat in separate mess halls.</p>\n<p>In 1974, respondents, a class of nonwhite cannery workers who were (or had been) employed at the canneries, brought this Title VII action against petitioners.  Respondents alleged that a variety of petitioners\' hiring/promotion practices -- e. g., nepotism, a rehire preference, a lack of objective hiring criteria, separate hiring channels, a practice of not promoting from within -- were responsible for the racial stratification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="648">Page 490 U. S. 648</a></p><p> of the workforce, and had denied them and other nonwhites employment as noncannery workers on the basis of race.  Respondents also complained of petitioners\' racially segregated housing and dining facilities.  All of respondents\' claims were advanced under both the disparate treatment and disparate impact theories of Title VII liability.</p>\n<p>The District Court held a bench trial, after which it entered 172 findings of fact.  App. to Pet. for Cert. I-1 to I-94.  It then rejected all of respondents\' disparate treatment claims.  It also rejected the disparate impact challenges involving the subjective employment criteria used by petitioners to fill these noncannery positions, on the ground that those criteria were not subject to attack under a disparate impact theory.  <em>Id.</em> at I-102.  Petitioners\' "objective" employment practices (<em>e.g.,</em> an English language requirement, alleged nepotism in hiring, failure to post noncannery openings, the rehire preference, etc.) were found to be subject to challenge under the disparate impact theory, but these claims were rejected for failure of proof.  Judgment was entered for petitioners.</p>\n<p>On appeal, a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 768 F.2d 1120 (1985), but that decision was vacated when the Court of Appeals agreed to hear the case <em>en banc,</em> 787 F.2d 462 (1985).  The <em>en banc</em> hearing was ordered to settle an intracircuit conflict over the question whether subjective hiring practices could be analyzed under a disparate impact model; the Court of Appeals held -- as this Court subsequently ruled in <em>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html">487 U. S. 977</a></span> (1988) -- that disparate impact analysis could be applied to subjective hiring practices.  810 F.2d 1477, 1482 (1987).  The Ninth Circuit also concluded that, in such a case,</p>\n<p>"[o]nce the plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 1485, to "prov[e the] business necessity" of the challenged practice, <em>id.</em> at 1486.  Because the <em>en banc</em> holding on subjective employment practices reversed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="649">Page 490 U. S. 649</a></p><p> the District Court\'s contrary ruling, the <em>en banc</em> Court of Appeals remanded the case to a panel for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>On remand, the panel applied the <em>en banc</em> ruling to the facts of this case.  827 F.2d 439 (1987).  It held that respondents had made out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact in hiring for both skilled and unskilled noncannery positions.  The panel remanded the case for further proceedings, instructing the District Court that it was the employer\'s burden to prove that any disparate impact caused by its hiring and employment practices was justified by business necessity.  Neither the <em>en banc</em> court nor the panel disturbed the District Court\'s rejection of the disparate treatment claims. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners sought review of the Court of Appeals\' decision in this Court, challenging it on several grounds.

Alternatively, in cases where such labor market statistics will be difficult if not impossible to ascertain, we have recognized that certain other statistics -- such as measures indicating the racial composition of "otherwise-qualified applicants" for at-issue jobs -- are equally probative for this purpose.  <em>See, e.g., New York City Transit Authority v.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>It is clear to us that the Court of Appeals\' acceptance of the comparison between the racial composition of the cannery workforce and that of the noncannery workforce, as probative of a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact in the selection of the latter group of workers, was flawed for several reasons.  Most obviously, with respect to the skilled noncannery jobs at issue here, the cannery workforce in no way reflected "the pool of <em>qualified</em> job applicants" or the "<em>qualified</em> population in the labor force."  Measuring alleged discrimination in the selection of accountants, managers, boat captains, electricians, doctors, and engineers -- and the long list of other "skilled" noncannery positions found to exist by the District Court, <em>see</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. I-56 to I-58 -- by comparing the number of nonwhites occupying these jobs to the number of nonwhites filling cannery worker positions is nonsensical.  If the absence of minorities holding such skilled positions is due to a dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants (for reasons that are not petitioners\' fault), [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 490 U. S. 652</a></p><p> petitioners\' selection methods or employment practices cannot be said to have had a "disparate impact" on nonwhites.</p>\n<p>One example illustrates why this must be so.  Respondents\' own statistics concerning the noncannery workforce at one of the canneries at issue here indicate that approximately 17% of the new hires for medical jobs, and 15% of the new hires for officer worker positions, were nonwhite.  <em>See</em> App. to Brief for Respondents B-l.  If it were the case that less than 15 to 17% of the applicants for these jobs were nonwhite and that nonwhites made up a lower percentage of the relevant qualified labor market, it is hard to see how respondents, without more, <em>cf. Connecticut v. Teal,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/440/case.html">457 U. S. 440</a></span> (1982), would have made out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact.  Yet, under the Court of Appeals\' theory, simply because nonwhites comprise 52% of the cannery workers at the cannery in question, <em>see</em> App. to Brief for Respondents B-1, respondents would be successful in establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case of racial discrimination under Title VII.</p>\n<p>Such a result cannot be squared with our cases or with the goals behind the statute.  The Court of Appeals\' theory, at the very least, would mean that any employer who had a segment of his workforce that was -- for some reason -- racially imbalanced, could be haled into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the "business necessity" of the methods used to select the other members of his workforce.  The only practicable option for many employers would be to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their workforces deviated in racial composition from the other portions thereof; this is a result that Congress expressly rejected in drafting Title VII.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(j); <em>see also Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/879/case.html#922">487 U. S. 922</a></span>-994, and n. 2 (opinion of O\'CONNOR, J.).  The Court of Appeals\' theory would "leave the employer little choice . . . but to engage in a subjective quota system of employment selection.  This, of course, is far from the intent of Title VII."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 490 U. S. 653</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html">422 U.

S. 449</a></span> (1975) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also erred with respect to the unskilled noncannery positions.  Racial imbalance in one segment of an employer\'s workforce does not, without more, establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact with respect to the selection of workers for the employer\'s other positions, even where workers for the different positions may have somewhat fungible skills (as is arguably the case for cannery and unskilled noncannery workers).  As long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified nonwhites from applying for noncannery positions, <em>see</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra,</em> if the percentage of selected applicants who are nonwhite is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified applicants who are nonwhite, the employer\'s selection mechanism probably does not operate with a disparate impact on minorities [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Where this is the case, the percentage of nonwhite workers found in other positions in the employer\'s labor force is irrelevant to the question of a <em>prima facie</em> statistical case of disparate impact.  As noted above, a contrary ruling on this point would almost inexorably lead to the use of numerical quotas in the workplace, a result that Congress and this Court have rejected repeatedly in the past.</p>\n<p>Moreover, isolating the cannery workers as the potential "labor force" for unskilled noncannery positions is at once both too broad and too narrow in its focus.  It is too broad because the vast majority of these cannery workers did not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 490 U. S. 654</a></p><p> seek jobs in unskilled noncannery positions; there is no showing that many of them would have done so even if none of the arguably "deterring" practices existed.  Thus, the pool of cannery workers cannot be used as a surrogate for the class of qualified job applicants, because it contains many persons who have not (and would not) be noncannery job applicants.  Conversely, if respondents propose to use the cannery workers for comparison purposes because they represent the "qualified labor population" generally, the group is too narrow, because there are obviously many qualified persons in the labor market for noncannery jobs who are not cannery workers.</p>\n<p>The peculiar facts of this case further illustrate why a comparison between the percentage of nonwhite cannery workers and nonwhite noncannery workers is an improper basis for making out a claim of disparate impact.  Here, the District Court found that nonwhites were "overrepresent[ed]" among cannery workers because petitioners had contracted with a predominantly nonwhite union (local 37) to fill these positions.  <em>See</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. I-42.  As a result, if petitioners (for some permissible reason) ceased using local 37 as its hiring channel for cannery positions, it appears (according to the District Court\'s findings) that the racial stratification between the cannery and noncannery workers might diminish to statistical insignificance.  Under the Court of Appeals\' approach, therefore, it is possible that, <em>with no change whatsoever</em> in their hiring practices for noncannery workers -- the jobs at issue in this lawsuit -- petitioners could make respondents\' <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact "disappear."  But if there would be no <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact in the selection of noncannery workers absent petitioners\' use of local 37 to hire cannery workers, surely petitioners\' reliance on the union to fill the cannery jobs not at issue here (and its resulting "overrepresentation" of nonwhites in those positions) does not -- standing alone -- make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact.  Yet it is precisely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 490 U. S. 655</a></p><p> such an ironic result that the Court of Appeals reached below.</p>\n<p>Consequently, we reverse the Court of Appeals\' ruling that a comparison between the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact.  Of course, this leaves unresolved whether the record made in the District Court will support a conclusion that a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact has been established on some basis other than the racial disparity between cannery and noncannery workers.  This is an issue that the Court of Appeals or the District Court should address in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Since the statistical disparity relied on by the Court of Appeals did not suffice to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case, any inquiry by us into whether the specific challenged employment practices of petitioners caused that disparity is pretermitted, as is any inquiry into whether the disparate impact that any employment practice may have had was justified by business considerations. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Because we remand for further proceedings, however, on whether a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact has been made in defensible fashion in this case, we address two other challenges petitioners have made to the decision of the Court of Appeals. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="656">Page 490 U.

The law in this respect was correctly stated by JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'S opinion last Term in <em>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html#994">487 U. S. 994</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"[W]e note that the plaintiff\'s burden in establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case goes beyond the need to show that there are statistical disparities in the employer\'s workforce.  The plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged. . . .  Especially in cases where an employer combines subjective criteria with the use of more rigid standardized rules or tests, the plaintiff is in our view responsible for isolating and identifying the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities."</p>\n<p><em>Cf. also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html#1000">487 U.

Notwithstanding the Court of Appeals\' apparent adherence to the proper inquiry, petitioners contend that that court erred by permitting respondents to make out their case by offering</p>\n<p>"only [one] set of cumulative comparative statistics as evidence of the disparate impact of each and all of [petitioners\' hiring] practices."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners 31.</p>\n<p>Our disparate impact cases have always focused on the impact of <em>particular</em> hiring practices on employment opportunities for minorities.  Just as an employer cannot escape liability under Title VII by demonstrating that, "at the bottom line," his workforce is racially balanced (where particular hiring practices may operate to deprive minorities of employment opportunities), <em>see Connecticut v. Teal,</em> 457 U.S. at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="657">Page 490 U. S. 657</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/440/case.html#450">457 U. S. 450</a></span>, a Title VII plaintiff does not make out a case of disparate impact simply by showing that, "at the bottom line," there is racial <em>imbalance</em> in the workforce.  As a general matter, a plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under attack.  Such a showing is an integral part of the plaintiff\'s <em>prima facie</em> case in a disparate impact suit under Title VII.</p>\n<p>Here, respondents have alleged that several "objective" employment practices (<em>e.g.,</em> nepotism, separate hiring channels, rehire preferences), as well as the use of "subjective decision making" to select noncannery workers, have had a disparate impact on nonwhites.  Respondents base this claim on statistics that allegedly show a disproportionately low percentage of nonwhites in the at-issue positions.  However, even if, on remand, respondents can show that nonwhites are underrepresented in the at-issue jobs in a manner that is acceptable under the standards set forth in Part II, supra, this alone will <em>not</em> suffice to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact.  Respondents will also have to demonstrate that the disparity they complain of is the result of one or more of the employment practices that they are attacking here, specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites.  To hold otherwise would result in employers being potentially liable for "the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances in the composition of their workforces."  <em>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html#992">487 U. S. 992</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Some will complain that this specific causation requirement is unduly burdensome on Title VII plaintiffs.  But liberal civil discovery rules give plaintiffs broad access to employers\' records in an effort to document their claims.  Also, employers falling within the scope of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 CFR \xc2\xa71607.1 <em>et seq.</em> (1988), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 490 U. S. 658</a></p><p> are required to</p>\n<p>"maintain . . . records or other information which will disclose the impact which its tests and other selection procedures have upon employment opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic group[s]."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> \xc2\xa71607.4(A).  This includes records concerning "the individual components of the selection process" where there is a significant disparity in the selection rates of whites and nonwhites.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa71607.4(C).  Plaintiffs as a general matter will have the benefit of these tools to meet their burden of showing a causal link between challenged employment practices and racial imbalances in the workforce; respondents presumably took full advantage of these opportunities to build their case before the trial in the District Court was held. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Consequently, on remand, the courts below are instructed to require, as part of respondents\' <em>prima facie</em> case, a demonstration that specific elements of the petitioners\' hiring process have a significantly disparate impact on nonwhites.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>If, on remand, respondents meet the proof burdens outlined above, and establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact with respect to any of petitioners\' employment practices, the case will shift to any business justification petitioners offer for their use of these practices.  This phase of the disparate impact case contains two components: first, a consideration of the justifications an employer offers for his use of these practices; and second, the availability of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less racial impact.  <em>See, e.g., Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#425">422 U. S. 425</a></span>.

Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</em> 487 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html#997">487 U. S. 997</a></span>-999; <em>New York City Transit Authority v.

A mere insubstantial justification in this regard will not suffice, because such a low standard of review would permit discrimination to be practiced through the use of spurious, seemingly neutral employment practices.  At the same time, though, there is no requirement that the challenged practice be "essential" or "indispensable" to the employer\'s business for it to pass muster:  this degree of scrutiny would be almost impossible for most employers to meet, and would result in a host of evils we have identified above.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/case.html#652">490 U. S. 652</a></span>-653.</p>\n<p>In this phase, the employer carries the burden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice.  The burden of persuasion, however, remains with the disparate impact plaintiff.  To the extent that the Ninth Circuit held otherwise in its <em>en banc</em> decision in this case, <em>see</em> 810 F.2d at 1485-1486, or in the panel\'s decision on remand, <em>see</em> 827 F.2d at 445, 447 -- suggesting that the persuasion burden should shift to petitioners once respondents established a <em>prima facie</em> case of disparate impact -- its decisions were erroneous.</p>\n<p>"[T]he ultimate burden of proving that discrimination against a protected group has been caused by a specific employment practice remains with the plaintiff <em>at all times.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Watson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/977/case.html#997">487 U.

It bars the use of internal workforce comparisons in the making of a <em>prima</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 490 U.

And it requires practice-by-practice statistical proof of causation, even where, as here, such proof would be impossible.</p>\n<p>The harshness of these results is well demonstrated by the facts of this case.  The salmon industry as described by this record takes us back to a kind of overt and institutionalized discrimination we have not dealt with in years:  a total residential and work environment organized on principles of racial stratification and segregation, which, as JUSTICE STEVENS points out, resembles a plantation economy.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/case.html#664">490 U.

This industry long has been characterized by a taste for discrimination of the old-fashioned sort:  a preference for hiring nonwhites to fill its lowest level positions, on the condition that they stay there.  The majority\'s legal rulings essentially immunize these practices from attack under a Title VII disparate impact analysis.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this comes as no surprise.  One wonders whether the majority still believes that race discrimination -- or, more accurately, race discrimination against nonwhites -- is a problem in our society, or even remembers that it ever was.  <em>Cf.

S. 253</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Decisions of this Court and other federal courts repeatedly have recognized that, while the employer\'s burden in a disparate treatment case is simply one of coming forward with evidence of legitimate business purpose, its burden in a disparate impact case is proof of an affirmative defense of business necessity. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Although the majority\'s opinion blurs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="669">Page 490 U.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  In the ordinary civil trial, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant has harmed her.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 328 A, 433 B (1965) (hereinafter Restatement).  The defendant may undercut plaintiff\'s efforts both by confronting plaintiff\'s evidence during her case in chief and by submitting countervailing evidence during its own case. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  But if the plaintiff proves the existence of the harmful act, the defendant can escape liability only by persuading the factfinder that the act was justified or excusable.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Restatement \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7454-461, 463-467.  The plaintiff in turn may try to refute this affirmative defense.  Although the burdens of producing evidence regarding the existence of harm or excuse thus shift between the plaintiff </p><p><a class="page-number" name="670">Page 490 U. S. 670</a></p><p> and the defendant, the burden of proving either proposition remains throughout on the party asserting it.</p>\n<p>In a disparate treatment case, there is no "discrimination" within the meaning of Title VII unless the employer intentionally treated the employee unfairly because of race.  Therefore, the employee retains the burden of proving the existence of intent at all times.  If there is direct evidence of intent, the employee may have little difficulty persuading the factfinder that discrimination has occurred.  But in the likelier event that intent has to be established by inference, the employee may resort to the <em>McDonnell/Burdine</em> inquiry.  In either instance, the employer may undermine the employee\'s evidence, but has no independent burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p>In contrast, intent plays no role in the disparate impact inquiry.  The question, rather, is whether an employment practice has a significant adverse effect on an identifiable class of workers -- regardless of the cause or motive for the practice.  The employer may attempt to contradict the factual basis for this effect; that is, to prevent the employee from establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case.  But when an employer is faced with sufficient proof of disparate impact, its only recourse is to justify the practice by explaining why it is necessary to the operation of business.  Such a justification is a classic example of an affirmative defense. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 490 U. S. 671</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Failing to explore the interplay between these distinct orders of proof, the Court announces that our frequent statements that the employer shoulders the burden of proof respecting business necessity "should have been understood to mean an employer\'s production -- but not persuasion -- burden."

Canneries often are located in remote, sparsely populated areas of Alaska.  34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,825 (WD Wash. 1983).  Most jobs are seasonal, with the season\'s length and the canneries\' personnel needs varying not just year to year, but day to day.  <em>Ibid.</em>  To fill their employment requirements, petitioners must recruit and transport many cannery workers and noncannery workers from States in the Pacific Northwest.  <em>Id.</em> at 33,828.  Most cannery workers come from a union local based outside Alaska or from Native villages near the canneries.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Employees in the noncannery positions -- the positions that are "at issue" -- learn of openings by word of mouth; the jobs seldom are posted or advertised, and there is no promotion to noncannery jobs from within the cannery workers\' ranks.  <em>Id.</em> at 33,827-33,828.</p>\n<p>In general, the District Court found the at-issue jobs to require "skills," ranging from English literacy, typing, and "ability to use seam micrometers, gauges, and mechanic\'s hand tools" to "good health" and a driver\'s license. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 490 U. S. 675</a></p><p> 33,833-33,834.  All cannery workers\' jobs, like a handful of at-issue positions, are unskilled, and the court found that the intensity of the work during canning season precludes on-the-job training for skilled noncannery positions.  <em>Id.</em> at 33,825.  It made no findings regarding the extent to which the cannery workers already are qualified for at-issue jobs:  individual plaintiffs testified persuasively that they were fully qualified for such jobs, [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] but the court neither credited nor discredited this testimony.  Although there are no findings concerning wage differentials, the parties seem to agree that wages for cannery workers are lower than those for noncannery workers, skilled or unskilled.  The District Court found that "nearly all" cannery workers are nonwhite, while the percentage of nonwhites employed in the entire Alaska salmon canning industry "has stabilized at about 47% to 50%."  <em>Id.</em> at 33,829.  The precise stratification of the workforce is not described in the findings, but the parties seem to agree that the noncannery jobs are predominantly held by whites.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that the relevant labor market in this case is the general population of the "<em>external\' labor market for the jobs at issue."  Brief for Petitioners 17.  While they would rely on the District Court\'s findings in this regard, those findings are ambiguous.  At one point, the District Court specifies "Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and California" as "the geographical region from which [petitioners] draw their employees," but its next finding refers to "this relevant geographical area for cannery worker, laborer, and other nonskilled jobs," 34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,828.  There </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 490 U. S. 676</a></em></p><p><em> is no express finding of the relevant labor market for noncannery Jobs.\n</em></p>\n<p>Even assuming that the District Court properly defined the relevant geographical area, its apparent assumption that the population in that area constituted the "available labor supply," <em>ibid.,</em> is not adequately founded.  An undisputed requirement for employment either as a cannery or noncannery worker is availability for seasonal employment in the far reaches of Alaska.  Many noncannery workers, furthermore, must be available for preseason work.  <em>Id.</em> at 33,829, 33,833-33,834.  Yet the record does not identify the portion of the general population in Alaska, California, and the Pacific Northwest that would accept this type of employment. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  This deficiency respecting a crucial job qualification diminishes the usefulness of petitioners\' statistical evidence.  In contrast, respondents\' evidence, comparing racial compositions within the workforce, identifies a pool of workers willing to work during the relevant times and familiar with the workings of the industry.  Surely this is more probative than the untailored general population statistics on which petitioners focus.  <em>Cf.

[<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]  But such evidence of racial stratification puts the specific employment practices challenged by respondents into perspective.  Petitioners recruit employees for at-issue jobs from outside the workforce, rather than from lower paying, overwhelmingly nonwhite cannery worker positions.  34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,828-33,829.  Information about availability of at-issue positions is conducted by word of mouth; [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>] therefore, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 490 U.

Putting to one side the issue of business justifications, it would be quite wrong to conclude that these practices have no discriminatory consequence.

The class members, described by the parties as "nonwhite," include persons of Samoan, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Alaska Native descent, all but one of whom are United States citizens.  34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, pp. 33,822, 33,836-33,838 (WD Wash. 1983).  Fifteen years ago, they commenced this suit, alleging that petitioners engage in hiring, job assignment, housing, and messing practices that segregate nonwhites from whites in violation of Title VII.  Evidence included this response in 1971 by a foreman to a college student\'s inquiry about cannery employment:</p>\n<p>"We are not in a position to take many young fellows to our Bristol Bay canneries, as they do not have the background for our type of employees.  Our cannery labor is either Eskimo or Filipino, and we do not have the facilities to mix others with these groups."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 33,836.</p>\n<p>Some characteristics of the Alaska salmon industry described in this litigation -- in particular, the segregation of housing and dining facilities and the stratification of jobs along racial and ethnic lines -- bear an unsettling resemblance to aspects of a plantation economy.  <em>See generally</em> Plantation, Town, and County, Essays on the Local History of American Slave Society 163-334 (E. Miller &amp; E. Genovese eds. 1974).  Indeed the maintenance of inferior, segregated facilities for housing and feeding nonwhite employees, <em>see</em> 34 EPD n 34,437, pp. 33,836, 33,843-33,844, strikes me as a form of discrimination that, although it does not necessarily fit neatly into a disparate impact or disparate treatment mold, nonetheless violates Title VII.  <em>See generally</em> Brief for National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as <em>Amicus Curiae.</em>  Respondents, however, do not press this theory before us.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court noted that census statistics showed that in the employer\'s State, North Carolina,</p>\n<p>"while 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12% of Negro males had done so. . . .

Respondent, however, appears in different clothing.  He had engaged in a seriously disruptive act against the very one from whom he now seeks employment.  And petitioner does not seek his exclusion on the basis of a testing device which overstates what is necessary for competent performance, or through some sweeping disqualification of all those with any past record of unlawful behavior, however remote, insubstantial, or unrelated to applicant\'s personal qualifications as an employee.

Some had college training at the time they were employed in the canneries.  <em>See id.</em> at 33,837-33,838; App. 38, 52-53; Tr. 76, 951-952, 1036, 1050, 2214.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/23" name="F2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s justification for use of general population statistics occurs in these findings of fact:</p>\n<p>"119. Most of the jobs at the canneries entail migrant, seasonal labor.  While, as a general proposition, most people prefer full-year, fixed location employment near their homes, seasonal employment in the unique salmon industry is not comparable to most other types of migrant work, such as fruit and vegetable harvesting which, for example, may or may not involve a guaranteed wage."</p>\n<p>"120. Thus, while census data is [<em>sic</em>] dominated by people who prefer full-year, fixed-location employment, such data is [<em>sic</em>] nevertheless appropriate in defining labor supplies for migrant, seasonal work."</p>\n<p>34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,829.  The court\'s rather confusing distinction between work in the cannery industry and other "migrant, seasonal work" does not support its conclusion that the general population composes the relevant labor market.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/24" name="F2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, from 1971 to 1980, there were 443 persons hired in the job departments labeled "machinists," "company fishing boat," and "tender" at petitioner Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc.\'s Bumble Bee cannery; only 3 of them were nonwhites.  Joint Excerpt of Record 35 (Exh. 588).  In the same categories at the Red Salmon cannery of petitioner Wards Cove Packing Co., Inc., 488 whites and 42 nonwhites were hired.  <em>Id.</em> at 36 (Exh. 589).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/25" name="F2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court points out that nonwhites are "overrepresented" among the cannery workers.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/case.html#654">490 U. S. 654</a></span>.  Such an imbalance will be true in any racially stratified workforce; its significance becomes apparent only upon examination of the pattern of segregation within the workforce.  In the cannery industry, nonwhites are concentrated in positions offering low wages and little opportunity for promotion.  Absent any showing that the "underrepresentation" of whites in this stratum is the result of a barrier to access, the "overrepresentation" of nonwhites does not offend Title VII.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/26" name="F2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority suggests that at-issue work demands the skills possessed by "accountants, managers, boat captains, electricians, doctors, and engineers."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/case.html#651">490 U. S. 651</a></span>.  It is at least theoretically possible that a disproportionate number of white applicants possessed the specialized skills required by some at-issue jobs.  In fact, of course, many at-issue jobs involved skills not at all comparable to these selective examples.  <em>See</em> 34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,833-33,834.  Even the District Court recognized that, in a year-round employment setting, "some of the positions which this court finds to be skilled, <em>e.g.,</em> truckdriving on the beach, [would] fit into the category of jobs which require skills that are readily acquirable by persons in the general public."  <em>Id.</em> at 33,841.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/27" name="F2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals explained in its remand opinion:</p>\n<p>"Specifically, the companies sought cannery workers in Native villages and through dispatches from ILWU Local 37, thus securing a workforce for the lowest paying jobs which was predominantly Alaska Native and Filipino.  For other departments, the companies relied on informal word-of-mouth recruitment by predominantly white superintendents and foremen, who recruited primarily white employees.  That such practices can cause a discriminatory impact is obvious."</p>\n<p>827 F.2d at 446.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/28" name="F2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court found, but downplayed the fact, that relatives of employees are given preferential consideration.  <em>See</em> 34 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd 34,437, p. 33,840.  But "of 349 nepotistic hires in four upper-level departments during 1970-75, 332 were of whites, 17 of nonwhites," the Court of Appeals noted.</p>\n<p>"If nepotism exists, it is by definition a practice of giving preference to relatives, and where those doing the hiring are predominantly white, the practice necessarily has an adverse impact on nonwhites."</p>\n<p>827 F.2d at 445.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/29" name="F2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that the discrepancy in economic opportunities for white and nonwhite workers does not amount to disparate impact within the meaning of Title VII unless respondents show that it is "petitioners\' fault."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/642/case.html#651">490 U.

This statement distorts the disparate impact theory, in which the critical inquiry is whether an employer\'s practices operate to discriminate.  <em>E.g., Griggs,</em> 401 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/424/case.html#431">401 U.
