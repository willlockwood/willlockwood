Phillips, for the defendant in error, however, opened the record and prayed an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On examining the record, we find that four errors were assigned in the court below.  The first three relate to the form and sufficiency of the evidence offered to prove the record of the judgment in the District Court of the State of Kansas upon which the action was brought.  We think the objections were not well taken and that there was no error in overruling them.</p>\n<p>The fourth in to the effect that the judgment in the Kansas court was void because the cause was tried by the court without the waiver of a trial by jury entered upon the journal.  Whatever might be the effect of this omission in a proceeding to obtain a reversal or vacation of the judgment, it is very certain that it does not render the judgment void.  At most, it is only error, and cannot be taken advantage of collaterally.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p><em>NOTE\n</em></p>\n<p>A motion was afterwards made by Mr. J. S. Watts for the plaintiff in error to rehear the case, but the motion was denied.</p>\n<p>* Acts of 1868, p. 684, \xc2\xa7 289.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
