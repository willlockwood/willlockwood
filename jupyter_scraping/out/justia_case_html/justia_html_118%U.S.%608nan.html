S. 609</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The rule is settled that when a writ of error is sued out from this Court by the defendant below and no question is presented growing out of a partial defense to the action or a counterclaim or a set-off, the value of the matter in dispute is fixed by the amount of the judgment.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/28/33/case.html">Gordon v. Ogden,</a></span></em> 3 Pet. 33; <em>Hilton v. Dickinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/108/165/case.html">108 U. S. 165</a></span>; <em>Henderson v. Wadsworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/115/264/case.html#276">115 U. S. 276</a></span>.  Our jurisdiction cannot be invoked </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 118 U. S. 610</a></p><p> until after a final judgment, and, until such a judgment has been rendered, the cause remains in the full judicial control of the court in which it is pending.  It was because of this that we declined to take jurisdiction in <em>Thompson v. Butler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/95/694/case.html">95 U. S. 694</a></span>, where the verdict was for more than $5,000 but reduced to that amount by leave of the court before the judgment, which was for the reduced sum.  It is true that our jurisdiction depends on the amount of the judgment, exclusive of interest thereon, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/43/73/case.html">Knapp v. Banks,</a></span></em> 2 How. 73; <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Rogers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/565/case.html">93 U. S. 565</a></span>, 566 [argument of counsel -- omitted], but here the interest accrued before judgment, and not after.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/451/case.html">The Patapsco,</a></span></em> 12 Wall. 451, jurisdiction was taken in a case where the decree was for $1,982 "and interest from the date of the report," which made more than $2,000 due at the time of the decree, that being then the jurisdictional limit.</p>\n<p>As the jurisdiction has once attached, it cannot be defeated by a waiver or release of the amount in excess of $5,000.</p>\n<p><em>The motion to dismiss is denied.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
