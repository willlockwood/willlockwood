In cases \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d federal law, there is a presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if \xe2\x80\x9cCongress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tafflin v. Levitt, \n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 455\n\xe2\x80\x93459.  Arrow acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that \xc2\xa71331 creates no converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction.  Instead, Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces \xc2\xa71331, an earlier, more general prescription.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 1331 is not swept away so easily.  The principle that district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71331 when federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal courts of their \xc2\xa71331 adjudicatory authority.  See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635\n.  Accordingly, the District Court retains \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction over Mims\xe2\x80\x99s complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication.  See id., at 644.

Title \n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s language may be state-court oriented, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Bank of New York &amp; Trust Co., \n\n296 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463\n.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7227(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s permissive language makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to oust federal courts of their \xc2\xa71331 jurisdiction.  The provision does not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively\xe2\x80\x9d in state court.  In contrast, \n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011) vests \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over state-initiated TCPA suits in the federal courts.  Section 227(g)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s exclusivity prescription \xe2\x80\x9creinforce[s] the conclusion that [\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s] silence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. leaves the jurisdictional grant of \xc2\xa71331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Verizon Md., 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 644.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private action \xe2\x80\x9cin an appropriate [state] court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have concurrent jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all.  But, as already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court jurisdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state authorities, see \n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. A. \xc2\xa7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was also exclusive for private actions.  Moreover, by providing that private actions may be brought in state court \xe2\x80\x9cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [the] State,\xe2\x80\x9d \n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(3), Congress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to decide whether to entertain TCPA claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over \xc2\xa7227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress\xe2\x80\x99 objective of enabling States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded state law.  Even so, jurisdiction conferred by \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 should hold firm against \xe2\x80\x9cmere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n, n.\xc2\xa015.  Furthermore, had Congress sought only to fill a gap in the States\xe2\x80\x99 enforcement capabilities, it could have provided that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be subject to the receiving State\xe2\x80\x99s laws.  Instead, Congress enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tArrow\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, is misplaced.  The remarks nowhere mention federal-court jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that \n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(3) is intended to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims.  Even if Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to proceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  Arrow\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that federal courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.

Mims, complaining of multiple violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Services, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S.

Mims invoked the court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfederal question\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims \xe2\x80\x9carising under the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  The District Court, affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims\xe2\x80\x99s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Beyond doubt, the TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case.  We find no convincing reason to read into the TCPA\xe2\x80\x99s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the U.
