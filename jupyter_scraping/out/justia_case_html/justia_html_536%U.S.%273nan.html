FERPA\'s provisions speak only to the Secretary, directing that "[n]o funds shall be made available" to any "educational ... institution" which has a prohibited "policy or practice," \xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(I). This focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="275">275</a></p><p>and clearly does not confer the sort of <i>individual </i>entitlement that is enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983. <i>E. g., Cannon, supra, </i>at 690-693. Furthermore, because FERPA\'s confidentiality provisions speak only in terms of institutional "policy or practice," not individual instances of disclosure, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(1)-(2), they have an "aggregate" focus, they are not concerned with whether the needs of any particular person have been satisfied, and they cannot give rise to individual rights, <i>Blessing, supra, </i>at 344. The fact that recipient institutions can avoid termination of funding so long as they "comply substantially" with FERPA\'s requirements, \xc2\xa7 1234c(a), also supports a finding that FERPA fails to support a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit. 520 U. S., at 335, 343. References in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(1) and (2) to individual parental consent cannot make out the requisite congressional intent to confer individually enforceable rights because each of those references is made in the context of describing the type of "policy or practice" that triggers a funding prohibition. The conclusion that FERPA fails to confer enforceable rights is buttressed by the mechanism that Congress provided for enforcing FERPA violations. The Secretary is expressly authorized to "deal with violations," \xc2\xa7 1232g(f), and required to establish a review board to investigate and adjudicate such violations, \xc2\xa7 1232g(g). For these purposes, the Secretary created the Family Policy Compliance Office, which has promulgated procedures for resolving student complaints about suspected FERPA violations. These procedures squarely distinguish this case from <i>Wright </i>and <i>Wilder, </i>where an aggrieved individual lacked any federal review mechanism. Finally, because FERPA prohibits most of the Secretary\'s functions from being carried out in regional offices, \xc2\xa7 1232g(g), in order to allay the concern that regionalizing enforcement might lead to multiple interpretations of FERPA, it is implausible to presume that Congress nonetheless intended private suits to be brought before thousands of federal- and state-court judges.

He planned to graduate and teach at a Washington public elementary school. Washington at the time required all of its new teachers to obtain an affidavit of good moral character from a dean of their graduating college or university. In October 1993, Roberta League, Gonzaga\'s "teacher certification specialist," overheard one student tell another that respondent engaged in acts of sexual misconduct against Jane Doe, a female undergraduate. League launched an investigation and contacted the state agency responsible for teacher certification, identifying respondent by name and discussing the allegations against him. Respondent did not learn of the investigation, or that information about him had been disclosed, until March 1994, when he was told by League and others that he would not receive the affidavit required for certification as a Washington schoolteacher.</p><p>Respondent then sued Gonzaga and League (petitioners) in state court. He alleged violations of Washington tort and contract law, as well as a pendent violation of \xc2\xa7 1983 for the release of personal information to an "unauthorized person" in violation of FERPA.l A jury found for respondent on all counts, awarding him $1,155,000, including $150,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages on the FERPA claim.</p><p>1 The Washington Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court found petitioners to have acted "under color of state law" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983 when they disclosed respondent\'s personal information to state officials in connection with state-law teacher certification requirements. 143 Wash. 2d 687, 710-711, 24 P. 3d 390, 401-402 (2001). Although the petition for certiorari challenged this holding, we agreed to review only the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion, a question reserved in <i>Owasso Independent School Dist. No. 1-011 </i>v. <i>Falvo, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/426/case.html">534 U. S. 426</a>, 430431 (2002).

App. 338, 992 P. 2d 545 (2000). The Washington Supreme Court reversed that decision, and ordered the FERPA damages reinstated. 143 Wash. 2d 687, 24 P. 3d 390 (2001). The court acknowledged that "FERPA itself does not give rise to a private cause of action," but reasoned that FERPA\'s nondisclosure provision "gives rise to a federal right enforceable under section 1983." <i>Id., </i>at 707-708, 24 P. 3d, at 400.</p><p>Like the Washington Supreme Court and the State Court of Appeals below, other state and federal courts have divided on the question of FERPA\'s enforceability under \xc2\xa7 1983.2 The fact that all of these courts have relied on the same set of opinions from this Court suggests that our opinions in this area may not be models of clarity. We therefore granted certiorari, 534 U.

S. 418</a> (1987), we allowed a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit by tenants to recover past overcharges under a rent-ceiling provision of the Public Housing Act, on the ground that the provision unambiguously conferred "a mandatory [benefit] focusing on the individual family and its income." <i>Id., </i>at 430. The key to our inquiry was that Congress spoke in terms that "could not be clearer," <i>ibid., </i>and conferred entitlements "sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as enforceable rights under <i>Pennhurst."

In <i>Suter </i>v. <i>Artist M., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/347/case.html">503 U. S. 347</a> (1992), the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required States receiving funds for adoption assistance to have a "plan" to make "reasonable efforts" to keep children out of foster homes. A class of parents and children sought to enforce this requirement against state officials under \xc2\xa7 1983, claiming that no such efforts had been made. We read the Act "in the light shed by <i>Pennhurst," id., </i>at 358, and found no basis for the suit, saying:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Careful examination of the language ... does not unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the Act\'s beneficiaries. The term \'reasonable efforts\' in this context is at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather generalized duty on the State, to be enforced not by private individuals, but by the Secretary in the manner [of reducing or eliminating payments]." <i>Id., </i>at 363.</p></blockquote><p>Since the Act conferred no specific, individually enforceable rights, there was no basis for private enforcement, even by a class of the statute\'s principal beneficiaries. <i>Id., </i>at 357.</p><p>Similarly, in <i>Blessing </i>v. <i>Freestone, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/case.html">520 U.

Five Arizona mothers invoked \xc2\xa7 1983 against state officials on grounds that state child-welfare agencies consistently failed to meet these requirements. We found no basis for the suit, saying:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Far from creating an <i>individual </i>entitlement to services, the standard is simply a yardstick for the Secretary to measure the <i>systemwide </i>performance of a State\'s Title IV-D program.

He claims that a federal statute confers such rights so long as Congress intended that the statute "benefit" putative plaintiffs. Brief for Respondent 40-46. He further contends that a more "rigorous" inquiry would conflate the standard for inferring a private right of action under \xc2\xa7 1983 with the standard for inferring a private right of action directly from the statute itself, which he admits would not exist under FERPA. <i>Id., </i>at 41-43. As authority, respondent points to <i>Blessing </i>and <i>Wilder, </i>which, he says, used the term "benefit" to define the sort of statutory interest enforceable by \xc2\xa7 1983. See <i>Blessing, supra, </i>at 340-341 ("Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff"); <i>Wilder, supra, </i>at 509 (same).</p><p>Some language in our opinions might be read to suggest that something less than an unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \xc2\xa7 1983. <i>Blessing, </i>for example, set forth three "factors" to guide judicial inquiry into whether or not a statute confers a right: "Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff," "the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so \'vague and amorphous\' that its enforcement would strain judicial competence," and "the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms." 520 U.

In</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="283">283</a></p><p>the same paragraph, however, <i>Blessing </i>emphasizes that it is only violations of <i>rights, </i>not <i>laws, </i>which give rise to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions. <i>Id., </i>at 340. This confusion has led some courts to interpret <i>Blessing </i>as allowing plaintiffs to enforce a statute under \xc2\xa7 1983 so long as the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect; something less than what is required for a statute to create rights enforceable directly from the statute itself under an implied private right of action. Fueling this uncertainty is the notion that our implied private right of action cases have no bearing on the standards for discerning whether a statute creates rights enforceable by \xc2\xa7 1983. <i>Wilder </i>appears to support this notion, 496 U. S., at 508-509, n. 9, while <i>Suter, 503 </i>U. S., at 363-364, and <i>Pennhurst, </i>451 U. S., at 28, n. 21, appear to disavow it.</p><p>We now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under \xc2\xa7 1983. Section 1983 provides a remedy only for the deprivation of "rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States. Accordingly, it is <i>rights, </i>not the broader or vaguer "benefits" or "interests," that may be enforced under the authority of that section. This being so, we further reject the notion that our implied right of action cases are separate and distinct from our \xc2\xa7 1983 cases. To the contrary, our implied right of action cases should guide the determination of whether a statute confers rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p><p>We have recognized that whether a statutory violation may be enforced through \xc2\xa7 1983 "is a different inquiry than that involved in determining whether a private right of action can be implied from a particular statute." <i>Wilder, supra, </i>at 508, n. 9. But the inquiries overlap in one meaningful respect-in either case we must first determine whether Congress <i>intended to create a federal right. </i>Thus we have held that "[t]he question whether Congress ... intended to create a private right of action [is] definitively an-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="284">284</a></p><p>swered in the negative" where a "statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class." <i>Touche Ross </i>&amp; Co. v. <i>Redington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html">442 U. S. 560</a>, 576 (1979). For a statute to create such private rights, its text must be "phrased in terms of the persons benefited." <i>Cannon </i>v. <i>University of Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 692, n. 13 (1979). We have recognized, for example, that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 create individual rights because those statutes are phrased "with an <i>unmistakable focus </i>on the benefited class." <i>Id., </i>at 691 (emphasis added).3 But even where a statute is phrased in such explicit rights-creating terms, a plaintiff suing under an implied right of action still must show that the statute manifests an intent "to create not just a private <i>right </i>but also a private <i>remedy." Alexander </i>v. <i>Sandoval, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/case.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 286 (2001) (emphases added).</p><p>Plaintiffs suing under \xc2\xa7 1983 do not have the burden of showing an intent to create a private remedy because \xc2\xa7 1983 generally supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes. See <i>supra, </i>at 279-281. Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a statute confers an individual right, the right is presumptively enforceable by \xc2\xa7 1983.4 But</p><p>3 Title VI provides: <i>"No person </i>in the United States <i>shall ... </i>be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance" on the basis of race, color, or national origin. 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000d (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Title IX provides:</p><p><i>"No person </i>in the United States <i>shall, </i>on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1681(a) (emphasis added). Where a statute does not include this sort of explicit "right- or duty-creating language," we rarely impute to Congress an intent to create a private right of action. See <i>Cannon, </i>441 U. S., at 690, n. 13 (listing provisions); <i>Alexander </i>v. <i>Sandoval, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/case.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 288 (2001) (existence or absence of rights-creating language is critical to the Court\'s inquiry).</p><p>4 The State may rebut this presumption by showing that Congress "specifically foreclosed a remedy under \xc2\xa7 1983." <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U. S. 992</a>, 1004-1005, n. 9 (1984).

S. 287, 294 (1981). This makes obvious sense, since \xc2\xa7 1983 merely provides a mechanism for enforcing individual rights "secured" elsewhere, i. <i>e., </i>rights independently "secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States. "[O]ne cannot go into court and claim a \'violation of \xc2\xa7 1983\' -for \xc2\xa7 1983 by itself does not protect anyone against anything." <i>Chapman </i>v. <i>Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U. S. 600</a>, 617 (1979).</p><p>A court\'s role in discerning whether personal rights exist in the \xc2\xa7 1983 context should therefore not differ from its role in discerning whether personal rights exist in the implied right of action context. Compare <i>Golden State Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>Los Angeles, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html">493 U.

Both inquiries simply require a determination as to whether or not Congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries. Compare <i>Wright, </i>479 U.

Accordingly, where the text and structure of a statute provide no indication that Congress intends to create new individual rights, there is no basis for a private suit, whether under \xc2\xa7 1983 or under an implied right of action.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS disagrees with this conclusion principally because separation-of-powers concerns are, in his view, more pronounced in the implied right of action context as opposed to the \xc2\xa7 1983 context. <i>Post, </i>at 300-301 (dissenting opinion) (citing <i>Wilder, </i>496 U. S., at 509, n. 9). But we fail to see how relations between the branches are served by having courts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and choose which federal requirements may be enforced by \xc2\xa7 1983 and which may not. Nor are separation-of-powers concerns within the Federal Government the only guideposts in this sort of analysis. See <i>Will </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/58/case.html">491 U. S. 58</a>, 65 (1989) ("[I]f Congress intends to alter the \'usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,\' it must make its intention to do so \'unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\'" (quoting <i>Atascadero State Hospital </i>v. <i>Scanlon, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html">473 U.

JUSTICE STEVENS would conclude that Congress intended FERPA\'s nondisclosure provisions to confer individual rights on millions of school students from kindergarten through graduate school without having ever said so explicitly. This conclusion entails a judicial assumption, with no basis in statutory text, that Congress intended to set itself resolutely against a tradition of deference to state and local school officials, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Falvo, </i>534 U.

To begin with, the provisions entirely lack the sort of "rights-creating" language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights. <i>Alexander </i>v. <i>Sandoval, </i>532 U. S., at 288-289; <i>Cannon, </i>441 U. S., at 690, n. 13. Unlike the individually focused terminology of Titles VI and IX ("No person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination"), FERPA\'s provisions speak only to the Secretary of Education, directing that "[n]o funds shall be made available" to any "educational agency or institution" which has a prohibited "policy or practice." 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(1). This focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents and clearly does not confer the sort of <i>"individual </i>entitlement" that is enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983. <i>Blessing, </i>520 U. S., at 343 (emphasis in original). As we said in <i>Cannon:</i></p><blockquote><p>\n"There would be far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons if Congress, instead of drafting Title IX with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class, had written it simply as a ban on discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds or as a prohibition against the disbursement of public funds to educational institutions engaged in discriminatory practices." 441 U. S., at 690-693.</p></blockquote><p>See also <i>Alexander </i>v. <i>Sandoval, supra, </i>at 289 ("Statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create \'no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons\'" (quoting <i>California </i>v. <i>Sierra Club, supra, </i>at 294)).</p><p>interpretation of FERPA because "[w]e doubt Congress meant to intervene in this drastic fashion with traditional state functions"); <i>Regents of </i>Univ. of Mich. v. <i>Ewing, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/214/case.html">474 U.

See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(1)-(2) (prohibiting the funding of "any educational agency or institution which has a <i>policy or practice </i>of permitting the release of education records" (emphasis added)). Therefore, as in <i>Blessing, </i>they have an "aggregate" focus, 520 U. S., at 343, they are not concerned with "whether the needs of any particular person have been satisfied," <i>ibid., </i>and they cannot "give rise to individual rights," <i>id., </i>at 344. Recipient institutions can further avoid termination of funding so long as they "comply substantially" with the Act\'s requirements. \xc2\xa7 1234c(a). This, too, is not unlike <i>Blessing, </i>which found that Title IV -D failed to support a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit in part because it only required "substantial compliance" with federal regulations. 520 U. S., at 335, 343. Respondent directs our attention to subsection (b)(2), but the text and structure of subsections (b)(l) and (b)(2) are essentially the same.6 In each provision the reference to individual consent is in the context of describing the type of "policy or practice" that triggers a funding prohi-</p><p>6 Subsection (b)(2) provides in relevant part:</p><p>"No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of releasing, or providing access to, any personally identifiable information in education records other than directory information ... unless-</p><p>"(A) there is written consent from the student\'s parents specifying records to be released, the reasons for such release, and to whom, and with a copy of the records to be released to the student\'s parents and the student if desired by the parents." 20 U.

Congress expressly authorized the Secretary of Education to <i>"deal with violations" </i>of the Act, \xc2\xa7 1232g(f) (emphasis added), and required the Secretary to "establish or designate [a] review board" for investigating and adjudicating such violations, \xc2\xa7 1232g(g). Pursuant to these provisions, the Secretary created the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) "to act as the Review Board required under the Act [and] to enforce the Act with respect to all applicable programs." 34 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 99.60(a) and (b) (2001). The FPCO permits students and parents who suspect a violation of the Act to file individual written complaints. \xc2\xa7 99.63. If a complaint is timely and contains required information, the FPCO will initiate an investigation, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 99.64(a)-(b), notify the educational institution of the charge, \xc2\xa7 99.65(a), and request a written response, \xc2\xa7 99.65. If a violation is found, the FPCO distributes a notice of factual findings and a "statement of the specific steps that the agency or institution must take to comply" with FERPA. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 99.66(b) and (c)(l).

See <i>post, </i>at 293-294, 296.

S. 329</a>, 340-341 (1997); <i>Suter </i>v. <i>Artist M., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/347/case.html">503 U. S. 347</a>, 357 (1992); <i>Wilder </i>v. <i>Virginia Hospital Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html">496 U. S. 498</a>, 509-511 (1990); <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 </i>U. S. 418, 423-427 (1987). But the statute books are too many, the laws too diverse, and their purposes too complex, for any single legal formula to offer more than general guidance. I would not, in effect, predetermine an outcome through the use of a presumption-such as the majority\'s presumption that a right is conferred only if set forth "unambiguously" in the statute\'s "text and structure." See <i>ante, </i>at 280, 288.</p><p>At the same time, I do not believe that Congress intended private judicial enforcement of this statute\'s "school record privacy" provisions. The Court mentions most of the considerations I find persuasive: The phrasing of the relevant prohibition (stating that "[n]o funds shall be made available" to institutions with a "policy or practice" of permitting the release of "education records"), see <i>ante, </i>at 288, n. 6, 288289; the total absence (in the relevant statutory provision) of any reference to individual "rights" or the like, see <i>ante, </i>at 287; the related provisions that make clear, by creating administrative enforcement processes, that the Spending Clause was not simply a device to obtain federal jurisdiction,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="292">292</a></p><p>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment</p><p>see <i>ante, </i>at 289-290; and later statutory insistence upon centralized federal enforcement at the national, not the regional, level, see <i>ante, </i>at 290.</p><p>I would add one further reason. Much of the statute\'s key language is broad and nonspecific. The statute, for example, defines its key term, "education records," as (with certain enumerated exceptions) "those records, files, documents, and other materials which (i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational ... institution." 20 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g(a)(4)(A). This kind of language leaves schools uncertain as to just when they can, or cannot, reveal various kinds of information. It has led, or could lead, to legal claims that would limit, or forbid, such practices as peer grading, see <i>Owasso Independent School Dist. No. 1-011 </i>v. <i>Falvo, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/426/case.html">534 U. S. 426</a> (2002), teacher evaluations, see <i>Moore </i>v. <i>Hyche, </i>761 F. Supp. 112 (ND Ala. 1991), school "honor society" recommendations, see <i>Price </i>v. <i>Young, </i>580 F. Supp. 1 (ED Ark. 1983), or even roll call responses and "bad conduct" marks written down in class, see Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Falvo, supra, </i>O. T. 2001, No. 00-1073, pp. 37-38. And it is open to interpretations that invariably favor confidentiality almost irrespective of conflicting educational needs or the importance, or common sense, of limited disclosures in certain circumstances, say, where individuals are being considered for work with young children or other positions of trust.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Congress may well have wanted to make the agency remedy that it provided exclusive-both to achieve the expertise, uniformity, widespread consultation, and resulting administrative guidance that can accompany agency decisionmaking and to avoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the statute in a private action for damages. This factor, together with the others to which the majority refers, convinces me that Congress did not intend private judicial enforcement actions here.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="293">293</a></p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p><p>The Court\'s <i>ratio decidendi </i>in this case has a "now you see it, now you don\'t" character. At times, the Court seems to hold that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA or Act), 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g, simply does not create any federal rights, thereby disposing of the case with a negative answer to the question "whether Congress <i>in</i>tended to create a federal right," ante, at 283. This interpretation would explain the Court\'s studious avoidance of the rights-creating language in the title and the text of the Act. Alternatively, its opinion may be read as accepting the proposition that FERPA does indeed create both parental rights of access to student records and student rights of privacy in such records, but that those federal rights are of a lesser value because Congress did not intend them to be enforceable by their owners. See, <i>e. g., ante, </i>at 290 (requiring of respondent "no less and no more" than what is required of plaintiffs attempting to prove that a statute creates an implied right of action). I shall first explain why the statute does, indeed, create federal rights, and then explain why the Court\'s novel attempt to craft a new category of second-class statutory rights is misguided.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Title 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g, which embodies FERPA in its entirety, includes 10 subsections, which create rights for both students and their parents, and describe the procedures for enforcing and protecting those rights. Subsection (a)(l)(A) accords parents "the right to inspect and review the education records of their children." 1 Subsection (a)(l)(D) pro-</p><p>1 The following portions of 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1232g(a)(1)(A) and (B) identify the parents\' right. Mter stating that no funds shall be made available to an institution that has a policy of denying parents "the right to inspect and review the education records of their children," subsection (a)(l)(A) clarifies that if an education record pertains to more than one student, "the parents of one of such students shall have the right to inspect and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="294">294</a></p><p>vides that a "student or a person applying for admission" may waive "his right of access" to certain confidential statements. Two separate provisions protect students\' privacy rights: subsection (a)(2) refers to "the privacy rights of students," and subsection (c) protects "the rights of privacy of students and their families." And subsection (d) provides that after a student has attained the age of 18, "the rights accorded to the parents of the student" shall thereafter be extended to the student. Given such explicit rights-creating language, the title of the statute, which describes "family educational rights," is appropriate: The entire statutory scheme was designed to protect such rights.</p><p>Of course, as we have stated previously, a "blanket approach" to determining whether a statute creates rights enforceable under 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1994 ed., Supp. V) is inappropriate. <i>Blessing </i>v. <i>Freestone, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/case.html">520 U. S. 329</a>, 344 (1997). The precise statutory provision at issue in this case is \xc2\xa7 1232g(b).2 Although the rights-creating language in this subsection is not as explicit as it is in other parts of the statute, it is clear that, in substance, \xc2\xa7 1232g(b) formulates an individual right: in respondent\'s words, the "right of parents to withhold consent and prevent the unauthorized release of education record information by an educational</p><p>review only" the parts pertaining to that student. That subsection then provides that the educational institution "shall establish appropriate procedures" for the granting of parental requests for access within 45 days. <i>Ibid. </i>Subsection (a)(l)(B) also refers to the parents\' "right to inspect and review the education records" of their children.</p><p>2 In relevant part, \xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(2) states that "[n]o funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of releasing, or providing access to, any personally identifiable information in education records other than directory information ... unless" either "there is written consent from the student\'s parents specifying records to be released, the reasons for such release, and to whom, and with a copy of the records to be released to the student\'s parents and the student if desired by the parents," or a court order dictating release of information.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="295">295</a></p><p>institution ... that has a policy or practice of releasing such information." Brief for Respondent 11. This provision plainly meets the standards we articulated in <i>Blessing </i>for establishing a federal right: It is directed to the benefit of individual students and parents; the provision is binding on States, as it is "couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms"; and the right is far from" \'vague and amorphous,\'" 520 U. S., at 340-341. Indeed, the right at issue is more specific and clear than rights previously found enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983 in <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html">479 U. S. 418</a> (1987), and <i>Wilder </i>v. <i>Virginia Hospital Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/498/case.html">496 U. S. 498</a> (1990), both of which involved plaintiffs\' entitlement to "reasonable" amounts of money.3 As such, the federal right created by \xc2\xa7 1232g(b) is "presumptively enforceable by \xc2\xa7 1983," <i>ante, </i>at 284.</p><p>The Court claims that \xc2\xa7 1232g(b), because it references a "policy or practice," has an aggregate focus and thus cannot qualify as an individual right. See <i>ante, </i>at 288 (emphasis deleted). But \xc2\xa7 1232g(b) does not simply ban an institution from having a policy or practice-which would be a more systemic requirement. Rather, it permits a policy or practice of releasing information, <i>so long as </i>"there is written consent from the student\'s parents specifying records to be released, the reasons for such release, and to whom, and with a copy of the records to be released to the student\'s parents and the student if desired by the parents." 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g(b)(2)(A). The provision speaks of the individual "student," not students generally. In light of FERPA\'s stated purpose to "protect such individuals\' rights to privacy by limiting the transferability of their records without their consent," 120 Congo Rec. 39862 (1974) (statement of Sen.</p><p>3 In <i>Wright, </i>the right claimed was "that a \'reasonable\' amount for utilities be included in rent that a [public housing authority] was allowed to charge." 479 U. S., at 430. In <i>Wilder, </i>health care providers asserted the right to "reasonable and adequate rates" from "States participating in the Medicaid program." 496 U. S., at 512.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="296">296</a></p><p>Buckley), the individual focus of \xc2\xa7 1232g(b) is manifest. Moreover, simply because a "pattern or practice" is a precondition to individual relief does not mean that the right asserted is not an individually enforceable right. Cf. <i>Monell </i>v. <i>New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U. S. 658</a>, 690695 (1978) (authorizing municipal liability under \xc2\xa7 1983 when a municipality\'s "policy or custom" has caused the violation of an individual\'s federal rights).</p><p>Although \xc2\xa7 1232g(b) alone provides strong evidence that an individual federal right has been created, this conclusion is bolstered by viewing the provision in the overall context of FERPA. Not once in its opinion does the Court acknowledge the substantial number of references to "rights" in the FERPA provisions surrounding \xc2\xa7 1232g(b), even though our past \xc2\xa7 1983 cases have made clear that a given statutory provision\'s meaning is to be discerned "in light of the entire legislative enactment," <i>Suter </i>v. <i>Artist M., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/347/case.html">503 U. S. 347</a>, 357 (1992).4 Rather, ignoring these provisions, the Court asserts that FERPA-not just \xc2\xa7 1232g(b)-"entirely lack[s]" rights-creating language, <i>ante, </i>at 287. The Court also claims that "we have never before held ... that spending legislation drafted in terms resembling those of FERPA can confer enforceable rights." <i>Ante, </i>at 279. In making this claim, the Court contrasts FERPA\'s "[n]o funds shall be made available" language with "individually focused termi-</p><p>4 The Court correctly states that "rights" language alone does not necessarily create rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983, <i>ante, </i>at 289, n. 7 (quoting <i>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </i>v. <i>Halderman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U. S. 1</a> (1981)), but such language is certainly relevant to whether a statute creates rights, see <i>ante, </i>at 287 (describing "\'rights-creating\' language" as "critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights"). Moreover, in <i>Pennhurst, </i>the Court treated the "rights" language as the only arguable evidence that the statute created rights; here, the "\'overall\' or \'specific\' purposes of the Act," 451 U. S., at 18, also show an intent to create individual rights. See <i>supra, </i>at 295 and this page (discussing FERPA\'s "stated purpose").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="297">297</a></p><p>nology" characteristic of federal antidiscrimination statutes, such as "[n]o person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination," <i>ante, </i>at 287. But the sort of rights-creating language idealized by the Court has <i>never </i>been present in our \xc2\xa7 1983 cases; rather, such language ordinarily gives rise to an implied cause of action. See <i>Cannon </i>v. <i>University of Chicago, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 690, n. 13 (1979). None of our four most recent cases involving whether a Spending Clause statute created rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983- <i>Wright, Wilder, Suter, </i>and <i>Blessing-involved </i>the sort of "no person shall" rightscreating language envisioned by the Court. And in two of those cases-Wright and <i>Wilder-we </i>concluded that individual rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983 existed. See n. 3, <i>supra.</i></p><p>Although a "presumptively enforceable" right, <i>ante, </i>at 284, has been created by \xc2\xa7 1232g(b), one final question remains. As our cases recognize, Congress can rebut the presumption of enforcement under \xc2\xa7 1983 either "expressly, by forbidding recourse to \xc2\xa7 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement [actions]." <i>Blessing, 520 </i>U. S., at 341. FERPA has not explicitly foreclosed enforcement under \xc2\xa7 1983. The only question, then, is whether the administrative enforcement mechanisms provided by the statute are "comprehensive" and "incompatible" with \xc2\xa7 1983 actions. As the Court explains, <i>ante, </i>at 289, FERPA authorizes the establishment of an administrative enforcement framework, and the Secretary of Education has created the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) to "deal with violations" of the Act, 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1232g(f). FPCO accepts complaints from the public concerning alleged FERPA violations and, if it so chooses, may follow up on such a complaint by informing institutions of the steps they must take to comply with FERPA, see 34 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 99.63-99.67 (2001), and, in exceptional cases, by administrative adjudication against noncomplying institutions, see 20 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1234. These ad-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="298">298</a></p><p>ministrative avenues fall far short of what is necessary to overcome the presumption of enforceability. We have only found a comprehensive administrative scheme precluding enforceability under \xc2\xa7 1983 in two of our past <i>cases-Middlesex County Sewerage Authority </i>v. <i>National Sea Clammers Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a> (1981), and <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Robinson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U. S. 992</a> (1984). In <i>Sea Clammers, </i>the relevant statute not only had "unusually elaborate enforcement provisions," but it also permitted private citizens to bring enforcement actions in court. 453 U. S., at 13-14. In <i>Smith, </i>the statute at issue provided for "carefully tailored" administrative proceedings followed by federal judicial review. 468 U. S., at 1009. In contrast, FERPA provides no guaranteed access to a formal administrative proceeding or to federal judicial review; rather, it leaves to administrative discretion the decision whether to follow up on individual complaints. As we said in <i>Blessing, </i>520 U. S., at 348, the enforcement scheme here is "far more limited than those in <i>Sea Clammers </i>and <i>Smith," </i>and thus does not preclude enforcement under \xc2\xa7 1983.5</p><p>5The Court does not test FERPA\'s administrative scheme against the "comprehensive enforcement scheme," <i>Blessing, </i>520 U. S., at 341, standard for rebutting the presumptive enforceability of a federal right, <i>ante, </i>at 290, n. 8, because it concludes that there is no federal right to trigger this additional analysis. Yet, at the same time, the Court imports "enforcement scheme" considerations into the initial question whether the statute creates a presumptively enforceable right. See <i>ante, </i>at 289 ("Our conclusion that FERPA\'s nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enforceable rights is buttressed by the mechanism that Congress chose to provide for enforcing [FERPA violations]"). Folding such considerations into the rights question renders the rebuttal inquiry superfluous. Moreover, the Court\'s approach is inconsistent with our past cases, which have kept separate the inquiries whether there is a right and whether an enforcement scheme rebuts presumptive enforceability. Thus, the Court\'s discussion of the schemes in <i>Wright </i>v. <i>Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html">479 U. S. 418</a> (1987), and <i>Wilder </i>v. <i>Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 </i>U. S. 498 (1990), is inapposite, see <i>ante, </i>at 289-290, because neither of those cases considered the existence of an enforcement scheme relevant to whether a federal right had been created in the first instance.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="299">299</a></p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Since FERPA was enacted in 1974, all of the Federal Courts of Appeals expressly deciding the question have concluded that FERPA creates federal rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983.6 Nearly all other federal and state courts reaching the issue agree with these Circuits.7 Congress has not overruled these decisions by amending FERPA to expressly preclude recourse to \xc2\xa7 1983. And yet, the Court departs from over a quarter century of settled law in concluding that FERPA creates no enforceable rights.

See <i>ante, </i>at 283-286. By using these cases, the Court now appears to require a heightened showing from \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs: "[I]f Congress wishes to create new rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguous terms-no less and no more than what is required for Congress to create new rights enforceable under an implied private right of action." <i>Ante, </i>at 290.</p><p>A requirement that Congress intend a "right to support a cause of action," <i>ante, </i>at 283, as opposed to simply the creation of an individual federal right, makes sense in the implied right of action context.

S., at 509, n. 9. However, imposing the implied right of action framework upon the \xc2\xa7 1983 inquiry, see <i>ante, </i>at 283-286, is not necessary: The separationof-powers concerns present in the implied right of action context "are not present in a \xc2\xa7 1983 case," because Congress expressly authorized private suits in \xc2\xa7 1983 itself. <i>Wilder, </i>496 U.

What has never before been required is congressional intent specifically to make the right <i>enforceable under </i>\xc2\xa7 1983.

Contrary to the Court\'s suggestion, however, our implied right of action cases do not necessarily cleanly separate out the "right" question from the "cause of action" question.

S., at 691, and the "propriety of implication of a cause of action," <i>id., </i>at 690, n. 13. Because <i>Cannon </i>and other implied right of action cases do not clearly distinguish the questions of "right" and "cause of action," it is inappropriate to use these cases to determine whether a statute creates rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p><p>The Court, however, asserts that it has not imported the entire implied right of action inquiry into the \xc2\xa7 1983 context, explaining that while \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs share with implied right of action plaintiffs the burden of establishing a federal right, \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs "do not have the burden of showing an intent to create a private remedy because \xc2\xa7 1983 generally</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="302">302</a></p><p>supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes." <i>Ante, </i>at 284. If the Court has not adopted such a requirement in the \xc2\xa7 1983 context-which it purports not to have done-then there should be no difference between the Court\'s "new" approach to discerning a federal right in the \xc2\xa7 1983 context and the test we have "traditionally" used, as articulated in <i>Blessing: </i>whether Congress intended to benefit individual plaintiffs, whether the right asserted is not" \'vague and amorphous,\'" and whether Congress has placed a binding obligation on the State with respect to the right asserted. 520 U. S., at 340-341. Indeed, the Court\'s analysis, in part, closely tracks <i>Blessing\'s </i>factors, as it examines the statute\'s language, and the asserted right\'s individual versus systematic thrust. See <i>ante, </i>at 287-289.</p><p>The Court\'s opinion in other places, however, appears to require more of plaintiffs. By defining the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff\'s burden concerning "whether a statute confers any right at all," <i>ante, </i>at 285, as whether "Congress nonetheless intended private suits to be brought before thousands of federal- and state-court judges," <i>ante, </i>at 290, the Court has collapsed the ostensible two parts of the implied right of action test ("is there a right" and "is it enforceable") into one. As a result, and despite its statement to the contrary, <i>ante, </i>at 284, the Court seems to place the unwarranted "burden of showing an intent to create a private remedy," <i>ibid., </i>on \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs. Moreover, by circularly defining a right actionable under \xc2\xa7 1983 as, in essence, "a right which Congress intended to make enforceable," the Court has eroded-if not eviscerated-the long-established principle of presumptive enforceability of rights under \xc2\xa7 1983. Under this reading of the Court\'s opinion, a right under <i>Blessing </i>is second class compared to a right whose enforcement Congress has clearly intended. Creating such a hierarchy of rights is not only</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="303">303</a></p><p>novel, but it blurs the long-recognized distinction between rights and remedies. And it does nothing to clarify our \xc2\xa7 1983 jurisprudence.</p><p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
