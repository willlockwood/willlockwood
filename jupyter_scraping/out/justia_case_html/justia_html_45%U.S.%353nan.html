Mallett, 45 U.S. 4 How. 353 353 (1846)</h3><p><b>Foxcroft v. Mallett</b></p><p><b>45 U.S. (4 How.) 353</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Where a township of land was granted to a college upon condition (among others) that the grantees should give security that they would place a certain number of settlers on the land within a certain time, the duty of placing settlers remained as a permanent charge upon the land, unless counteracted by express agreements and special provisions between some of the subsequent grantees.</p>\n<p>The second grantee, to his deed to a third grantee for an undivided portion of the land, having "excepted and reserved certain lots," and conveyed the rest, "subject to the condition that the third grantee should perform his part of the settling duties in proportion," and also, "that from the portion conveyed a part should be taken, in the proportion which the part conveyed bore to the whole township," by this language limited the extent and nature of the grant.</p>\n<p>When this third grantee mortgaged his interest, the portion of land destined for settlers did not pass by the mortgage, but when this portion was afterwards located according to law, a title accrued to the settler, paramount to a title held under a foreclosure of the mortgage.</p>\n<p>Whether the clause in the original grant be construed as an exception or reservation, or as a condition, the result would be the same.  The title to the settlers\' lots did not vest in any of the persons through whom the grant passed, but remained as a charge upon the land, until the intentions of the legislature were carried out by an actual settlement.</p>\n<p>By appropriating these lots to settlers, no part of the security provided by the mortgage is withdrawn, because the mortgage itself must have contemplated such an arrangement.</p>\n<p>The mortgage being executed on the same day that the mortgagor received his title, and containing a reference to the deed to the mortgagor, both deeds may be considered parts of one transaction, and be construed together.</p>\n<p>A decision of a state court upon the construction of a deed, as to matters and language belonging to the common law and not to any local statute, although entitled to high respect, is not conclusive upon this Court.</p>\n<p>This was a writ of right sued out by David Mallett, an inhabitant of New Hampshire, demanding two lots of land situated in Lee, in the County of Penobscot, and State of Maine, being lots numbered eleven in the fourth range, and eleven in the fifth range, containing two hundred acres, more or less, in said Town of Lee.</p>\n<p>As an illustration of the chain of title, on the part of both plaintiff and defendant, the reporter has prepared the two following diagrams, showing the title as exhibited upon the trial by the plaintiff and defendant respectively. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 45 U.

Mallett.</p>\n<p>On 5 June, 1827, three several deeds were executed, and in order to enable himself to execute one of them, Ingersoll received the deed which had so long been kept as an escrow by the College, namely, the deed of 15 February, 1820, by which the College conveyed the entire township to Ingersoll.  Being now in possession of his deed,</p>\n<p>1. Ingersoll conveyed to Samuel T.

Mallett, being in possession of these two branches of the entire title, mortgaged one of them (namely, the one which he had just received from Ingersoll) to the College, to secure the payment of certain notes to the College.  As the whole case turned upon the construction of this mortgage, and what passed under it, the whole paper is inserted.</p>\n<p>"Know all men by these presents, that I, Samuel T.

MALLETT  [L. S.]"</p>\n<p>"Signed, sealed, and delivered in presence of NATH\'L INGERSOLL"</p>\n<p>On 6 February, 1828, Ingersoll conveyed to Mallett a certain piece or parcel of land situated in No. 3, in the County of Penobscot, being one-half of lot numbered eleven, in the fifth range, in common and undivided, being one of the settlers\' lots, the half of said lot containing fifty acres, said land being north of Bingham\'s Penobscot purchase in the County of Penobscot.</p>\n<p>On 16 April, 1828, a meeting of the proprietors was called, "To see what measures the said proprietors will adopt to divide and apportion said lands, and to act thereon as may be judged proper."  After sundry proceedings and adjournments, the meeting voted, on 1 July, "That the proprietors will proceed to divide and apportion the lands reserved to be set off as public lots," and a committee was appointed to perform this duty.  The report of the committee was adopted by the meeting.  After setting off nine hundred and sixty acres as "ministerial lands," and some other proceedings, it was voted,</p>\n<p>"To assign and set off twenty-seven lots as settlers\' lots -- namely, to Nathaniel Ingersoll, thirteen lots, which he has sold to settlers, and on which improvements have been made, as so much towards his share.  Also, to Samuel T. Mallett, fourteen lots, being lots which he has sold to settlers, as so much towards his share in said lands."</p>\n<p>Amongst the lots thus assigned to Mallett were lots No. 11 in range 4, and No. 11 in range 5, being the two lots in controversy in the present case.  The meeting then proceeded to make division by lot of the lands not reserved for public lands, and not reserved to be holden as tenants in common among the several proprietors, according to their several rights in said township, and not assigned to Nathaniel Ingersoll and Samuel T. Mallett.</p>\n<p>On 12 August, 1829, Samuel Mallett conveyed to David Mallett, the plaintiff below, the two lots in question.</p>\n<p>On 26 July, 1832, the notes to the College not being paid by Samuel Mallett, the College brought an action called a "plea of land," in the nature of an ejectment, to recover sixty-eight lots of one hundred acres each, which had been drawn to the share of said Mallett as above set forth, the action being for "six thousand acres in common and undivided."</p>\n<p>At June term, 1837, the case came on for trial, and was left to a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the judgment of the court was,</p>\n<p>"that the said President and Trustees of Williams College recover against the said Samuel T. Mallett their title and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 45 U. S. 362</a></p><p> possession of and in the demanded premises, and that a writ of possession issue accordingly, unless the defendant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns [pay] the sum of five thousand three hundred and five dollars and seventy-five cents, and interest, within two months, together with costs of suit, taxed at ninety-five dollars and thirteen cents."</p>\n<p>Upon this judgment a writ of <em>habere facias</em> possessionem was issued, on 20 June, 1839.</p>\n<p>Under this recovery, Foxcroft, the plaintiff in error and defendant below claimed.  It is unnecessary to set out the mesne conveyances and partition by which his title to the lots in question was established.</p>\n<p>The suit brought by David Mallett in the circuit court was a writ of right, which came on for trial in October, 1843, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.  The following bill of exceptions to a ruling of the court was taken on the part of Foxcroft, the defendant.</p>\n<p>"DAVID MALLETT v. JOSEPH E. FOXCROFT."</p>\n<p>"Be it remembered, that the aforesaid Mallett having, on the twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, brought his writ of right, returnable to said circuit court, to be holden on the first day of October, then next, wherein the said David demands against the said Joseph two certain lots of land, with the appurtenances, situate in Lee, in said Maine district, being lots numbered eleven in the fourth range, and eleven in the fifth range, in said town of Lee; which two certain lots the said David claims to be the right and inheritance of him, the said David, and of which he alleges that he was seized in his demesne as of fee and right, within twenty years, and ought now to be in quiet possession thereof, but which the said Joseph unjustly withholds from him.  And the said writ having been duly served and returned, when and where the same was returnable, and the action having been duly entered and continued, from term to term, to this term, and the said Joseph having appeared and pleaded, and thereby defended the right of the said David and his seizin, and put himself thereof on the country, and prayed recognition to be made whether he, the said Joseph, had not greater right to hold the tenements aforesaid, to him and his heirs, as tenants thereof, as he now holds the same, or the said David, as he has demanded the same in and by his said writ and declaration, and the plaintiff having joined the issue tendered, and the jury having been duly empanelled to try the same, the plaintiff, to prove the issue on his part, offered in evidence a deed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to Williams College, dated February 15, 1820, of a certain township of land, of which the demanded premises are a part, a copy of which deed is hereunto annexed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 45 U.

Portions of the record, so far as they relate to the matter in controversy, were read; a copy of which, marked B, is hereunto annexed, and makes a part of this bill of exceptions.  He also offered in evidence and read to the jury, a deed from said Samuel T.

Also a deed from said Williams College to John Webber, dated May 11, 1835, assigning said mortgaged premises to him.  Also a deed from John Webber to said defendant, dated 19 June, 1835, conveying one undivided half of said mortgaged premises to him, said defendant, copies of which two last-mentioned deeds are annexed, and make a part of this bill of exceptions, marked No. 7 and 8.  Also the proceedings in partition, instituted by the said Webber and Foxcroft, and the record of the assignment and judgment thereon, in the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine, being the highest court of record in said state, a copy of which proceedings and record is annexed, marked No. 9, makes a part of this bill of exceptions.

The title to the settlers\' lots did not vest in any of the persons through whom the grant passed, but remained as a charge upon the land, until the intentions of the legislature were carried out by an actual settlement.</p>\n<p>By appropriating these lots to settlers, no part of the security provided by the mortgage is withdrawn, because the mortgage itself must have contemplated such an arrangement.</p>\n<p>The mortgage being executed on the same day that the mortgagor received his title, and containing a reference to the deed to the mortgagor, both deeds may be considered parts of one transaction, and be construed together.</p>\n<p>A decision of a state court upon the construction of a deed, as to matters and language belonging to the common law and not to any local statute, although entitled to high respect, is not conclusive upon this Court.</p>\n<p>This was a writ of right sued out by David Mallett, an inhabitant of New Hampshire, demanding two lots of land situated in Lee, in the County of Penobscot, and State of Maine, being lots numbered eleven in the fourth range, and eleven in the fifth range, containing two hundred acres, more or less, in said Town of Lee.</p>\n<p>As an illustration of the chain of title, on the part of both plaintiff and defendant, the reporter has prepared the two following diagrams, showing the title as exhibited upon the trial by the plaintiff and defendant respectively. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 45 U.

Mallett, being in possession of these two branches of the entire title, mortgaged one of them (namely, the one which he had just received from Ingersoll) to the College, to secure the payment of certain notes to the College.

After sundry proceedings and adjournments, the meeting voted, on 1 July, "That the proprietors will proceed to divide and apportion the lands reserved to be set off as public lots," and a committee was appointed to perform this duty.  The report of the committee was adopted by the meeting.  After setting off nine hundred and sixty acres as "ministerial lands," and some other proceedings, it was voted,</p>\n<p>"To assign and set off twenty-seven lots as settlers\' lots -- namely, to Nathaniel Ingersoll, thirteen lots, which he has sold to settlers, and on which improvements have been made, as so much towards his share.  Also, to Samuel T. Mallett, fourteen lots, being lots which he has sold to settlers, as so much towards his share in said lands."</p>\n<p>Amongst the lots thus assigned to Mallett were lots No. 11 in range 4, and No. 11 in range 5, being the two lots in controversy in the present case.  The meeting then proceeded to make division by lot of the lands not reserved for public lands, and not reserved to be holden as tenants in common among the several proprietors, according to their several rights in said township, and not assigned to Nathaniel Ingersoll and Samuel T. Mallett.</p>\n<p>On 12 August, 1829, Samuel Mallett conveyed to David Mallett, the plaintiff below, the two lots in question.</p>\n<p>On 26 July, 1832, the notes to the College not being paid by Samuel Mallett, the College brought an action called a "plea of land," in the nature of an ejectment, to recover sixty-eight lots of one hundred acres each, which had been drawn to the share of said Mallett as above set forth, the action being for "six thousand acres in common and undivided."</p>\n<p>At June term, 1837, the case came on for trial, and was left to a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the judgment of the court was,</p>\n<p>"that the said President and Trustees of Williams College recover against the said Samuel T. Mallett their title and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 45 U. S. 362</a></p><p> possession of and in the demanded premises, and that a writ of possession issue accordingly, unless the defendant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns [pay] the sum of five thousand three hundred and five dollars and seventy-five cents, and interest, within two months, together with costs of suit, taxed at ninety-five dollars and thirteen cents."</p>\n<p>Upon this judgment a writ of <em>habere facias</em> possessionem was issued, on 20 June, 1839.</p>\n<p>Under this recovery, Foxcroft, the plaintiff in error and defendant below claimed.  It is unnecessary to set out the mesne conveyances and partition by which his title to the lots in question was established.</p>\n<p>The suit brought by David Mallett in the circuit court was a writ of right, which came on for trial in October, 1843, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.  The following bill of exceptions to a ruling of the court was taken on the part of Foxcroft, the defendant.</p>\n<p>"DAVID MALLETT v. JOSEPH E.

JUSTICE WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a writ of error, founded on an exception taken to the ruling of the circuit court, in the Maine District, as to the construction of a deed.</p>\n<p>The action below was brought to recover lots No. 11 in the 4th range, and No. 11 in the 5th range, in the town of Lee, in said district, and the construction objected to was that a mortgage, executed June 5, 1827, by Samuel Mallett to Williams College, under which institution the plaintiff in error claims, did not comprehend or convey the demanded premises.</p>\n<p>In order to judge of the correctness of this construction, and its bearing on the rights of the parties, it will be necessary to examine the circumstances under which the deed was made, as well as its phraseology.</p>\n<p>The demanded premises were part of township No. 3, north of Bingham\'s Penobscot purchase, conveyed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to Williams College, 15 February, 1820, under certain resolves, passed by the legislature, February 19, 1805, and January 27, 1820.  The only conditions in those resolves material to what is now under consideration were, that "the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 45 U. S. 371</a></p><p> grantees, or their assigns," shall give security that they,</p>\n<p>"within three years, will place on said township thirty families, as settlers, of the description named in the act for promoting the sale and settlement of the public lands in the District of Maine; also reserving in said township the usual public lots."</p>\n<p>By the act referred to, for "promoting the sale and settlement of the public lands in the District of Maine," it was provided (in section sixth),</p>\n<p>"That in every township to be laid out pursuant to this act, the commissioners shall set apart fifty lots, of one hundred acres each, of average quality and value, no two lots of which shall be contiguous to each other, which shall be granted and conveyed to the first fifty settlers in said township, upon the payment of five dollars for each lot."</p>\n<p>Statute, February 15, 1816, 172.  The fifth section authorized the commissioners to take a commutation from grantees of any settling duties they were held to perform.</p>\n<p>The resolve, granting this township, reduced the number of settlers from fifty to thirty, and, instead of reserving the right to the commissioners to execute such deeds, provided, that the grantees might give security to the state to do it, and perform the other duties, as to the settlers, under the before-mentioned act.  Accordingly, Williams College having conveyed this township to Nathaniel Ingersoll, on 15 February, 1820, and not having given the before-mentioned security themselves, procured him to do it, and he, by bond, dated March 17, 1820, stipulated with the state, among other things, to place, within three years,</p>\n<p>"on said township thirty families, as settlers, of the description named in the act for promoting the sale and settlement of the public lands in the District of Maine."</p>\n<p>Matters being thus situated, Ingersoll, on 5 June, 1827, conveyed to Samuel T. Mallett a portion of said township, under the following description, reservations, and conditions:</p>\n<p>"Six thousand acres of land, in common and undivided, in the township of land lying in the County of Penobscot, as the same township was surveyed by Alexander Greenwood, Esq., in the year one thousand eight hundred and eleven, the same being township numbered three in the second range of townships north of the Bingham Penobscot purchase, and numbered four by said Greenwood, being the same conveyed to me by the President and Trustees of Williams College, as described in their deed, dated February fifteenth, one thousand eight hundred and twenty, and this day delivered to me, reference thereto being had; excepting and reserving the lots marked as settlers\' lots on a plan of said town, made by John Webber, and excepting also the lot on which I have improved, which are not to be subjected to a draft; subject, however, to the condition that the said Mallett shall perform his part of the settling duties in proportion to the land conveyed, and also that from said six thousand acres a part of the public lands reserved shall be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 45 U. S. 372</a></p><p> taken, in proportion as said six thousand acres bears to the whole township."</p>\n<p>On the same day, to secure the consideration for the purchase, and to pay the same to Williams College, in behalf of said Ingersoll, still indebted to the College, Mallett conveyed the same premises, by mortgage, to the College, under the following description:</p>\n<p>"Six thousand acres of land, in common and undivided, in the township of land lying in the County of Penobscot, as the same township was surveyed by Alexander Greenwood, 1811, the same being township number three in the second range north of the Bingham Penobscot purchase, and numbered four by said Greenwood, being the same this day conveyed to me by Nathaniel Ingersoll, as by his deed, reference thereto being had."</p>\n<p>What passed by this conveyance is the chief difficulty in the case.  The question arises in this way.</p>\n<p>The debt, secured by that mortgage, not being paid, the College instituted a suit to foreclose the same, in the year 1832, and recovered judgment June 20, 1839.  In the meantime, namely, May 11, 1835, it transferred the rights under the mortgage to John Webber, who, in June of the same year, conveyed a moiety of them to Foxcroft, the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p>Webber and Foxcroft then, in July, 1836, petitioned the Superior Court of Maine for a partition of what they held in common with others; and, after various proceedings, these lots, No. 11 in the 4th, and No. 11 in the 5th range, were set off to them in severalty; and on 4 November, 1836, Webber released all his rights in them to Foxcroft.  This, it is contended, vested the title in him, derived under the mortgage; and it might have done so, in one view of the case, had nothing else occurred to prevent or defeat it.  But Samuel Mallett, after the conveyance to him by Ingersoll, and the mortgage to the College, proceeded to put on the land various settlers, under the reservations and conditions in the deed to him; and, at a meeting of the proprietors of the township, for the purpose of dividing the same, April 16, 1828, No. 11 in the 4th range, and No. 11 in the 5th, were set off to Samuel Mallett, with other lots, making fourteen in all, and described as "being lots which he has sold to settlers, as so much towards his share in said lands," and on 12 August, 1829, he executed a deed of those lots to the demandant.</p>\n<p>The case, then, stands thus.  If the title to these lots passed under the mortgage from Samuel Mallett to the College without condition, except as security for the debt, the plaintiff in error is now possessed of them in severalty, and should retain them.  But if the title to them did not pass at all by that mortgage, on account of the exceptions or reservations either in it or the prior deed, which are applicable to the premises, or if it passed on conditions which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 45 U. S. 373</a></p><p> have since vested these lots in David Mallett, as settlers\' lots under the act to encourage the sale and settlement of lands in Maine -- then he, as settler and grantee of the same, ought now of right to possess them.  The general aspect of the whole case is, we think, strongly in favor of the right set up by the demandant.</p>\n<p>On the construction made in his favor by the court below, he will recover only what the laws of the state intended such settlers as he should have, and which it was expressly provided they should have in the deed from Ingersoll to Samuel Mallett of the tract including these premises.</p>\n<p>But should the opposite construction, contended for by the tenant, prevail, the College and its assignees will get back, under a mortgage to secure a part of the consideration, about one-fourth of the township, free from any charge or deduction on account of settlers\' claims, when the College was originally entitled to it under the resolve only as burdened with that charge, and has paid nothing since to relieve the land from it; and when the immediate grantee of the College conveyed it so burdened, and has done nothing since to remove the encumbrance.  Again, it was a leading principle of public policy with the state, in order to increase its population and wealth, that settlers should be placed upon the land at an early day, and, as an inducement for them to come, should have lots for a very small consideration.  The College took the original grant under stipulations to effect this, and were bound to effect it, to the number of thirty families.</p>\n<p>Yet, on the construction set up by the tenant, Ingersoll, under his bond, and his assigns, under the clauses in their deeds from him, would be compelled to effect this so far as regards one-fourth of the town, without allowing them any consideration therefor, or permitting them to make it a permanent charge on the land itself, as it originally was and would naturally continue to be.</p>\n<p>But general considerations like these may be counteracted by express agreements and special provisions between the parties, and it is necessary to ascertain next whether any such different and opposing agreements have been entered into here.  When Ingersoll, being the second grantee and the obligor in the bond to the state for the performance of duties as to settlers, proceeded to convey about one-fourth of the township to Samuel Mallett, it is clear that he preferred making the performance of the duties to settlers in that portion of the township a charge on the land itself, by a condition in the grant, as had formerly been the usage, rather than taking another bond or other collateral security for it to himself.  Such a course was also likely to be the safest, and was competent or legal, if he chose to adopt it.  Accordingly, at the close of the description of the premises, in his deed to Mallett, he adds, "excepting and reserving the lots marked," &amp;c., which are not those now in dispute, and concludes -- "subject, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 45 U. S. 374</a></p><p> to the CONDITION, that the said Mallett shall perform his part of the settling duties in proportion to the land conveyed, and also, that from said six thousand acres a part of the public lands reserved <em>shall be taken,</em> in proportion as said six thousand acres bears to the whole township."  There can be no doubt, that this language, whether following or preceding the description of the premises, was intended to constitute an integral part of the deed itself, and to limit the extent and nature of the grant.  A condition or reservation may be inserted in any part of a deed.  Shepherd\'s Touch., ch. 6; 5 D. &amp; E. 526; 1 Saund. 60, note.</p>\n<p>Nor is such a provision inconsistent with the general covenants, as has been contended by the plaintiff in error.  They must be construed as relating only to the subject matter, looking to the whole deed, and the obvious intent of the parties in the whole.</p>\n<p>What, then, is the effect of these particular clauses?  Clearly to except out of and reserve from passing at all, by the grant, so much of the six thousand acres as "the lots marked as settlers\' lots on a plan of said town by J. Webber," and also the lot on which Ingersoll had improved.  These were not to be considered as held in common or "subjected to a draft," but were entirely excluded from any future division of the six thousand acres.  These, however, are not now in controversy.</p>\n<p>What more do these clauses provide?  The whole land, which did pass under the grant, was to be held "subject" <em>"to the condition, that the said Mallett shall perform his part of the settling duties,"</em> or, in other words, put on his proportionate number of families, and convey to the head of each a hundred-acre lot for only five dollars, and also allow a proportionate share of the public lands reserved in said township to <em>"be taken"</em> from this six thousand acres.   This is the important provision bearing on the present case.  For aught which appears, the settlers had not then removed upon the land.  The public lots reserved in the township had not then been set apart.  But the parties virtually agreed that when settlers were put on and when the public lots were set apart, one-fourth, or thereabouts, of the lands in the whole town belonging to settlers should, on the payment of a mere nominal consideration, come out of these six thousand acres, and, in like manner, one-fourth of the public lots should be taken therefrom.</p>\n<p>This being the special agreement of the parties, the next inquiry is, has it been carried into effect in a manner so as legally to sustain the judgment rendered below?</p>\n<p>The controverted expressions in the deed seem, in their most obvious import, either to except from the land conveyed the lots which settlers should select, or to make it a condition of the grant, that the title to those lots should afterwards be vested in them.  The form of the ruling of the court leaves it a little uncertain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 45 U. S. 375</a></p><p> on which of these grounds the opinion rested, as, after a recital of the evidence in the case, the bill of exceptions says:</p>\n<p>"Upon this evidence the honorable justice who presided at said trial ruled that the mortgage deed offered in evidence by the defendant, given to the said Trustees of Williams College, dated 5 June, 1827, marked 5, does not comprehend and cover the two lots, 11th in the 4th range, and 11th in the 5th range, being the premises demanded."</p>\n<p>At the first blush it might be inferred that the judge held these lots did not pass at all under the mortgage, having been considered as excepted or reserved.  <em>Mallett v. Foxcroft,</em> 1 Story 477.  But we are inclined to think that so stringent a view of his ruling is not indispensably necessary, and if it were, we see no reason why the judgment is not to be sustained as right in substance and according to the merits of the case if, at the time the writ of right was brought, the title to these lots was not in the mortgagee or his grantees, but was rather in the demandant, under one of the views or constructions before mentioned.</p>\n<p>The learned judge might well mean that the mortgage "does not comprehend and cover the two lots" in dispute, as matters stood, after the settling, partition, and conveyance to David Mallett, and he would thus regard the provision as a condition which had been executed.  This would be free from much difficulty.  On the contrary, it is supposed by the plaintiff that he regarded it as an exception or reservation of the last lots.  This would be in the spirit and intent of the parties, as the former clause had been, an <em>excepting</em> or <em>reserving</em> of the first-named lots.  If deciding so, 1 Story 477, he doubtless considered that the last lots would ere long be set apart and marked, and thus become certain on the principles contained in the deed and in the statutes as to settlers and partitions by the proprietors of towns, and he therefore may have felt justified in regarding now as sufficiently certain what could be afterwards made certain, <em>id certum est quod certum reddi potest, Jackson v. Lawrence,</em> 11 Johns. 191.  But in some respects it is not quite so natural or safe a view to regard this last clause as a reservation or exception, nor does the judge call it so in the ruling.  An exception or reservation is sometimes void for uncertainty and sometimes for being in favor of third persons.  4 East 464; <em>Thompson v. Gregory,</em> 4 Johns. 81; 9 Johns. 73; Co.Litt. 143<em>a</em>.</p>\n<p>Those objections have been urged in this case; and it may, therefore, be least exceptionable to regard the last clause, as it is called in the deed, a condition.  <em>Rice v. Osgood,</em> 9 Mass. 43; <em>Gray v. Blanchard,</em> 8 Pick. 284.  This view seems well sustained both by the language used and the nature of the transaction.  The preceding clause is in words, <em>eo nomine,</em> excepting or reserving, while this is <em>eo nomine</em> on <em>"condition,"</em> and the lots </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 45 U. S. 376</a></p><p> there referred to were previously set apart, marked, and identified, while these were not so set apart, but still held in common and in some degree uncertain.  The phraseology was also changed in the last clause from "excepting and reserving" to <em>"condition,"</em> probably because the latter expression was deemed more appropriate as to lots not then selected or identified, but which were intended and virtually agreed to be, afterwards.</p>\n<p>Such an agreement would in its spirit, no less than words, be a condition, as it would be "a bridle" or restraint on the grant, which is one of Shepherd\'s definitions of a condition.  Shep.Touch., ch. 6.</p>\n<p>The nature of a transaction, as well as the language, may well be regarded always in deciding whether a case is a reservation or a condition.  13 Maine 31; 15 Maine 216; 4 Johns. 82; 1 D. &amp; E. 645; Shep.Touch., ch. 6, 122; 12 Pick. 156.</p>\n<p>A charge like this, imposed in a deed by the state, though using words of reservation, was adjudged to be a condition in <em>Hovey v. Deane,</em> 13 Me. 31; and same case, 15 <em>ibid.</em> 216; <em>Dunlap v. Stetson,</em> 4 Mason 349.  So a provision may be inserted in an instrument as to land, which will be construed either a condition or a covenant, as seems most appropriate.  Bac.Abr. <em>Condition,</em> G.  And words of limitation may be taken for a condition.  Com.Dig.<em> Condition,</em> A; 11 Mod. 61.</p>\n<p>But whichever the last clause should be considered as operating, consistent with legal principles, the result on the interests of the parties would be much the same.  In the former view, as an exception or reservation, the land afterwards set apart for these lots would be regarded as never passing at all to the mortgagee or his grantees, while in the latter view, as a condition, it would pass, but only on condition of being vested in the settlers, so soon as set apart and conveyed to them, and as the latter has already been done, the title would not be now in the tenant, under either of these views.</p>\n<p>Were it necessary to give validity to the clause, and it would be bad either as a reservation, exception, or condition, it would be no unusual stretch of construction to consider it as a covenant to stand seized to the use of the settlers, and in this way reach a like result.  <em>Jackson v. Swart,</em> 20 Johns. 87; <em>Bedel\'s Case,</em> 7 Coke 40.</p>\n<p>A deed is, if possible, to be made operative in some way, and the construction should be liberal, in order to effect that object, and enforce the original design.  2 Wils. 75; Willes 682; 5 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 106; 2 Saund. 96, note; Preston on Conveyancing, 41; Broom\'s Legal Maxims 238, 239.</p>\n<p>Making these important clauses, then, in the deed from Ingersoll, operative, and near as may be in conformity to the original design, which was both legal and laudable, why should they not bind subsequent mortgagees and grantees?</p>\n<p>Samuel Mallett, having obtained no interest in the six thousand </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 45 U. S. 377</a></p><p> acres, so far as regards the lots then marked and reserved, and none whatever in the whole tract, free from the condition and charge we have been describing -- of other lots to be afterwards marked and assigned, as these have been, to settlers -- how could he pass to others, by a mortgage, a greater interest than he obtained?</p>\n<p>That condition or charge was on the land, as an encumbrance, by the very terms of the deed to him, and he could not, if he tried, convey a title to the land which should be free from it.  Such a condition attaches to the land wherever it goes, "although the same pass through the hands of a hundred men" Shep.Touch., ch. 6; Perkins, \xc2\xa7 818; 2 Preston on Conveyancing 412; 1 Co.Litt. 230<em>b</em>.  In our view, it operates like a covenant which runs with the land, and all assignees are bound by covenants real that run with the land.  <em>Spencer\'s Case,</em> 5 Coke 15-17; Co.Litt. 47<em>a</em>; Shep.Touch. 161, ch. 6, 176; Com.Dig. Condition; 3 D. &amp; E. 393; 1 Paige\'s 412, 455.</p>\n<p>The condition, or charge, was also public -- on record, <em>in extenso,</em> in the deed from Ingersoll.  That deed was expressly referred to in the mortgage to the College, and the value of the whole, in Samuel Mallett\'s hands or in those of his mortgagees, would be known by all to be at that time reduced in proportion.</p>\n<p>By proceeding afterwards to get the partition made by the proprietors and to execute the deed to David Mallett, so as to perform his duty in respect to this condition, he did not, as seems to be contended, reduce further the value of the land to himself or mortgagees or part with any portion of it not before subject to be thus taken.</p>\n<p>The extent and nature of his title being spread upon record, nobody could be misled and nothing could pass by his mortgage, free from the same conditions and reservations under which it had come to him, and whenever certain lots should afterwards be set apart and conveyed to settlers -- it being in conformity with the condition -- they could not and ought not longer to be held or retained under the mortgage deed.  Nor is the subsequent setting apart of the premises and the conveyance of them to settlers a withdrawal of any part of the mortgaged security, as is argued by the plaintiff in error, because that security embraced the six thousand acres only as subject to such an event, and its happening was provided for, and was an open and express condition of the title to the property which was held as security.</p>\n<p>It is likewise urged by the plaintiff in error that Mallett might, like Ingersoll, have agreed to perform the duties towards settlers in money.  But he did not.  So, without any agreement, he might have done it with money and not left it to become an actual charge on the land in his mortgage, though placed as a conditional charge on it by Ingersoll.  But he did not.  So it is said the condition here is a subsequent one, and the title vests, subject to be divested </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 45 U. S. 378</a></p><p> only by a breach and an entry for condition broken, and which entry has never been made.  <em>Rice v. Osgood,</em> 9 Mass. 38; 2 Cruise, title 13, \xc2\xa7 15.</p>\n<p>But it has not been broken, and hence no entry by Ingersoll or others is necessary for condition broken.  On the contrary, the condition has been fulfilled by a performance of the duty to the settlers in getting their lots set apart and conveyed to them, and thus the title to those lots is vested in them now, as the condition prescribed, rather than remaining in the grantee or mortgagee.  <em>Rice v. Osgood,</em> 9 Mass. 44.</p>\n<p>There is no difficulty, then, about a breach and an entry, as everything has been fulfilled in the manner it ought to have been done.  So in answer to another objection it is clear that this fulfillment was attended to as properly by the mortgagor before a foreclosure as by the mortgagee.  18 Mass. 87; <em>Bradley v. Fuller,</em> 23 Pick. 9; 2 Greenleaf 132.  The mortgagor was in charge of the land, and was still the owner, for all purposes except the security of the creditor.  That security is not lessened by what he did in this respect.</p>\n<p>Another point has been much argued in relation to the mortgage which, in this view of the subject, is not material.  It is that the mortgage deed does not contain the condition.  After describing the premises, it is true that it does not go into details as to the several exceptions, reservations, and conditions in the deed to Samuel Mallett, but merely adds, "being the same this day conveyed to me by Nath\'l Ingersoll, as by his deed, reference thereto being had."  This reference, it is contended, is not broad enough to include or cover the exceptions and conditions.  But it could not be considered a forced construction to hold that the whole of the deed referred to should be regarded and considered as showing he intended to reconvey for security all, and no more or less, in any view, than what had just been conveyed to him.  <em>Field v. Huston,</em> 21 Me. 69, 72; 22 <em>ibid.</em> 327; <em>Foss v. Crisp,</em> 20 Pick. 121.  The reference to the deed might as properly be considered to indicate the interests as the premises just received.  In either view, the lots reserved would be reached, as they were connected not only with the title but the quantity of land meant to be conveyed.  So as to any charges in the form of a condition imposed on the land, they would be embraced, even under a reference to the premises, as those charges are contained in the same sentence, and tend to show a diminished quantity of land passing absolutely.</p>\n<p>Both deeds were also parts of one transaction, and may well be construed together as having a like object in respect to the extent of the interests no less than the premises.  But was the conclusion different, the case would, in the view first taken by us and which is the legal view, be merely that of a grantor undertaking to sell or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 45 U. S. 379</a></p><p> mortgage a larger interest than he possessed, or an interest unencumbered, which was in fact encumbered; and the remedy for such an excess in the conveyance is an action on the covenants, and not to construe the deed as granting more than the grantor himself possessed.</p>\n<p>There have been some other questions raised in the argument of this case, which it is not material to consider under the only ruling at the trial which is excepted to, and which relates entirely to what passed by the mortgage.</p>\n<p>One of them is the effect of a former recovery by Foxcroft and Webber against Mallett, in the proceedings for a partition, where the title of the latter to the lots now in controversy was questioned and tried, but this, being a writ of right, is probably not barred by any prior recoveries between these parties.  <em>Mallett v. Foxcroft,</em> 1 Story 477.  Another of these questions is the correctness of the partition made by the proprietors of this township, when the two lots in controversy were set off to Samuel Mallett.  Such a partition, however, though the ruling on it is not excepted to in the record, is supposed to be valid under the statutes of Maine and the usages that have long prevailed in New England among land proprietors of townships situated there.  Smith\'s Laws of Maine 175; 3 Shepley 401; 12 Pick. 534; 3 Fairfield 398; 10 Mass. 146; 3 Pick. 396; 12 Mass. 415; 2 Greenleaf 213; 4 N.H. 99; 3 Vt. 290; 6 Vt. 208.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, it has been urged against the judgment we have formed in favor of the right of the demandant that several actions have been tried in Maine, where his interests have been brought in question as to the premises and decisions had against him, and that such local adjudications in respect to the titles to real estate should control the opinions of this Court.   <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/13/87/case.html">13 U.
