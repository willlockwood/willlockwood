He also sought the Town\xe2\x80\x99s approval of his development plan.  About a decade later, he filed this suit in New York state court, claiming that the Town had obstructed his plans for the subdivision, forcing him to spend around $5.5 million to comply with its demands and driving him to the brink of personal bankruptcy.  Sherman asserted, among other claims, a regulatory takings claim under the Fifth and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.  The Town removed the case to a Federal District Court, which dismissed the takings claim as unripe.  The Second Circuit reversed that determination and remanded for the case to go forward.  On remand, real estate development company Laroe Estates, Inc. (respondent here), filed a motion to intervene of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), which requires a court to permit intervention by a litigant that \xe2\x80\x9cclaims an interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Laroe alleged that it had paid Sherman more than $2.5 million in relation to the development project and the subject property, that its resulting equitable interest in the property would be impaired if it could not intervene, and that Sherman would not adequately represent its interest.  Laroe filed, <i>inter alia,</i> an intervenor\xe2\x80\x99s complaint asserting a regulatory takings claim that was substantively identical to Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s and seeking a judgment awarding Laroe compensation for the taking of Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the property at issue.  The District Court denied Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s motion to intervene, concluding that its equitable interest did not confer standing.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that an intervenor of right is not required to meet Article III\xe2\x80\x99s standing requirements.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0A litigant seeking to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(2) must meet the requirements of Article III standing if the intervenor wishes to pursue relief not requested by a plaintiff.  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff seeking compensatory relief must have \xe2\x80\x9c(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Spokeo, Inc.</i> v. <i>Robins</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.

The same principle applies when there are multiple plaintiffs: At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.  That principle also applies to intervenors of right: For all relief sought, there must be a litigant with standing, whether that litigant joins the lawsuit as a plaintiff, a coplaintiff, or an intervenor of right.  Thus, at the least, an intervenor of right must demonstrate Article III standing when it seeks additional relief beyond that requested by the plaintiff.

(the respondent here) filed a motion to intervene of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).  This Rule requires a court to permit intervention by a litigant that \xe2\x80\x9cclaims an interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Laroe alleged that in 2003 it had entered into an agreement with Sherman regarding the MareBrook property.  Under this agreement, Laroe was to make $6 million in payments to Sherman, secured by a mortgage on all of the development, and Sherman was to sell Laroe parcels of land within the proposed subdivision when the MareBrook plan was approved.  However, Laroe reserved the right to terminate the entire agreement if Sherman was unable to obtain Town approval for a sufficient number of lots.  While this agreement was in place and Sherman continued his futile quest for regulatory approval, Laroe paid Sherman more than $2.5 million.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, TD Bank commenced a foreclosure proceeding on Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s property.  In an effort to save the deal, Laroe and Sherman entered into a new agreement.  That agreement provided that the purchase price of the property would be the $2.5 million that Laroe had already advanced Sherman plus any amount Sherman had to pay to settle with TD Bank.  Once the Town approved the plan, Laroe was required to transfer a certain number of lots back to Sherman.  In addition to imposing this transfer obligation, the agreement deemed Laroe to have paid for the land in full.  Laroe was also given the authority to settle the debt Sherman owed TD Bank and to terminate the agreement if the settlement failed.  The settlement did fail, and TD Bank took over the property.  But Laroe never terminated its agreement with Sherman.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In support of its motion to intervene, Laroe argued that, under New York law, it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe equitable owner of the Real Property\xe2\x80\x9d at issue in Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  App. 131, 135\xe2\x80\x93139.  Laroe asserted that its status as equitable owner gave it an interest in the MareBrook property; that its interest would be impaired if it could not intervene; and that Sherman \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] his own agenda\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently could not adequately represent Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s interest.  <i>Id.</i>, at 143\xe2\x80\x93145.  Along with its other intervention-related pleadings, Laroe filed an intervenor\xe2\x80\x99s complaint asserting a regulatory takings claim that was substantively identical to Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s.  Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s complaint sought, among other things, a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment against [the Town] awarding [Laroe] damages,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for the taking of Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the subject real property.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 162.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court denied Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s motion to intervene on the ground that Laroe lacked standing to bring a takings claim \xe2\x80\x9cbased on its status as contract vendee to the property.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.

The same principle applies when there are multiple plaintiffs.  At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.  Both of the parties accept this simple rule.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same principle applies to intervenors of right.  Although the context is different, the rule is the same: For all relief sought, there must be a litigant with standing, whether that litigant joins the lawsuit as a plaintiff, a coplaintiff, or an intervenor of right.  Thus, at the least, an intervenor of right must demonstrate Article III standing when it seeks additional relief beyond that which the plaintiff requests.  This result follows ineluctably from our Article III case law, so it is not surprising that both parties accept it (as does the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i>).  See Brief for Petitioner 13 (arguing that an intervenor must always demonstrate standing); Brief for Respondent 28 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n intervenor who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. seeks relief beyond that requested by a party with standing must satisfy Arti-cle III\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16 (An intervenor must demonstrate its own standing if it \xe2\x80\x9cseek[s] damages\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctive relief that is broader than or different from the relief sought by the original plaintiff(s)\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, an intervenor of right must have Article III standing in order to pursue relief that is different from that which is sought by a party with standing.  That includes cases in which both the plaintiff and the intervenor seek separate money judgments in their own names.  Cf. <i>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. </i>v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375,\n402, n.\n22 (1982)\n (declining to address the State\xe2\x80\x99s standing \xe2\x80\x9cuntil [it] obtains relief different from that sought by plaintiffs whose standing has not been questioned\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That principle dictates the disposition of this case.  It is unclear whether Laroe seeks the same relief as Sherman or instead seeks different relief, such as a money judgment against the Town in Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s own name.  Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s complaint\xe2\x80\x94the best evidence of the relief Laroe seeks\xe2\x80\x94requests a judgment awarding damages <i>to Laroe</i>.  App. 162.  Unsurprisingly, Sherman requests something different: specifically, compensation for the taking of <i>his</i> interest in the property.  <i>Id.</i>, at 122.  In other words, as Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s counsel conceded at oral argument, the complaint plainly seeks separate monetary relief for Laroe directly against the Town.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  And, as Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s counsel conceded further, if Laroe <i>is</i> \xe2\x80\x9cseeking additional damages in [its] own name,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cat that point, an Article III inquiry would be required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 47.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, at some points during argument in the Court of Appeals, Laroe made statements that arguably indicated that Laroe is not seeking damages different from those sought by Sherman.  In particular, Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s counsel stated that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot saying that Sherman and [Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s] damages are not the same damages,\xe2\x80\x9d and insisted that there is \xe2\x80\x9cexactly one fund, and the town doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything except turn over the fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr.\xc2\xa016, 33; see also Reply Brief in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931086 (CA2), p.\xc2\xa012 (similar).  At other points, however, the same counsel made statements pointing in the opposite direction.  When asked directly whether \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be separate awards to you and to the Sherman estate\xe2\x80\x9d if Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s suit was successful, Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s counsel admitted that he \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] never contemplated how [damages] ge[t] allocated at the end of the day\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested bifurcated proceedings so that once liability was settled, Laroe and Sherman could \xe2\x80\x9cduke it out\xe2\x80\x9d over damages if necessary.  Tr. 32\xe2\x80\x9335.  And in its Court of Appeals briefing, Laroe argued that it\xe2\x80\x94not Sherman\xe2\x80\x94would be entitled to most of the damages from the takings claim, flagging the allocation issue as one that the District Court would have to resolve.

Taken together, these representations at best leave it ambiguous whether Laroe is seeking damages for itself or is simply seeking the same damages sought by Sherman.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals did not resolve this ambiguity.  In fact, the section of its opinion concerning standing did not discuss whether Laroe sought different relief than Sherman.  <i>Id</i>., at 64\xe2\x80\x9366.  Elsewhere, in a different context, the court did acknowledge Laroe\xe2\x80\x99s statement that it sought \xe2\x80\x9cessentially the same\xe2\x80\x9d damages as Sherman.  <i>Id.</i>, at 66.
