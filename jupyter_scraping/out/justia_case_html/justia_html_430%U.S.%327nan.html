JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellee Harry Vail, Jr., is a judgment debtor who was held in contempt of court by the County Court of Dutchess County, N.Y., and who thereafter sought to have the statutory provisions authorizing contempts enjoined as unconstitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 430 U. S. 329</a></p><p> in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The state court proceedings against Vail were found by the District Court to be, in most respects, representative of those against the other named appellees as well. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Vail defaulted on a credit arrangement with the Public Loan Co., and, in January, 1974, a default judgment for $534.36 was entered against him in the City Court of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  Three months later, when the judgment remained unpaid, Vail was served with a subpoena requiring him to attend a deposition so as to give information relevant to the satisfaction of the judgment. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The subpoena required him to appear at the office of the creditor\'s attorney on May 28, a little more than a month after the date on which it was served, and stated, as is required by N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 5223 (McKinney 1963), that "failure to comply . . . is punishable as a contempt of court."</p>\n<p>Vail did not appear for the deposition.  Nearly two months after the scheduled deposition date, appellant Juidice, a Justice of the Dutchess County Court, issued an order requiring Vail to appear in that court on August 13 to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Vail failed to appear for that hearing.  On August 30, appellant Juidice entered an order holding Vail in contempt and imposing a fine in the amount of $250 plus costs. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Vail failed to pay the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 430 U. S. 330</a></p><p> fine.  On September 23, appellant Juidice issued an <em>ex parte</em> commitment order, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and Vail was arrested and jailed pursuant to this order on October 1.  He was released the following day when he paid the fine which had been imposed by the order.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Vail, who had ignored for a period of more than nine months every stage of the stated court proceedings in which he had been a defendant, became a plaintiff in an action brought in the United States District Court.  He and his coplaintiffs there sought to enjoin, on behalf of a class of judgment debtors, the use of the statutory contempt procedures authorized by New York law and employed by appellant justices on the ground that the procedures leading to imprisonment for contempt of court violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  As they never appeared in the New York courts, they obviously did not raise these constitutional claims in the state court proceedings.  The contentions made before the District Court, however, <em>could</em> have been raised by appellees in the state courts as a defense to the ongoing proceedings. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Had the County Court ruled against these contentions, appellees could have appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  They chose, by resorting to the federal courts, not to avail themselves of this forum afforded them by the State of New York.  We must decide whether, with the existence of an available forum for raising constitutional issues in a state judicial proceeding, the United States District Court could properly entertain appellees\' \xc2\xa7 1983 action in light of our decisions in <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971), and <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html">420 U. S. 592</a></span> (1975).  We hold that it could not. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 430 U. S. 331</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>A three-judge District Court was convened in response to appellees\' complaint and the action was later certified as a Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2) class action.  The class was defined to include</p>\n<p>"all persons who have been, or are presently subject to the civil contempt proceedings contained in the challenged sections of the Judiciary Law."</p>\n<p>App. to Jurisdictional Statement 18a.  At the same time, the District Court rendered an opinion granting partial summary judgment to the appellees and</p>\n<p>"declaring that Sections 756, 757, 770, 772, 773, 774 and 775 of the Judiciary Law of the State of New York are unconstitutional on their face, and permanently enjoining the operation of said statutes against plaintiffs and members of their class, namely, all persons who have been or are presently subject to civil contempt proceedings pursuant to the above sections of the Judiciary Law. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 20a.</p>\n<p>Appellants in this Court challenged the District Court\'s failure to abstain on <em>Younger</em> grounds, as well as its decision on the merits.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 426 U.S. 946, and since we agree with appellants\' first contention, we do not reach the merits of the constitutional dispute. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Although raised by neither of the parties, we are first obliged to examine the standing of appellees, as a matter of the case or controversy requirement associated with Art. III, to seek injunctive relief in the District Court.  <em>North Carolina v. Rice,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/244/case.html">404 U. S. 244</a></span> (1971); <em>O\'Shea v. Littleton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html">414 U. S. 488</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html#493">414 U. S. 493</a></span>-498 (1974).  At the time this lawsuit was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 430 U. S. 332</a></p><p> commenced, or the additional appellees added, the named appellees, except Patrick Ward and Joseph Rabasco, had already been imprisoned pursuant to the contempt order, and, again excepting Ward and Rabasco, had been released after payment of the court-imposed fine.  Ward had not been imprisoned, but alleged that he was "in imminent danger of being imprisoned pursuant to the Order of Contempt. . . ."  Complaint 155.  A temporary restraining order, which has remained in effect throughout this lawsuit, was issued by the District Court, enjoining the State from incarcerating Ward pursuant to the contempt order.  Rabasco similarly alleged the threat of imprisonment after the issuance by the state court of an order to show cause which he has not complied with.  The District Court restrained further state proceedings against Rabasco.</p>\n<p>All of the named appellees, except Ward and Rabasco, then, having been released from jail, no longer had a live controversy with appellants or other New York State officials as to either the contempt citation or the short periods of incarceration which would entitle them to injunctive relief.  These New York supplemental proceedings, which follow judgments on a debt, differ in this respect from the Ohio State proceedings involved in <em>Huffman, supra.</em>  In <em>Huffman,</em> the Ohio State court had closed down the federal plaintiff\'s movie house for a period of time in the future.  Although its decree had become final at the time the federal plaintiff instituted its federal action, the effect of the decree continued.  420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#598">420 U. S. 598</a></span>.  That plaintiff accordingly had the requisite standing.  <em>O\'Shea v. Littleton, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html#495">414 U. S. 495</a></span>-496.  Here, however, once the period of incarceration is served or the fine paid, the effect of the orders imposing a fine or commitment has expended itself.  And, in the case where the payment of the fine satisfies the entire judgment, not only the orders in the supplemental proceedings but the original judgment as well is rendered <em>functus officio.</em>  As </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 430 U. S. 333</a></p><p> the complaint does not allege, and as the District Court did not find, that these appellees were threatened with further or repeated proceedings, only Ward and Rabasco had the necessary standing to seek injunctive relief. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>See Ellis v. Dyson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/426/case.html">421 U. S. 426</a></span> (1975); <em>Steffel v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/case.html">415 U. S. 452</a></span> (1974).  Appellees Ward and Rabasco do have standing, since they are subject to pending proceedings in the state courts.  Since Ward and Rabasco have standing, and since their standing, unlike that of the plaintiff in <em>Steffel v. Thompson, supra,</em> is predicated on the existence of a pending, and not merely a threatened, proceeding, we deal with appellants\' <em>Younger</em> contentions.</p>\n<p>The District Court decided that our holdings in <em>Younger</em> and <em>Huffman</em> did not mandate dismissal of the complaint in this case, because the action sought to be enjoined in <em>Younger</em> was a criminal prosecution, and the action sought to be enjoined in <em>Huffman</em> was for the abatement of a civil nuisance, and therefore closely akin to a criminal proceeding. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 430 U. S. 334</a></p><p> was not an implausible reading of our holdings in those cases, since, in <em>Huffman,</em> the most recent of the two, we had reserved the applicability of abstention to civil cases generally in this language:</p>\n<p>"Informed by the relevant principles of comity and federalism, at least three Courts of Appeals have applied <em>Younger</em> when the pending state proceedings were civil in nature.  <em>See Duke v. Texas,</em> 477 F.2d 244 (CA5 1973); <em>Lynch v. Snepp,</em> 472 F.2d 769 (CA4 1973); <em>Cousins v. Wigoda,</em> 463 F.2d 603 (CA7 1972).  For the purposes of the case before us, however, we need make no general pronouncements upon the applicability of <em>Younger</em> to all civil litigation.  It suffices to say that, for the reasons heretofore set out, we conclude that the District Court should have applied the tests laid down in <em>Younger</em> in determining whether to proceed to the merits of appellee\'s prayer for relief against this Ohio civil nuisance proceeding."</p>\n<p>420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#607">420 U. S. 607</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We now hold, however, that the principles of <em>Younger</em> and <em>Huffman</em> are not confined solely to the types of state actions which were sought to be enjoined in those cases.  As we emphasized in <em>Huffman,</em> the "<em>more vital consideration\'" behind the <em>Younger</em> doctrine of nonintervention lay not in the fact that the state criminal process was involved, but rather in\n</em></p>\n<p>""the notion of <em>comity,\' that is, a proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways"" </em></p>\n<p><em>Huffman,</em> 420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#601">420 U.

In <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a></span> (1908), the watershed case which sanctioned the use of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a sword as well as a shield against unconstitutional conduct of state officers, the Court said:</p>\n<p>"But the Federal court cannot, of course, interfere in a case where the proceedings were already pending in a state court.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/83/366/case.html">Taylor v.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>These principles apply to a case in which the State\'s contempt process is involved.  A State\'s interest in the contempt process, through which it vindicates the regular operation of its judicial system, so long as that system itself affords the opportunity to pursue federal claims within it, is surely an important interest.  Perhaps it is not quite as important as is the State\'s interest in the enforcement of its criminal laws, <em>Younger, supra,</em> or even its interest in the maintenance of a <em>quasi</em>-criminal proceeding such as was involved in <em>Huffman, supra.</em>  But we think it is of sufficiently great import to require application of the principles of those cases.  The contempt power lies at the core of the administration of a State\'s judicial system, <em>cf. Ketchum v. Edwards,</em> 153 N.Y. 534, 539, 47 N.E. 918, 920 (1897).  Whether disobedience of a court-sanctioned subpoena, and the resulting process leading to a finding of contempt of court, is labeled civil, <em>quasi</em>-criminal, or criminal in nature, we think the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 430 U. S. 336</a></p><p> salient fact is that federal court interference with the State\'s contempt process is "an offense to the State\'s interest . . . likely to be every bit as great as it would be were this a criminal proceeding," <em>Huffman, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#604">420 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Moreover, such interference with the contempt process not only "unduly interfere[s] with the legitimate activities of the Stat[e]," <em>Younger, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#44">401 U.

But <em>Gerstein</em> explained the reason for the inapplicability of <em>Younger</em> to that case in a way which clearly distinguishes it from this:</p>\n<p>"The District Court correctly held that respondents\' claim for relief was not barred by the equitable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="337">Page 430 U.

[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  No more is required to invoke <em>Younger</em> abstention.  There is no support in <em>Gerstein</em> or in our other cases for the District Court\'s belief that the state courts must have an actual hearing (to which a recalcitrant defendant would presumably be brought by force) in order for <em>Younger</em> and <em>Huffman</em> to apply.  Appellees need be accorded only an opportunity to fairly pursue their constitutional claims in the ongoing state proceedings, <em>Gibson v.

Nor is the first part of the exception either alleged in appellees\' complaint or proved by their evidence.  While some paragraphs of the complaint could be construed to make such allegations as to the creditors, there are no comparable allegations with respect to appellant justices who issued the contempt orders.

As to him, and the other appellees similarly situated, since the underlying action on the debt, to which the contempt proceedings were ancillary, had not ended, it is conceivable that the prospect of further contempt orders in the underlying action could have given Vail the requisite constitutional standing to seek to enjoin the contempt processes as unconstitutional.  But standing cannot be based on such speculative conjectures which are neither alleged nor proved.

The crystal clarity of the congressional decision and purpose in adopting \xc2\xa7 1983, and the unbroken line of this Court\'s cases enforcing that decision, expose <em>Huffman</em> and today\'s decision as deliberate and conscious floutings of a decision Congress was constitutionally empowered to make.  It stands the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy on its head to deny the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff access to the federal forum because of the pendency of state civil proceedings where Congress intended that the district court should entertain his suit without regard to the pendency of the state suit.  Rather than furthering principles of comity and our federalism, forced federal abdication in this context undercuts one of the chief values of federalism -- the protection and vindication of important and overriding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 430 U. S. 344</a></p><p> federal civil rights, which Congress, in \xc2\xa7 1983 and the Judiciary Act of 1875, ordained should be a primary responsibility of the federal courts.</p>\n<p><em>Mitchum v. Foster, supra,</em> buttresses this conclusion.  <em>Mitchum</em> held that \xc2\xa7 1983 comes within the "expressly authorized" exception of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283 so as to permit a federal district court in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit to stay a proceeding in a state court.  The process begun in <em>Huffman</em> and furthered today of cutting back the remedies available in federal court under \xc2\xa7 1983 plainly reintroduces much of the rigidity of \xc2\xa7 2283, thus realizing the prophecy that, if <em>Younger</em> were extended to civil cases,</p>\n<p>"the significance of <em>Mitchum</em> for those seeking relief from state civil proceedings would largely be destroyed, and the recognition of section 1983 as an exception to the Anti-Injunction Statute would have been a Pyrrhic victory."</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, 1971 Term, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 50, 217-218 (1972).</p>\n<p>Today\'s decision extends <em>Huffman,</em> which labeled the state nuisance proceeding, "in important respects . . . , more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases."  420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#604">420 U. S. 604</a></span>.  By contrast, the underlying suits in the New York courts here were collection suits typically involving small loans, and usually terminating in default judgments.  Further, whereas, in <em>Huffman,</em> state officials were parties in the state court suit, here, those suits are between purely private parties.  Whatever the importance of the State\'s direct interest in <em>Huffman</em> in closing theaters exhibiting alleged obscene films, one must strain hard to discover any comparable state interest here in having federal rights adjudicated in a state, rather than a federal, forum.  Thus, <em>Huffman</em>\'s "<em>quasi</em>-criminal" rationale and today\'s reliance on state "contempt power" are revealed to be only covers for the ultimate goal of denying \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs the federal forum in any case, civil or criminal, when a pending state proceeding may hear the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 430 U. S. 345</a></p><p> federal plaintiff\'s federal claims. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html">*</a></span>  This is nothing less than plain refusal to enforce the congressional direction, and, for all practical purposes, reduces <em>Mitchum v. Foster</em> to an empty shell.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a requirement that the \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiff present his constitutional challenge in a suit between purely private parties pending in a state court may not be viewed as an unmixed blessing by the States.  When <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971), was decided, purely private state court suits were seen as posing entirely different considerations from criminal prosecutions.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#55">401 U. S. 55</a></span>, and n. 2 (STEWART, J., concurring).  Pending state criminal proceedings have always been viewed as paradigm cases involving paramount state interests.  <em>Huffman,</em> 420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html#613">420 U. S. 613</a></span>-614 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  But remitting the decision of the constitutionality of state statutes to state civil proceedings between purely private parties may actually run counter to state interests.  If the State may not be heard in the state civil case, defense of the constitutionality of its statute would be solely in the hands of a party having neither the State\'s resources, expertise, nor governmental interest in sustaining the validity of the statute.  A dilemma would be posed even for officials of a State like New York having procedures that permit, N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 1012(b) (McKinney 1976), and in some cases require, N.Y.Exec.Law \xc2\xa7 71 (McKinney 1972), state intervention in suits raising constitutional challenges to state statutes.  They must choose whether to intervene in countless private lawsuits brought all over the State implicating the constitutionality of state statutes, or not to intervene and risk adverse decisions having effects far beyond the interests of the particular private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 430 U. S. 346</a></p><p> parties.  By contrast, a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit in federal court necessarily names the State or its officials as defendants, and the litigation focuses squarely on the issue of the validity of the statute, with the State defending its own interest directly.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the process of eviscerating \xc2\xa7 1983 should not come as a surprise.  This Court, in a series of decisions in other contexts, has shaped the doctrines of jurisdiction, justiciability, and remedy so as increasingly to bar the federal courthouse door to litigants with substantial federal claims.  <em>See Rizzo v. Goode,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/362/case.html">423 U. S. 362</a></span> (1976); <em>Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/26/case.html">426 U. S. 26</a></span> (1976); <em>Warth v. Seldin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/case.html">422 U. S. 490</a></span> (1975); <em>O\'Shea v. Littleton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html">414 U. S. 488</a></span> (1974).  The determination to keep \xc2\xa7 1983 litigants out of the federal courthouse if they can be remitted to a state court, reflected not only in <em>Huffman</em> and today\'s decision but in other decisions, <em>e.g., Hicks v. Miranda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/332/case.html">422 U. S. 332</a></span> (1975), hardly serves the values of federalism, any more than did last Term\'s decisions that so circumscribed the centuries-old remedy of habeas corpus as to weaken drastically the federal courts\' ability to safeguard individuals from unconstitutional imprisonment.  <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span> (1976); <em>Francis v. Henderson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/536/case.html">425 U. S. 536</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>These decisions have in common that they have been rendered in the name of federalism.  But they have given this great concept a distorted and disturbing meaning.  Under the banner of vague, undefined notions of equity, comity, and federalism, the Court has embarked upon the dangerous course of condoning both isolated, <em>Paul v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/693/case.html">424 U. S. 693</a></span> (1976), and systematic, <em>Rizzo v. Goode, supra,</em> violations of civil liberties.  Such decisions hardly bespeak a true concern for equity.  Nor do they properly reflect the nature of our federalism.</p>\n<p>"Adopting the premise that state courts can be trusted to safeguard individual rights, the Supreme Court has gone on to limit the protective role of the federal judiciary.  But, in so doing, it has forgotten that one of the strengths of our federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 430 U.

Federalism is not served when the federal half of that protection is crippled."</p>\n<p>Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 489, 502-503 (1977).  I dissent.</p>\n<p>* I suspect that the purported disclaimer that, "[a]s we did in <em>Huffman,</em> we save for another day the question of <em>the applicability of <em>Younger</em> to all civil litigation . . . ,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html#336">430 U. S. 336</a></span> n. 13, is tongue in cheek, and that "save" in today\'s disclaimer is a signal that merely the formal announcement is being postponed.\n</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The District Court found New York\'s statutorily specified civil contempt procedures constitutionally inadequate.  It reached that conclusion without the benefit of a state court construction of the statute\'s procedural requirements; without consideration of whether the procedural infirmities found were limited to the class of subpoenaed civil debtors who originally filed suit; without, indeed, a determination as to whether the challenged procedures accurately reflect statewide New York practice, or were instead confined to Dutchess County.<l=>*  Constitutional adjudication in the face of such legal and factual imponderables is foolhardy:  the subject matter of the suit is unclear, and the very need for constitutional adjudication is uncertain.</l=></p>\n<p>When a federal district court confronts such uncertainty in state law, its proper course is to abstain from final resolution of the federal issues until the state courts have been accorded an opportunity authoritatively to interpret the state statutory scheme being challenged.  <em>Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U. S. 496</a></span>.  The state court construction may obviate or significantly modify the federal questions seemingly presented, thus avoiding</p>\n<p>"unnecessary friction in federal-state relations, interference with important state functions, tentative decisions on questions of state law, and premature constitutional adjudication."</p>\n<p><em>Harman v. Forssenius,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/528/case.html">380 U. S. 528</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/528/case.html#534">380 U. S. 534</a></span>.  Those considerations were sacrificed here, when the District Court nevertheless proceeded to measure the ambiguous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 430 U. S. 348</a></p><p> provisions of State law against the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Even though the prerequisites of <em>Pullman</em> abstention are clearly met in this case, the Court rejects a routine application of that established doctrine in favor of a novel extension of the <em>Younger-Huffman</em> line of "abstention" cases.  <em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>; <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/592/case.html">420 U. S. 592</a></span>.  That is a departure from prior cases, which have not reached the <em>Younger</em> question when grounds for <em>Pullman</em> abstention were clear.  <em>See, e.g., Carey v. Sugar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/73/case.html">425 U. S. 73</a></span>; <em>Harron v. NAACP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/167/case.html">360 U. S. 167</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Both types of "abstention," of course, serve the common goal of judicial restraint as a means of avoiding undue federal interference with state goals and functions.  But there is a significant difference in result between the two.  Under <em>Pullman</em> abstention, the federal court may retain jurisdiction pending state court interpretation of an ambiguous statute, while under <em>Younger,</em> it may not.  The <em>Pullman</em> approach thus has the advantage of not altogether foreclosing access to federal courts to vindicate federal rights, while still avoiding needless friction in federal-state relations.</p>\n<p>Viewing this case as a paradigm for <em>Pullman</em> abstention, I would set aside the judgment of the District Court and direct it to retain jurisdiction pending a definitive construction of the statutes in question by the courts of New York.</p>\n<p>* The record suggests that the courts of New York City may apply the statutes in question in quite a different manner.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
