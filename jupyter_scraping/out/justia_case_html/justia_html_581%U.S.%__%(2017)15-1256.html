The trial court imposed a prison term of 20 years to life and ordered her to pay $8,192.50 in court costs, fees, and restitution.

The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered him to pay $4,413.00 in costs, fees, and restitution.  After one of Madden\xe2\x80\x99s convictions was reversed on direct review and the other vacated on postconviction review, the State elected not to appeal or retry the case.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s inmate account between her conviction and acquittal, and Madden paid the State $1,977.75 after his conviction.  In both cases, the funds were allocated to costs, fees, and restitution.  Once their convictions were invalidated, both petitioners moved for return of the funds.  Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s trial court denied her motion outright, and Madden\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction court allowed a refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.  The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that both petitioners were entitled to seek refunds of all they had paid, but the Colorado Supreme Court reversed.  It reasoned that Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Compensation for Certain Exonerated Persons statute (Exoneration Act or Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93101, 13\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93102, 13\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93103, provided the exclusive authority for refunds and that, because neither Nelson nor Madden had filed a claim under that Act, the courts lacked authority to order refunds.  The Colorado Supreme Court also held that there was no due process problem under the Act, which permits Colorado to retain conviction-related assessments unless and until the prevailing defendant institutes a discrete civil proceeding and proves her innocence by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Exoneration Act\xe2\x80\x99s scheme does not comport with the\n \nFourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of due process.

The State may not retain these funds simply because Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s and Madden\xe2\x80\x99s convictions were in place when the funds were taken, for once those convictions were erased, the presumption of innocence was restored.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Mississippi</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578\n.

Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s scheme creates an unacceptable risk of the erroneous deprivation of defendants\xe2\x80\x99 property.  The Exoneration Act conditions refund on defendants\xe2\x80\x99 proof of innocence by clear and convincing evidence, but defendants in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position are presumed innocent.  Moreover, the Act provides no remedy for assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions.  And when, as here, the recoupment amount sought is not large, the cost of mounting a claim under the Act and retaining counsel to pursue it would be prohibitive.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Colorado argues that an Act that provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty must suffice to compensate a defendant for the lesser deprivation of money.  But Nelson and Madden seek the return of their property, not compensation for its temporary deprivation.  Just as restoration of liberty on reversal of a conviction is not compensation, neither is the return of money taken by the State on account of the conviction.  Other procedures cited by Colorado\xe2\x80\x94the need for probable cause to support criminal charges, the jury-trial right, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x94do not address the risk faced by a defendant whose conviction has been overturned that she will not recover funds taken from her based solely on a conviction no longer valid.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">(3)\xc2\xa0Colorado has no interest in withholding from Nelson and Madden money to which the State currently has zero claim of right.

Our answer is yes.  Absent conviction of a crime, one is presumed innocent.  Under the Colorado law before us in these cases, however, the State retains conviction-related assessments unless and until the prevailing defendant institutes a discrete civil proceeding and proves her innocence by clear and convincing evidence.

Petitioner Shannon Nelson, in 2006, was convicted by a Colorado jury of five counts\xe2\x80\x94two felonies and three misdemeanors\xe2\x80\x94arising from the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her four children.  362 P.\xc2\xa03d 1070, 1071 (Colo. 2015); App. 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 20 years to life and ordered Nelson to pay court costs, fees, and restitution totaling $8,192.50.  362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1071.  On appeal, Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was reversed for trial error.  <i>Ibid.  </i>On retrial, a new jury acquitted Nelson of all charges.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner Louis Alonzo Madden, in 2005, was convicted by a Colorado jury of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted third-degree sexual assault by force.  See 364 P.\xc2\xa03d 866, 867 (Colo. 2015).  The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered Madden to pay costs, fees, and restitution totaling $4,413.00.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The Colorado Supreme Court reversed one of Madden\xe2\x80\x99s convictions on direct review, and a postconviction court vacated the other.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The State elected not to appeal or retry the case.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Between Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and acquittal, the Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from her inmate account, $287.50 of which went to costs and fees[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] and $414.60 to restitution.  See 362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1071, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Following Madden\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, Madden paid Colorado $1,977.75, $1,220 of which went to costs and fees[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] and $757.75 to restitution.  See 364 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 867.  The sole legal basis for these assessments was the fact of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s and Madden\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Absent those convictions, Colorado would have no legal right to exact and retain petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 funds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Their convictions invalidated, both petitioners moved for return of the amounts Colorado had taken from them.

In Madden\xe2\x80\x99s case, the postconviction court allowed the refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.  364 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 867\xe2\x80\x93868.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same Colorado Court of Appeals panel heard both cases and concluded that Nelson and Madden were entitled to seek refunds of all they had paid, including amounts allocated to restitution.

As no other statute addresses refunds, the court concluded that the Exoneration Act is the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive process for exonerated defendants seeking a refund of costs, fees, and restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1078.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Because neither Nelson nor Madden had filed a claim under the Act, the court further determined, their trial courts lacked authority to order a refund.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1075, 1078; 364 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 867.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  There was no due process problem, the court continued, because the Act \xe2\x80\x9cprovides sufficient process for defendants to seek refunds of costs, fees, and restitution that they paid in connection with their conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1078.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Hood dissented in both cases.  Because neither petitioner has been validly convicted, he explained, each must be presumed innocent.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1079 (<i>Nelson</i>); 364 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 870 (adopting his reasoning from <i>Nelson </i>in <i>Madden</i>).  Due process therefore requires some mechanism \xe2\x80\x9cfor the return of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s money,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Hood maintained, 362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1080; as the Exoneration Act required petitioners to prove their innocence, the Act, he concluded, did not supply the remedy due process demands, <i>id.</i>, at 1081.  We granted certiorari.  579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Exoneration Act provides a civil claim for relief \xe2\x80\x9cto compensate an innocent person who was wrongly con-victed.\xe2\x80\x9d  362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1075.  Recovery under the Act is avail-able only to a defendant who has served all or part of a term of incarceration pursuant to a felony conviction, and whose conviction has been overturned for reasons other than insufficiency of evidence or legal error unrelated to actual innocence.  See \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93102.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The familiar procedural due process inspection instructed by <i>Mathews</i> v. <i>Eldridge</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 319 (1976)\n, governs these cases.  Colorado argues that we should instead apply the standard from <i>Medina</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437,\n445 (1992)\n, and inquire whether Nelson and Madden were exposed to a procedure offensive to a fundamental principle of justice.  <i>Medina</i> \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state procedural rules\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9care part of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 443.  Such rules concern, for example, the allocation of burdens of proof and the type of evidence qualifying as admissible.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  These cases, in contrast, concern the continuing deprivation of property after a conviction has been reversed or vacated, with no prospect of reprosecution.  See <i>Kaley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2014) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, n.\xc2\xa04) (explaining the different offices of <i>Mathews</i> and <i>Medina</i>).  Because no further criminal process is implicated, <i>Mathews</i> \xe2\x80\x9cprovides the relevant inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa04).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under the <i>Mathews</i> balancing test, a court evaluates (A)\xc2\xa0the private interest affected; (B)\xc2\xa0the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used; and (C)\xc2\xa0the governmental interest at stake.  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 335.  All three considerations weigh decisively against Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nelson and Madden have an obvious interest in regaining the money they paid to Colorado.  Colorado urges, however, that the funds belong to the State because Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s and Madden\xe2\x80\x99s convictions were in place when the funds were taken.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  But once those convictions were erased, the presumption of their innocence was restored.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Mississippi</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578,\n585 (1988)\n (After a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction has been reversed, unless and until [the defendant] should be retried, he must be presumed innocent of that charge.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]xiomatic and elementary,\xe2\x80\x9d the presumption of innocence \xe2\x80\x9clies at the foundation of our criminal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Coffin</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432,\n453 (1895)\n.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  Colorado may not retain funds taken from Nelson and Madden solely because of their now-invalidated convictions, see <i>supra</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n.\xc2\xa03, for Colorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty <i>enough</i> for monetary exactions.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That petitioners prevailed on subsequent review rather than in the first instance, moreover, should be inconsequential.  Suppose a trial judge grants a motion to set aside a guilty verdict for want of sufficient evidence.  In that event, the defendant pays no costs, fees, or restitution.  Now suppose the trial court enters judgment on a guilty verdict, ordering cost, fee, and restitution payments by reason of the conviction, but the appeals court upsets the conviction for evidentiary insufficiency.  By what right does the State retain the amount paid out by the defendant?  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t should make no difference that the <i>reviewing</i> court, rather than the trial court, determined the evidence to be insufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n11 (1978)\n.  The vulnerability of the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it can keep the amounts exacted so long as it prevailed in the court of first instance is more apparent still if we assume a case in which the sole penalty is a fine.  On Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, an appeal would leave the defendant emptyhanded; regardless of the outcome of an appeal, the State would have no refund obligation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 44.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Is there a risk of erroneous deprivation of defendants\xe2\x80\x99 interest in return of their funds if, as Colorado urges, the Exoneration Act is the exclusive remedy?  Indeed yes, for the Act conditions refund on defendants\xe2\x80\x99 proof of innocence by clear and convincing evidence.  \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93101(1)(a).  But to get their money back, defendants should not be saddled with any proof burden.  Instead, as explained <i>supra</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, they are entitled to be presumed innocent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Furthermore, as Justice Hood noted in dissent, the Act provides no remedy at all for any assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions (Nelson had three).  362 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1081, n.\xc2\xa01; see \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9365\xe2\x80\x93102(1)(a).  And when amounts a defendant seeks to recoup are not large, as is true in Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s and Madden\xe2\x80\x99s cases, see <i>supra</i>, at 2, the cost of mounting a claim under the Exoneration Act and retaining a lawyer to pursue it would be prohibitive.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Colorado argued on brief that if the Exoneration Act provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty, the Act should also suffice \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a defendant seeks compensation for the less significant deprivation of monetary assessments paid pursuant to a conviction that is later overturned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 40.  The comparison is inapt.  Nelson and Madden seek restoration of funds they paid to the State, not compensation for temporary deprivation of those funds.

These cases concern Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s rules for determining whether a defendant can obtain a refund of money that he or she was required to pay pursuant to a judgment of conviction that is later reversed.  In holding that these payments must be refunded, the Court relies on a feature of the criminal law, the presumption of innocence.  And since the Court demands that refunds occur either automatically or at least without imposing anything more than \xe2\x80\x9cminimal\xe2\x80\x9d procedures, see <i>ante</i>, at 10, it appears that they must generally occur as part of the criminal case.

These stringent requirements all but guarantee that most defendants whose convictions are reversed have no realistic opportunity to prove they are deserving of refunds.  Colorado has abandoned historical procedures that were more generous to successful appellants and incorporated a court\xe2\x80\x99s case-specific equitable judgment.  Instead, Colorado has adopted a system that is harsh, inflexible, and prevents most defendants whose convictions are reversed from demonstrating entitlement to a refund.

Accordingly, the Exoneration Act does not satisfy due process requirements.  See <i>Cooper </i>v.<i> Oklahoma</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 348,\n356 (1996)\n (A state rule of criminal procedure may violate due process where \xe2\x80\x9ca rule significantly more favorable to the defendant has had a long and consistent application\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although long-established practice supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, the Court rests its decision on different grounds.  In its <i>Mathews</i> analysis, the Court reasons that the reversal of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions restored the presumption of their innocence and that \xe2\x80\x9cColorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty <i>enough</i> for monetary exactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 7.  The implication of this brief statement is that under <i>Mathews</i>, reversal restores the defendant to the <i>status quo ante</i>, see <i>ante</i>, at 3.  But the Court does not confront the obvious implications of this reasoning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For example, if the <i>status quo ante</i> must be restored, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the defendant be compensated for all the adverse economic consequences of the wrongful conviction?[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  After all, in most cases, the fines and payments that a convicted defendant must pay to the court are minor in comparison to the losses that result from conviction and imprisonment, such as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, lost income, and damage to reputation.  The Court cannot convincingly explain why <i>Mathews</i>\xe2\x80\x99 amorphous balancing test stops short of requiring a full return to the <i>status quo ante</i> when a conviction is reversed.  But <i>Medina</i> does.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The American legal system has long treated compensation for the economic consequences of a reversed conviction very differently from the refund of fines and other payments made by a defendant pursuant to a criminal judgment.  Statutes providing compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison are a 20th-century innovation: By 1970, only the Federal Government and four States had passed such laws.  King, Compensation of Persons Erroneously Confined by the State, 118 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1091, 1109 (1970); <i>United States </i>v.<i> Keegan</i>, 71 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 623, 626 (SDNY 1947) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here seems to have been no legislation by our Government on this subject\xe2\x80\x9d until 1938).  Many other jurisdictions have done so since, but under most such laws, compensation is not automatic.  Instead, the defendant bears the burden of proving actual innocence (and, sometimes, more).  King<i>, supra</i>, at 1110 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe burden of proving innocence in the compensation proceeding has from the start been placed upon the claimant\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Kahn, Presumed Guilty Until Proven Innocent: The Burden of Proof in Wrongful Conviction Claims Under State Compensation Statutes, 44 U. Mich. J.\xc2\xa0L. Reform 123, 145 (2010) (Most U.\xc2\xa0S. compensation statutes \xe2\x80\x9crequire that claimants prove their innocence either by a preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  In construing the federal statute, courts have held that a compensation proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cis not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a criminal trial\xe2\x80\x9d and that the burden of proof can be placed on the petitioner.  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Brunner</i>, 200 F.\xc2\xa02d 276, 279 (CA6 1952).  As noted, Colorado and many other States have similar statutes designed narrowly to compensate those few persons who can demonstrate that they are truly innocent.  The Court apparently acknowledges that these statutes pose no constitutional difficulty.  That is the correct conclusion, but it is best justified by reference to history and tradition.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s disregard of historical practice is particu-larly damaging when it comes to the question of restitution.  The Court flatly declares that the State is \xe2\x80\x9cobliged to refund .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. restitution\xe2\x80\x9d in just the same way as fees and court costs.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.  This conclusion is not supported by historical practice, and it overlooks important differences between restitution, which is paid to the victims of an offense, and fines and other payments that are kept by the State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although restitution may be included in a criminal judgment, it has many attributes of a civil judgment in favor of the victim.  This is clear under Colorado law.  Although the obligation to pay restitution is included in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, restitution results in a final civil judgment against the defendant in favor of the State <i>and the victim</i>.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x931.3\xe2\x80\x93603(4)(a)(I) (2016).  Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.  <i>People </i>v.<i> Pagan</i>, 165 P.\xc2\xa03d 724, 729 (Colo. App. 2006); Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718\xe2\x80\x931.3\xe2\x80\x93603(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  And the judgment may be enforced either by the State or the victim.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9318.5\xe2\x80\x93106(2), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9318.5\xe2\x80\x93107(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court ignores the distinctive attributes of restitution, but they merit attention.  Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.  Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as (potentially preclusive) evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7298, 473\xe2\x80\x93477 (7th ed. 2013) (discussing the admissibility, and potential preclusive effect, of a criminal conviction in subsequent civil litigation).  And suppose that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not (and could not) infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.  It would be unprecedented to suggest that due process requires unwinding the civil judgment simply because it rests in part on a criminal conviction that has since been reversed.  And a very similar scenario could unfold with respect to a Colorado restitution judgment.  The only salient difference would be that, in the Colorado case, the civil judgment would have been obtained as part of the criminal proceeding itself.  It is not clear (and the Court certainly does not explain) why that formal distinction should make a substantive difference.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is especially startling to insist that a State must provide a refund after enforcing a restitution judgment on the victims\xe2\x80\x99 behalf in reliance on a <i>final</i> judgment that is then vacated on <i>collateral</i> review.  Faced with this fact pattern, the Ninth Circuit declined to require reimbursement, reasoning that the Government was a mere \xe2\x80\x9cescrow agent\xe2\x80\x9d executing a then-valid final judgment in favor of a third party.  <i>United States </i>v.<i> Hayes</i>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d 1226, 1230 (2004).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court regrettably mentions none of this.  Its treatment of restitution is not grounded in any historical analysis, and\xe2\x80\x94save for a brief footnote, <i>ante</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, n.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x94the Court does not account for the distinctive civil status of restitution under Colorado law (or the laws of the many other affected jurisdictions that provide this remedy to crime victims).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the Court consider how restitution\xe2\x80\x99s unique characteristics might affect the balance that it strikes under <i>Mathews</i>.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  The Court summarily rejects the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98equitable considerations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d might militate against a blanket rule requiring the refund of money paid as restitution, see <i>ibid.</i>, but why is this so?  What if the evidence amply establishes that the defendant injured the victims to whom restitution was paid but the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction is reversed on a ground that would be inapplicable in a civil suit?  In that situation, is it true, as the Court proclaims, that the State would have \xe2\x80\x9cno interest\xe2\x80\x9d in withholding a refund?  Would the Court reach that conclusion if state law mandated a refund from the recipients of the restitution?  And if the States and the Federal Government are always required to foot the bill themselves, would  that risk discourage them from seeking restitution\xe2\x80\x94or at least from providing funds to victims until the conclusion of appellate review?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It was unnecessary for the Court to issue a sweeping pronouncement on restitution.  But if the Court had to address this subject to dispose of these cases, it should have acknowledged that\xe2\x80\x94at least in some circumstances\xe2\x80\x94refunds of restitution payments made under later reversed judgments are not constitutionally required.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In a footnote, the Court briefly opines on how a <i>Medina</i> analysis would come out in these cases.

It is true, of course, that this presumption is restored when a conviction is reversed.  But that says very little about the question at hand: namely, what must <i>happen</i> once that presumption is restored.

But both opinions bypass the most important question in these cases: whether petitioners can show a <i>substantive</i> entitlement to a return of the money they paid pursuant to criminal convictions that were later reversed or vacated.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court assumes, without reference to either state or federal law, that defendants whose convictions have been reversed have a substantive right to any money exacted on the basis of those convictions.  By doing so, the Court assumes away the real issue in these cases.  As the parties have agreed, the existence of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide particular procedures depends on whether petitioners have a substantive entitlement to the money.  Colorado concedes that \xe2\x80\x9cif [petitioners] have a present entitlement\xe2\x80\x9d to the money\xe2\x80\x94that is, if \xe2\x80\x9cit is their prop-erty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthen due process requires [the State to accord] themsome procedure to get it back.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  And Colorado acknowledges that the procedural hurdles it could impose before returning the money \xe2\x80\x9cwould be fairly minimal,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 51, because petitioners would need to prove only that their convictions had been reversed and that they had paid a certain sum of money, see <i>ibid.</i>  Similarly, petitioners concede that if defendants in their position do <i>not</i> have a substantive right to recover the money\xe2\x80\x94that is, if the money belongs to the State\xe2\x80\x94then Colorado need not \xe2\x80\x9cprovide any procedure to give it back.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 53.  If defendants in their position have no entitlement to the money they paid pursuant to their reversed convictions, there would be nothing to adjudicate.  In light of these concessions, I can see no justification for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to address the procedures for adjudicating a substantive entitlement while failing to determine whether a substantive entitlement exists in the first place.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, petitioners have not demonstrated that defendants whose convictions have been reversed possess a substantive entitlement, under either state law or the Constitution, to recover money they paid to the State pursuant to their convictions.  Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reverse the judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \xe2\x80\x9cdeprive any person of <i>life, liberty, or property</i>, without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S.

Petitioners contend that the money remains their property under state law.  Reply Brief 1\xe2\x80\x933; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\xe2\x80\x9354.

Under the Act, Colorado recognizes a substantive entitlement to the kind of property at issue in these cases only if, among other things, the defendant can prove that he is \xe2\x80\x9cactually innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Colo.

This Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to require that the States provide certain procedures, such as notice and a hearing, by which an individual can prove a substantive entitlement to (or defend against a deprivation of\xc2\xa0) property.  But the Clause, properly understood, has nothing to say about the existence or scope of the substantive entitlement itself.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, <i>infra</i>.  If petitioners want this Court to rewrite the contours ofthe substantive entitlement contained in the Exoneration Act, they err in invoking <i>procedural </i>due process. See Reply Brief 1\xe2\x80\x932 (\xe2\x80\x9cOur argument sounds in <i>procedural </i>due process\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado \xe2\x80\x9chad no legal right to retain [petitioners\xe2\x80\x99] money\xe2\x80\x9d once their convictions were invalidated.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa011.  If this were true as a matter of state law, then certain provisions of the Exoneration Act\xe2\x80\x94which require the State to return costs, fees, and restitution only in limited circumstances following a conviction\xe2\x80\x99s reversal\xe2\x80\x94would be superfluous.  Thus, to the extent the majority implicitly suggests that petitioners have a state-law right to an automatic refund (a point about which the majority is entirely unclear), it is plainly incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because defendants in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position do not have a substantive right to recover the money they paid to Colorado under state law, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 asserted right to an automatic refund must arise, if at all, from the Due Process Clause itself.  But the Due Process Clause confers no substantive rights.  <i>McDonald</i> v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742\n, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only \xe2\x80\x98process\xe2\x80\x99 before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, in any event, petitioners appear to disavow any substantive due process right to a return of the funds they paid.  See Reply Brief 1\xe2\x80\x932; Tr. of Oral Arg. 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  In the absence of any property right under state law (apart from the right provided by the Exoneration Act, which petitioners decline to invoke), Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to return the money is not a \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[ation]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.  Colorado is therefore not required to provide any process at all for the return of that money.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required them to pay the money at issue.  And no one disputes that Colorado cannot require petitioners to pay any additional costs, fees, or restitution now that their convictions have been invali-dated.  It does not follow, however, that petitioners havea property right in the money they paid pursuant to theirthen-valid convictions, which now belongs to the State and the victims under Colorado law.
