MARSHALL, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case requires us to consider the propriety of an award of counsel fees to a successful plaintiff in a suit brought under \xc2\xa7 102 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 523, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 412. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On August 6, 1962, at a regular meeting of the membership of petitioner Seafarers International Union of North America -- Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District, respondent introduced a set of resolutions alleging various instances of undemocratic actions and shortsighted policies on the part of union officers.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 412 U. S. 3</a></p><p> The resolutions were defeated and, on November 26, 1962, respondent was expelled from the union on the ground that his presentation of the resolutions violated a union rule proscribing "deliberate or malicious vilification with regard to the execution or the duties of any office or job."  After exhausting his intra-union remedies, respondent filed this suit under \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA, claiming that his expulsion under these circumstances violated his right of free speech as secured by \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 411(a)(2). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>On May 27, 1964, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued a temporary injunction restoring respondent\'s membership in the union, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  339 F.2d 881 (1965).  Some five years later, the case came on for trial and the District Court, finding a violation of respondent\'s rights under \xc2\xa7 101-(a)(2), ordered him permanently reinstated to membership in the union and, although denying respondent\'s damages claims, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] granted him counsel fees in the sum of $5,500 against the union.  The Court of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 412 U. S. 4</a></p><p> Appeals affirmed in all respects, 462 F.2d 777 (1972).  We granted certiorari limited to the questions whether (1) an award of attorneys\' fees is permissible under \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA, and (2) if so, whether such an award under the facts of this case constituted an abuse of the District Court\'s discretion.  409 U.S. 1074.  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the traditional American [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] rule ordinarily disfavors the allowance of attorneys\' fees in the absence of statutory [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] or contractual authorization, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] federal courts, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 412 U. S. 5</a></p><p> in the exercise of their equitable powers, may award attorneys\' fees when the interests of justice so require.  Indeed, the power to award such fees "is part of the original authority of the chancellor to do equity in a particular situation," <em>Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/161/case.html">307 U.

S. 166</a></span> (1939), and federal courts do not hesitate to exercise this inherent equitable power whenever "overriding considerations indicate the need for such a recovery."  <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html">396 U.

In this class of cases, the underlying rationale of "fee-shifting" is, of course, punitive, and the essential element in triggering the award of fees is therefore the existence of "bad faith" on the part of the unsuccessful litigant.</p>\n<p>Another established exception involves cases in which the plaintiff\'s successful litigation confers</p>\n<p>"a substantial benefit on the members of an ascertainable class, and where the court\'s jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit makes possible an award that will operate to spread the costs proportionately among them."</p>\n<p><em>Mills v.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  "Fee shifting" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 412 U.

Electric Auto-Lit Co., supra,</em> we approved an award of attorneys\' fees to successful shareholder plaintiffs in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 412 U. S. 7</a></p><p> a suit brought to set aside a corporate merger accomplished through the use of a misleading proxy statement in violation of \xc2\xa7 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 4 Stat. 895, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78n(a).  In reaching this result, we reasoned that, since the dissemination of misleading proxy solicitations jeopardized important interests of both the corporation and "<em>the stockholders as a group,\'" [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the successful enforcement of the statutory policy necessarily "rendered a substantial service to the corporation and its shareholders."  <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#396">396 U. S. 396</a></span>.  Under these circumstances, reimbursement of the plaintiffs\' attorneys\' fees out of the corporate treasury simply shifted the costs of litigation to "the class that has benefited from them and that would have had to pay them had it brought the suit."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#397">396 U. S. 397</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>The instant case is clearly governed by this aspect of <em>Mills.</em>  The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 was based, in part, on a congressional finding</p>\n<p>"from recent investigations in the labor and management fields that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct. . . ."</p>\n<p>29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401(b).  In an effort to eliminate these abuses, Congress recognized that it was imperative that all union members be guaranteed at least "minimum standards of democratic process. . . ." [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Thus, Title I [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] of the LMRDA -- the "Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations"  as specifically designed to promote the "full and active participation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 412 U. S. 8</a></p><p> by the rank and file in the affairs of the union," [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and, as the Court of Appeals noted, the rights enumerated in Title I [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] were deemed</p>\n<p>"vital to the independence of the membership and the effective and fair operation of the union as the representative of its membership."</p>\n<p>462 F.2d at 780.  <em>See also International Assn. of Machinists v. Nix,</em> 415 F.2d 212 (CA5 1969); <em>Salzhandler v. Caputo,</em> 316 F.2d 445 (CA2 1963).</p>\n<p>Viewed in this context, there can be no doubt that, by vindicating his own right of free speech guaranteed by \xc2\xa7 101(a)(2) of Title I of the LMRDA, respondent necessarily rendered a substantial service to his union as an institution, and to all of its members.  When a union member is disciplined for the exercise of any of the rights protected by Title I, the rights of all members of the union are threatened.  And, by vindicating his own right, the successful litigant dispels the "chill" cast upon the rights of others.  Indeed, to the extent that such lawsuits contribute to the preservation of union democracy, they frequently prove beneficial "not only in the immediate impact of the results achieved, but in their implications for the future conduct of the union\'s affairs."  <em>Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America,</em> 150 U.S.App.D.C. 253, 260, 466 F.2d 424, 431 (1972).  Thus, as in <em>Mills,</em> reimbursement of respondent\'s attorneys\' fees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 412 U. S. 9</a></p><p> out of the union treasury [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] simply shifts the costs of litigation to "the class that has benefited from them and that would have had to pay them had it brought the suit."  <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#397">396 U. S. 397</a></span>.   <em>See also Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America, supra; Robins v. Schonfeld,</em> 326 F.Supp. 525 (SDNY 1971); <em>Cefalo v. International Union of District 50 United Mine Workers,</em> 311 F.Supp. 946 (DC 1970); <em>Sands v. Abelli,</em> 290 F.Supp. 677 (SDNY 1968).  We must therefore conclude that an award of counsel fees to a successful plaintiff in an action under \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA falls squarely within the traditional equitable power of federal courts to award such fees whenever "overriding considerations indicate the need for such a recovery."  <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#391">396 U. S. 391</a></span>-392.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This does not end our inquiry, however, for even where "fee-shifting" would be appropriate as a matter of equity, Congress has the power to circumscribe such relief.  In <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., supra,</em> for example, we held that \xc2\xa7 35 of the Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 439, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1117, precluded an award of attorneys\' fees as a separate element of recovery in a suit for deliberate infringement of a trademark.  In reaching that result, we reasoned that, since \xc2\xa7 35 "meticulously detailed the remedies available to a plaintiff </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 412 U. S. 10</a></p><p> who proves that his valid trademark has been infringed," Congress must have intended the express remedial provisions of \xc2\xa7 35 "to mark the boundaries of the power to award monetary relief in cases arising under the Act."  <em>Id.</em> at 719, 721.  Petitioners contend that this reasoning dictates a similar conclusion with respect to \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA.  We do not agree.  Unlike \xc2\xa7 35 of the Lanham Act, which specifically "provided not only for injunctive relief but also for compensatory recovery measured by the profits that accrued to the defendant by virtue of his infringement, the costs of the action, and damages which may be trebled," [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA broadly authorizes the courts to grant "such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 412.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 102 does not "meticulously detail the remedies available to a plaintiff," and we cannot fairly infer from the language of that provision an intent to deny to the courts the traditional equitable power to grant counsel fees in "appropriate" situations.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue further, however, that, because Congress expressly authorized the recovery of counsel fees in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 201(c) and 501(b) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 431(c), 501(b), the absence of a similar express provision in \xc2\xa7 102 indicates an intent to preclude "fee-shifting" in suits brought under that section.  Sections 201(c) and 501(b), which are not a part of Title I, deal with narrowly defined problems under the Act, and specifically authorize such limited remedies as an examination of the union\'s books and records and an accounting. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  By contrast, \xc2\xa7 102 was premised upon the fact </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 412 U. S. 11</a></p><p> that Title I litigation necessarily demands that remedies "be tailored to fit facts and circumstances admitting of almost infinite variety," [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and \xc2\xa7 102 was therefore cast as a broad mandate to the courts to fashion "appropriate" relief.  Indeed, any attempt on the part of Congress to spell out all of the remedies available under \xc2\xa7 102 would create the</p>\n<p>"danger that those [remedies] not listed might be proscribed, with the result that the courts would be fettered in their efforts to \'grant relief according to the necessities of the case.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Gartner v. Soloner,</em> 384 F.2d 348, 353 (CA3 1967).  <em>See Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., supra.</em>  Confronted with a virtually identical situation in <em>Mills,</em> we explained that the inclusion in certain sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of express provisions for recovery of attorneys\' fees</p>\n<p>"should not be read as denying to the courts the power to award counsel fees in suits under other sections of the Act when circumstances make such an award appropriate. . . ."</p>\n<p>396 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#390">396 U. S. 390</a></span>-391.  That reasoning is equally persuasive today. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, petitioners call our attention to two isolated comments in the legislative history of Title I -- one by Senator Goldwater in his testimony before a House Committee [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 412 U. S. 12</a></p><p> and the other contained in a dissenting statement to a House Committee Report [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] -- expressing the fear that, in the absence of a specific provision for the award of counsel fees, such relief would be unavailable in suits brought under \xc2\xa7 102.  Although these statements plainly indicate</p>\n<p>"a feeling by some members of the Congress that it would have been desirable and prudent to spell out unmistakably a right to attorney\'s fees,"</p>\n<p>they</p>\n<p>"hardly amount to a definitive and absolute setting of the Congressional face against the giving of such incidental relief by the courts where compatible with sound and established equitable principles."</p>\n<p><em>Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America,</em> 150 U.S.App.D.C. at 258, 46 F.2d at 429.  <em>See Gartner v. Soloner, supra,</em> at 352.  Indeed, both of these comments expressly favored the allowance of counsel fees in Title I litigation, and there is no suggestion anywhere in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 412 U. S. 13</a></p><p> legislative history that even a single member of Congress was opposed to such relief or desired the words "such relief . . . as may be appropriate" to restrict the historic equity powers of the federal courts.  On the contrary, there are numerous expressions by sponsors and other supporters of the Act indicating that \xc2\xa7 102 was intended to afford the courts "a wide latitude to grant relief according to the necessities of the case," [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] and "to give such relief as [the court] deems equitable under all the circumstances." [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the award of attorneys\' fees under \xc2\xa7 102 is clearly consonant with Congress\' express desire to adopt "legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally. . . ."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 401(b).  As the Court of Appeals recognized:</p>\n<p>"Not to award counsel fees in cases such as this would be tantamount to repealing the Act itself by frustrating its basic purpose.  It is difficult for individual members of labor unions to stand up and fight those who are in charge.  The latter have the treasury of the union at their command and the paid union counsel at their beck and call while the member is on his own. . . .  An individual union member could not carry such a heavy financial burden.  Without counsel fees, the grant of federal jurisdiction is but a gesture for few union members could avail themselves of it."</p>\n<p>462 F.2d at 780-781.  Thus, it is simply</p>\n<p>"untenable to assert that in establishing the bill of rights under the Act Congress intended to have those rights diminished by the unescapable fact that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 412 U.

We therefore hold that the allowance of counsel fees to the successful plaintiff in a suit brought under \xc2\xa7 102 of the LMRDA is consistent with both the Act and the historic equitable power of federal courts to grant such relief in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Finally, petitioners maintain that the award of counsel fees to respondent under the facts of this case constituted an abuse of the District Court\'s discretion.  Specifically, petitioners argue that the District Court\'s finding that some of respondent\'s actions "were, in part, motivated by [his] political ambitions for union office" represents a finding of "bad faith" on the part of respondent.  The District Court clearly rejected the "logic" of this contention, and we agree.  Title I of the LMRDA was specifically designed to protect the union member\'s right to seek higher office within the union, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and we can hardly accept the proposition that the exercise of that right is tantamount to "bad faith."  <em>See Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America, supra,</em> at 259-260, 466 F.2d at 430-431. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 412 U. S. 15</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners also contend that the award of attorneys\' fees in this case was improper because the District Court, in denying respondent\'s claim for punitive damages, found that "the defendants, in good faith, believed that they had a right to charge and discipline [respondent] for his actions."  It is clear, however, that "bad faith" may be found not only in the actions that led to the lawsuit, but also in the conduct of the litigation.  And, as the Court of Appeals noted, the conduct of this particular litigation was marked by "the dilatory action of the union and its officers. . . ."  462 F.2d at 780.  Moreover, although the presence of "bad faith" is essential to "fee-shifting" under a "punishment" rationale, neither the presence nor absence of "bad faith" is in any sense dispositive where attorneys\' fees are awarded to the successful plaintiff under the "common benefit" rationale recognized in <em>Mills</em> and operative today.  Under that theory, counsel fees are granted not because of the "bad faith" of the defendant, but rather because the litigation confers substantial benefits on an ascertainable class of beneficiaries.  In that situation, the element of "bad faith" of the defendant is simply one of many considerations best addressed to the sound discretion of the District Court. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Under the facts of this case, we cannot say that the District Court abused that discretion.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
