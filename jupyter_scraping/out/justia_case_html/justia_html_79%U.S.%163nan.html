He moves the Court to advance the cause.</p>\n<p>Clearly the motion is not within the act of Congress of the thirtieth of June, 1870, as the motion is not filed by the state nor by a party claiming under the laws of the state. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/163/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Probably it is made under the thirtieth rule of the Court, which provides that criminal cases <em>may</em> be advanced by leave of the Court on motion of either party.  Under that rule, the motion is addressed to the discretion of the Court, and inasmuch as it appears that the defendant is not in jail, the Court fails to see any reason for granting the motion.</p>\n<p><em>Motion denied.</em></p>\n<p>* 16 Stat. at Large 176.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
