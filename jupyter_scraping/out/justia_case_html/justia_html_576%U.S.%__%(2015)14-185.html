Mata\xe2\x80\x99s attorney filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board), but never filed a brief, and the appeal was dismissed.  Acting through different counsel, Mata filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings, as authorized by statute.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A).  Acknowledging that he had missed the 90-day deadline for such motions, see \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(C)(i), Mata argued that his previous counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance was an exceptional circumstance entitling him to equitable tolling of the time limit.  But the BIA disagreed and dismissed the motion as untimely.  The BIA also declined to reopen Mata\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceedings <i>sua sponte</i> based on its separate regulatory authority.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.2(a).  On appeal, the Fifth Circuit construed Mata\xe2\x80\x99s equitable tolling claim as an invitation for the Board to exercise its regulatory authority to reopen the proceedings <i>sua sponte</i>, and\xe2\x80\x94because circuit precedent forbids the court to review BIA decisions not to exercise that authority\xe2\x80\x94dismissed Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held:\xc2\xa0</i>The Fifth Circuit erred in declining to take jurisdiction over Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  A court of appeals has jurisdiction to review the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen.  <i>Kucana</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 233\n.  Nothing about that jurisdiction changes where the Board rejects a motion as untimely, or when it rejects a motion requesting equitable tolling of the time limit.  That jurisdiction likewise remains unchanged if the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s denial also contains a separate decision not to exercise its <i>sua sponte</i> authority.  So even assuming the Fifth Circuit is correct that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review BIA decisions not to reopen cases <i>sua sponte</i>, that lack of jurisdiction does not affect jurisdiction over the decision on the alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen.  It thus follows that the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision rested on its construing Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion as an invitation for the Board to exercise its <i>sua sponte</i> discretion.  Court-appointed <i>amicus</i> asserts that the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s recharacterization was based on the premise that equitable tolling in Mata\xe2\x80\x99s situation is categorically forbidden.  In <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s view, the court\xe2\x80\x99s construal was therefore an example of the ordinary practice of recharacterizing a doomed request as one for relief that may be available.  But even if equitable tolling is prohibited, the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s action was not justified.  If Mata is not entitled to relief on the merits, then the correct disposition is to take jurisdiction and affirm the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his motion.  For a court retains jurisdiction even if a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s request for relief lacks merit, see <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, and a federal court has a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unflagging obligation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n, to assert jurisdiction where it has that authority.  Nor can the established practice of recharacterizing pleadings so as to offer the possibility of relief justify an approach that, as here, renders relief impossible and sidesteps the judicial obligation to assert jurisdiction.

In 2010, he was convicted of assault under the Texas Penal Code.  The federal Department of Homeland Secu-rity (DHS) immediately initiated removal proceedings against him, and in August 2011 an IJ ordered him removed.  See App. 6\xe2\x80\x9313.  Mata\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer then filed a notice of appeal with the BIA, indicating that he would soon submit a written brief stating grounds for reversing the IJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But the attorney never filed the brief, and the BIA dismissed the appeal in September 2012.  See App. 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More than a hundred days later, Mata (by then represented by new counsel) filed a motion with the Board to reopen his case.  DHS opposed the motion, arguing in part that Mata had failed to file it, as the INA requires, within 90 days of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Mata responded that the motion was \xe2\x80\x9cnot time barred\xe2\x80\x9d because his first lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cineffective assistance\xe2\x80\x9d counted as an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional circumstance[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d excusing his lateness.  Certified Administrative Record in No. 13\xe2\x80\x9360253 (CA5, Aug. 2, 2013), p. 69.  In addressing those arguments, the Board reaffirmed prior decisions holding that it had authority to equitably toll the 90-day period in certain cases involving ineffective representation.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7; see also, <i>e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Santa Celenia Diaz</i>, 2009 WL 2981747 (BIA, Aug. 21, 2009).  But the Board went on to determine that Mata was not entitled to equitable tolling because he could not show prejudice from his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance; accordingly, the Board found Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion untimely.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And in closing, the Board decided as well that Mata\xe2\x80\x99s case was not one \xe2\x80\x9cthat would warrant reopening as an exercise of\xe2\x80\x9d its <i>sua sponte</i> authority.  <i>Id., </i>at 9 (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mata petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his motion to reopen, arguing that he was entitled to equitable tolling.  The Fifth Circuit, however, declined to \xe2\x80\x9caddress the meritsof Mata\xe2\x80\x99s equitable-tolling .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. claim[\xc2\xa0].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reyes Mata</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 558 Fed. Appx. 366, 367 (2014) (<i>per curiam</i>).  It stated instead that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n this circuit, an alien\xe2\x80\x99s request [to the BIA] for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the BIA to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceeding <i>sua sponte</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>And circuit precedent held that courts have no jurisdiction to review the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to exercise its <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> power to reopen cases.  See <i>ibid.  </i>The Court of Appeals thus dismissed Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Every other Circuit that reviews removal orders has affirmed its jurisdiction to decide an appeal, like Mata\xe2\x80\x99s, that seeks equitable tolling of the statutory time limit to file a motion to reopen a removal proceeding.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  And because the Federal Government agrees with Mata that the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over his appeal, we appointed an <i>amicus curiae</i> to defend the judgment below.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  We now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As we held in <i>Kucana </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, circuit courts have jurisdiction when an alien appeals from the Board\xe2\x80\x99s denial of a motion to reopen a removal proceeding.  See 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 242, 253.  The INA, in combination with a statute cross-referenced there, gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9cfinal order[s] of removal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(1);\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72342.  That jurisdiction, as the INA expressly contemplates, encompasses review of decisions refusingto reopen or reconsider such orders.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(b)(6) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny review sought of a motion to reopen or reconsider [a removal order] shall be consolidated with the review of the [underlying] order\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, as we explained in <i>Kucana</i>, courts have reviewed those decisions for nearly a hundred years; and even as Congress curtailed other aspects of courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction over BIA rulings, it left that authority in place.  See 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at242\xe2\x80\x93251.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing changes when the Board denies a motion to reopen because it is untimely\xe2\x80\x94nor when, in doing so, the Board rejects a request for equitable tolling.  Under the INA, as under our century-old practice, the reason for the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s denial makes no difference to the jurisdictional issue.  Whether the BIA rejects the alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion to re-open because it comes too late or because it falls short in some other respect, the courts have jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, that jurisdiction remains unchanged if the Board, in addition to denying the alien\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily authorized motion, states that it will not exercise its separate <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> authority to reopen the case.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  In <i>Kucana</i>, we declined to decide whether courts have jurisdiction to review the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s use of that discretionary power.  See 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251, n.\xc2\xa018.  Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, have held that they generally lack such authority.  See, <i>e.g., Enriquez-Alvarado </i>v. <i>Ashcroft</i>, 371 F.\xc2\xa03d 246, 249\xe2\x80\x93250 (CA5 2004);<i> Tamenut </i>v. <i>Mukasey</i>, 521 F.\xc2\xa03d 1000, 1003\xe2\x80\x931004 (CA8 2008) (en banc) (<i>per curiam</i>) (citing other decisions).  Assuming <i>arguendo </i>that is right, it means only that judicial review ends after the court has evaluated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  That courts lack jurisdiction over one matter (the <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> decision) does not affect their jurisdiction over another (the decision on the alien\xe2\x80\x99s request).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It follows, as the night the day, that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over this case.  Recall: As authorized by the INA, Mata filed a motion with the Board to reopen his removal proceeding.  The Board declined to grant Mata his proposed relief, thus conferring jurisdiction on an appellate court under <i>Kucana</i>.  The Board did so for timeliness reasons, holding that Mata had filed his motion after 90 days had elapsed and that he was not entitled to equitable tolling.  But as just explained, the reason the Board gave makes no difference: Whenever the Board denies an alien\xe2\x80\x99s statutory motion to reopen a removal case, courts have jurisdiction to review its decision.  In addition, the Board determined not to exercise its <i>sua sponte</i> authority to reopen.  But once again, that extra ruling does not matter.  The Court of Appeals did not lose jurisdiction over the Board\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion just because the Board also declined to reopen his case <i>sua sponte</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit dismissed Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  That decision, as described earlier, hinged on \xe2\x80\x9cconstru[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion as something it was not: \xe2\x80\x9can invitation for the BIA to exercise\xe2\x80\x9d its <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> authority.  558 Fed. Appx., at 367; <i>supra,</i> at 3.  <i>Amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s defense of that approach centrally relies on a merits-based premise: that the INA forbids equitable tolling of the 90-day filing period in any case, no matter how exceptional the circumstances.  See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae </i>by<i> </i>Invitation of the Court 14\xe2\x80\x9335.  Given that is so, <i>amicus </i>continues, the court acted permissibly in \xe2\x80\x9crecharacteriz[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d Mata\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings.  <i>Id.,</i> at 36.  After all, courts often treat a request for \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically unavailable\xe2\x80\x9d relief as instead \xe2\x80\x9cseeking relief [that] may be available.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 35, 38.  And here (<i>amicus </i>concludes) that meant construing Mata\xe2\x80\x99s request for equitable tolling as a request for <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> reopening\xe2\x80\x94even though that caused the Fifth Circuit to lose its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that conclusion is wrong even on the assumption\xe2\x80\x94and it is only an assumption\xe2\x80\x94that its core premise about equitable tolling is true.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  If the INA precludes Mata from getting the relief he seeks, then the right course on appeal is to take jurisdiction over the case, explain why that is so, and affirm the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to reopen.  The jurisdictional question (whether the court has power to decide if tolling is proper) is of course distinct from the merits question (whether tolling is proper).  See <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n89 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he absence of a valid .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Fifth Circuit thus retains jurisdiction even if Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal lacks merit.  And when a federal court has jurisdiction, it also has a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unflagging obligation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to exercise\xe2\x80\x9d that authority.  <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</i> v.<i>United States</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800,\n817 (1976)\n.  Accordingly,the Court of Appeals should have asserted jurisdiction over Mata\xe2\x80\x99s appeal and addressed the equitable tolling question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrary to <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s view,<i> </i>the practice of recharacterizing pleadings so as to offer the possibility of relief cannot justify the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 alternative approach.  True enough (and a good thing too) that courts sometimes construe one kind of filing as another: If a litigant misbrands a motion, but could get relief under a different label, a court will often make the requisite change.  See, <i>e.g., </i>12 J. Moore, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice, \xc2\xa759.11[4] (3 ed. 2015) (explaining how courts treat untimely Rule 59 motions as Rule 60 motions because the latter have no time limit).  But that established practice does not entail sidestepping the judicial obligation to exercise jurisdiction.  And it results in identifying a route to relief, not in rendering relief impossible.  That makes all the difference between a court\xe2\x80\x99s generously reading pleadings and a court\xe2\x80\x99s construing away adjudicative authority.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And if, as <i>amicus </i>argues, that construal rests on an underlying merits decision\xe2\x80\x94that the INA precludes any equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x94then the Court of Appeals has effectively insulated a circuit split from our review.  Putting theFifth Circuit to the side, all appellate courts to have addressed the matter have held that the Board may sometimes equitably toll the time limit for an alien\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen.  See n.\xc2\xa01, <i>supra</i>.  Assuming the Fifth Circuit thinks otherwise, that creates the kind of split of authority we typically think we need to resolve.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 10(a).<b> </b>But the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s practice of recharacterizing appeals like Mata\xe2\x80\x99s as challenges to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> decisions and then declining to exercise jurisdiction over them prevents that split from coming to light.  Of course, the Court of Appeals may reach whatever conclusion it thinks best as to the availability of equitable tolling; we express no opinion on that matter.  See n. 3, <i>supra</i>.  What the Fifth Circuit may not do is to wrap such a merits decision in jurisdictional garb so that we cannot address a possible division between that court and every other.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See, <i>e.g., Da Silva Neves </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 613 F.\xc2\xa03d 30, 33 (CA1 2010) (<i>per curiam</i>) (exercising jurisdiction over such a petition);<i> Iavorski </i>v. <i>INS</i>, 232 F. 3d 124, 129\xe2\x80\x93134 (CA2 2000) (same); <i>Borges </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 402 F. 3d 398, 406 (CA3 2005) (same); <i>Kuusk </i>v. <i>Holder</i>, 732 F. 3d 302, 305\xe2\x80\x93306 (CA4 2013) (same); <i>Barry </i>v. <i>Mukasey</i>, 524 F. 3d 721, 724\xe2\x80\x93725 (CA6 2008) (same); <i>Pervaiz </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 405 F. 3d 488, 490 (CA7 2005) (same); <i>Hernandez-Moran </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 408 F. 3d 496, 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (CA8 2005) (same); <i>Valeriano </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 474 F. 3d 669, 673 (CA9 2007) (same); <i>Riley </i>v. <i>INS</i>, 310 F. 3d 1253, 1257\xe2\x80\x931258 (CA10 2002) (same); <i>Avila-Santoyo </i>v. <i>United States Atty.

Moreover, we are not certain what the Fifth Circuit itself thinks about that question.  Perhaps, as <i>amicus </i>asserts, the court believes the INA categorically precludes equitable tolling: It is hard to come up with any other reason why the court construes every argument for tolling as one for <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> relief.  See Brief for <i>Amicus</i> <i>Curiae </i>by<i> </i>Invitation of the Court 2, 10, 14, n.\xc2\xa02.  But the Fifth Circuit has stated that position in only a single sentence in a single unpublished opinion, which (according to the Circuit) has no precedential force.  See <i>Lin </i>v.<i> Mukasey</i>, 286 Fed. Appx. 148, 150 (2008) (<i>per curiam</i>); Rule 47.5.4 (2015).  And another unpublished decision cuts in the opposite direction, \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing] that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies\xe2\x80\x9d when exceptional circumstances excuse an alien\xe2\x80\x99s failure to meet the 90-day reopening deadline.  See <i>Torabi </i>v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 165 Fed. Appx. 326, 331 (CA5 2006) (<i>per curiam</i>).  So, in the end, it is hard to say.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3420638">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 14\xe2\x80\x93185</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">NOEL REYES MATA, PETITIONER <i>v.</i> LORETTA E.LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 15, 2015]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case elides an important distinction between construing a court filing and recharacterizing it.  See <i>Castro</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375,\n386 (2003)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (discussing this distinction).  Courts routinely construe ambiguous filings to make sense out of them, as parties\xe2\x80\x94both counseled and uncounseled\xe2\x80\x94sometimes submit documents lacking even rudimentary clarity.  See, <i>e.g., Alabama Legislative Black Caucus </i>v. <i>Alabama</i>, 989 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala. 2013) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe filings and arguments made by the plaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best\xe2\x80\x9d).  Recharacterization is something very different: It occurs when a court treats an unambiguous filing as something it is not.  That practice is an unusual one, and should be used, if at all, with caution.  See <i>Castro</i>, 540 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 385\xe2\x80\x93386 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Courts should not approach recharacterization with a freewheeling attitude, but with \xe2\x80\x9cregard to the exceptional nature of recharacterization within an adversarial system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Recharacterization has, for example, been used \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately to override a <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s choice of a procedural vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 386 (disapproving of the practice).  But it is not the role of courts to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a \xe2\x80\x98better correspondence\xe2\x80\x99 between the substance of a claim and its underlying procedural basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, then, it makes all the difference whether the Court of Appeals here properly construed an ambiguous motion or recharacterized an unambiguous motion contrary to Mata\xe2\x80\x99s stated choice of procedural vehicle.  Although the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not address this point, Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reopen does not expressly state whether he was invoking statutory relief under\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A) or instead requesting <i>sua sponte</i> reopening under the Board of Immigration Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 asserted inherent authority.  Had the Court of Appeals engaged in the discretionary action of construing that ambiguous filing, it might not have abused its discretion by concluding that Mata really meant to ask for <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> reopening rather than equitable tolling of the statutory time bar.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals, however, did not purport to construe an ambiguous motion.  Instead, it applied what appears to be a categorical rule that all motions to reopen that would be untimely under \xc2\xa71229a(c)(7)(A) must be construed as motions for <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> reopening of the proceedings.  See 558 Fed. Appx. 366, 367 (CA5 2014) (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn this circuit, an alien\xe2\x80\x99s request for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the BIA to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceeding <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i>\xe2\x80\x9d).  That rule would appear to foreclose a litigant from ever filing an untimely statutory motion to reopen removal proceedings seeking equitable tolling, as well as to invite improper recharacterization in the event any such a motion is filed.  The Court of Appeals should have assessed Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion on its own terms.  It erred in not doing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The reason it erred, though, has nothing to do with its fidelity to our precedents discussing \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial obligation to exercise jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 7.  That obligation does not allow evasion of constitutional and statutory jurisdictional prerequisites.  It is true that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a federal court has jurisdiction, it also has a \xe2\x80\x98virtually unflagging obligation to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exercise\xe2\x80\x99 that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800,\n817 (1976)\n).  But that \xe2\x80\x9cunflagging obligation\xe2\x80\x9d arises only if a court actually has jurisdiction.  Federal courts have no obligation to seek out jurisdiction, nor should they misconstrue filings to satisfy jurisdictional requirements.  Rather, federal courts should \xe2\x80\x9cpresume that [they] lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Cuno</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332\n, n.\xc2\xa03 (2006).  And they should apply the ordinary rule that the party asserting federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that jurisdictional prerequisites are met.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The practice of construing filings does not alter the usual rules of establishing jurisdiction in federal court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to consider the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s judgment without the burden of what appears to be a categorical rule demanding that Mata\xe2\x80\x99s motion be construed (or recharacterized) as a request for <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i> reopening.  Because the majority does more than this by reversing the judgment below, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
